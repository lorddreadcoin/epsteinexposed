I sent a separate email with \nthem, but I've copied the details below just in case: \nI'd like to arrange the following travel, all with refundable tickets, please: \nDecember 15, 2019 -11:40 AM Delta flight from JFK to LAX \nDecember 16, 2019 — 4:15 PM United flight from LAX to IAD \nDecember 17, 2019 —  Amtrak 6:00 PM train from DC to NYC \nI'd also like to book a room in the Double Tree Santa Monica for one night, checking in December 15, 2019 and checking \nout December 16, 2019 in LA, please. No need for a hotel in DC, as I'll be staying with family. \nWe do not need a conference room for any portion of this trip. \nThank you! \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, December 12, 2019 6:10 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n>: \nSubject: FW: travel approval request \nH i \nIn connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! \n• Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day \n• We do not need a conference room \n• Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. \n• Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. \n• If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of \nthis if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. \nThanks a bunch. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, December 11, 2019 10:01 AM \nTo: \n> \nEFTA00019839\n\nCc: \n>; \n>; \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nApproved \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, December 11, 2019 9:58 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n> \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \n> \n>; >; \nSimilar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request \npermission for the team to travel next week for an interview (or possibly interviews) in Los Angeles on December 16 \nand/or 17.
