Almost everything is over at Southern once I drop off the phones. Just I  laptop and 2 desktops to get to you. I  has to \nre-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have already produced, I  can re-work it to split \nthings out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get \nsomething moving. Any questions, let me know. \nNYO \nCART Coordinator \nSenior Forensic Examiner \n(office) \n(cell) \nEFTA00024719",
