As discussed, we would appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, \nand we will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any \nquestions, and let us know what time and where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor \nbridge. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nrk \nEFTA00022630",
