In any event, we'll be in touch tomorrow. \nsi\nhanks \nFrom: Martin Weinberg I \nSent: Sunda Jul 07 2019 18:13 \nTo: \nCc: Martin Weinberg \nSubject: Re: U.S. v. Jeffrey Epstein \nThanks for trying \nI tried again, without success \nReid and i will call you in morning \nMarty \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jul 7, 2019, at 5:23 PM, \nMarty, \nwrote: \nFollowing up briefly on our earlier conversation, I wanted to advise you that we expect to be able to unseal the \nindictment and have the case assigned to a district judge at approximately 9:15 a.m. tomorrow morning, after which we \ncan email and/or call you, or anyone you'd prefer we reach out to at that time. \nSeparately, I may have conveyed this previously, but in case not, please feel free to call my cell anytime tonight (or early \ntomorrow morning) if it would be useful to speak after you've met with Mr. Epstein—there's no time too late or too \nearly to call, I'll be up. Particularly if you expect not to make a bail argument tomorrow, but rather consent to detention \nwithout prejudice to make an application in the coming days—we would just want to let the judge know that early \ntomorrow, if possible, if that's how ou prefer to proceed. Certainly understand if not, of course, but just to mention it. \nIn any event, my cell i \nThank you, and talk soon. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, July 06, 2019 20:52 \nTo: 'Martin G.
