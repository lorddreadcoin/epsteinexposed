Because this individual does not represent any witnesses in this case, we do not see a need to raise this issue with \nthe Court. \nWe agree that compliance with Local Rule 23.1 is important. To that end, we note that David Markus, an attorney who \nhas filed a notice of appearance in the Second Circuit on behalf of Ms. Maxwell, and who was present for the arraignment \nbefore Judge Nathan last month, has also made public statements to the press regarding this case, which run the risk of \nviolating the rule. See, e.g., https://nypost.com/2021/05/05/ghislaine-maxwell-on-enhanced-security-schedule-lockup-\nfecIst \nOur hope is that by alerting you to this concern now, there will not be a need in the future to raise the issue with the \nCourt. \nBest, \nFrom: Laura Menninger <Imenninger@hmflaw.com> \nSent: Friday, May 7, 2021 5:18 PM \nTo: \n>; \n(USANYS) \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliuca@hmflaw.com>; iceverdell@cohengresser.com' <ceverdell@cohengresser.com>; 'Bobbi \nSternheim (bcsternheim@mac.com)' <bcsternheim@mac.com> \nSubject: Conferral Regarding Possible Violation of Local Criminal Rule 23.1 \nCounsel — \nThe linked article by the Sun dated yesterday contains a number of statements which, if made by a lawyer associated with \na witness in this case, appear to violate Local Criminal Rule 23.1. See also Dkt. No. 28 (expectation of strict compliance \nwith Rule 23.1 by \"counsel for all involved parties\"). The rule applies by its terms to any \"lawyer participating in or \nassociated with the investigation (including ... lawyers for targets, subjects, and witnesses in the investigation...):' \nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14875477/ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-same-fate-as-epstein/ \nI am writing to confer with you prior to bringing this to the Court's attention. Please let me know if you believe Mr. \nSpencer Kuvin represents any witness in this case. \nGiven the urgency of this situation, I would appreciate a response by close of business Monday. \nEFTA00014661\n\nThanks, \nLaura \nLaura A.
