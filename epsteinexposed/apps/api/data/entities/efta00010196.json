Mono Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York. New York 10007 \nDecember 1, 2020 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nUSDC SONY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY FILED \nDOC 0: \nDATE \nFILED: \n1212120\nThe parties jointly submit this letter in response to the Court's November 24, 2020 order \ndirecting the parties to meet and confer regarding the defendant's request that the warden of the \nMetropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") report directly to the Court and counsel on the \ndefendant's conditions of detention. (Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has \nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant's conditions of confinement and has tried \nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the \nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense \ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense's request relating to MDC Warden \nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions \nfollow. \nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allow MDC legal counsel to \nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense \ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant's conditions of confinement. The Government \nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a letter by this Friday, December 4, \n2020. Such a letter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allow the Court to hear \ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant's conditions of confinement. The \nletter will allow the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by \nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not \nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant's access to legal materials \nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government's letter dated \nNovember 23, 2020, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any \nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC \ninmate to communicate with her attorneys. (Dkt. No. 74). \nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense's position is as \nfollows: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns \nregarding Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October \n29, 2020, the defense emailed a letter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive \nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive \nEFTA00010196\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 78 Filed \n12/02/20 Page 2 of 2 \nPage 2 \nsearching (e.g., weekly body scan, 15-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth \ninspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a  dedicated three-guard security detail and two \ncameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the \noriginal plan (and would reduce searching). Receipt of the letter was acknowledged, but to date \nthere has been no response and little, if any, redress to the most serious conditions. Upon \ninformation and belief, decisions concerning Ms. Maxwell's specialized detention are made by \nWarden Tellez, or from others outside the MDC. A report from the MDC Legal Department would \nprovide second-hand information. Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be directed to provide a \nfirst-hand accounting to the Court and counsel why Ms. Maxwell is being detained under such \nindividualized conditions. \nYour consideration is greatly appreciated. \nRespectfully submitted, \nAUDREY STRAUSS \nActing United States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF) \nMDC legal counsel shall submit their \nletter to the Court by December 4, \n2020. Upon review of that letter, the \nCourt will determine whether any \nadditional information is required, \neither orally or in writing. \nSO \nORDERED. 12/2/2020 \nSO \nORDERED. \nAlison J. Nathan, \nU.S.D.J. \nEFTA00010197",
