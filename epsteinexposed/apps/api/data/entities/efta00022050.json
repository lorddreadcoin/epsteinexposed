The protocol asks that all \nreviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of \nthe Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. \nOnce the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a \ncall with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. \nIn the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: \n• NYC024363 \n• NYC024394 \n• NYC024326 \n• NYC024368 \n• NYC024390 \n• NYC024334 \n• NYC027910 \n• NYC024323 \n• NYC024355 \n• NYC027908 \nDepending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the \nteams. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00022050",
