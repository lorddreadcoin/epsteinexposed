Ghislaine Maxwell \nIn orders dated October 14 and November 24, 2021, the S.D.N:Y. Court outlined procedures for public access to the trial in \nthis matter. (Trial began on November 29, 2021, with jury selection.) Specifically, consistent with the District's COVID-19 \nprotocols, the Court will ensure public access (with COVID-19 distancing) to the trial in the courtroom itself and in \nseveral overflow rooms at the courthouse with live feeds of the proceedings. Beyond the live feeds within the \ncourthouse, the trial will not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic dial-in to the proceedings. Victim \naccess will be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office Victim-Witness Coordinator, \n, and Mr. Joseph Pecorino of the Court's District Executive Office a, \n. Victims who wish to attend the trial may contact either one of those persons \nfor further \ninformation. \nEFTA00010943\n\nCOVID-19 Protocols. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must \ncomplete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their \ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the \nquestionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All visitors must \nwear a mask that covers the person's nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves are not permitted. If a \nperson does not have an approved mask, a screener will provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 \nprotocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions.
