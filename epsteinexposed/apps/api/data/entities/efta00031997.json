New York 10007 \nJanuary 27, 2020 \nMEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, \nASSISISTANT \nDIRECTOR, \nREENTRY SERVICES DIVISION \nFROM: \nSUBJECT: \nicon-Vitale, Warden, MCC New York \nInstitution Response to Psychological Reconstruction \nInmate Epstein, \nJeffrey (76318-054) \nThis is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054) dated \nDecember 27, 2019. \n2. 30 Minute Rounds \nThe substance of the two hour Captain video review and six hour 1DO video review is unclear. Please clarify \nthe requirement for the Captain and IDO. Additionally, please identify the documentation used to maintain \naccountability of the reviews. \nInstitution Response: \nVideo review \nrequirements have been instituted by NERO. Specifically, on Tuesday of each week, the \ninstitution is notified by NERO of the date, time, and SHU \nrange in which to download video. The video is a \ntwo hour block. The video is to be reviewed by the Captain. During the reviews the Captain is looking for \nstrict adherence to the requirements that rounds be conducted at least once during every 30-minute period, not to \nexceed 40 minutes between rounds and that all scheduled counts are being conducted in the SHU. The Captain \nwill then submit an assurance memo to the institutional executive staff and Correctional Services \nAdministrator \n(CSA) indicating the designated video footage was \nreviewed, and corrective actions which were taken for any \ndeficiencies noted. This \nmemorandum will be submitted to the Regional Office by COB on Friday of that same \nweek. Institutional Duty Officers (IDOs) are required to review 6 hours of SHU \nvideo. The surveillance \nfootage is downloaded by the institutional \nSIA \nand a \ncompact disk is provided to the 1DOs for review. The \nIDOs are reviewing the video for \naccuracy of the 30 minute rounds. All reviews are documented in the weekly \n113O Report. \n1 \nEFTA00031997\n\nPage 0685 \nDocumentation \nexists reflecting the \nrole of the local \nPsychology \nServices department \nin \ncommunicating the \nimportance \nof Mr. Epstein's \nstatus as a sex \noffender with specific \nneeds to the \nAssociate Warden. \nThis includes \nconsultation with the \nPsychology Services Branch in \nCentral Office. The \ncommunication chain \nand decision \nmaking \nof Executive Staff \nlacks transparency as \nthere is no \ndocumentation of the process or \nstaff members \npresent when \ndecisions were made about \nthe housing of Mr. \nEpstein. After the fact \nexplanations may not \naccurately reflect what occurred. \nInstitution Response: \nAs was \nnoted, there was no documentation \nindicating Psychology Services was \npresent when housing decisions \nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. \nPsychology services is present at the \nweekly SHU meeting, Executive \nStaff \nmeetings, \nand weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. \nDuring these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or \nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and \nfeedback to the Executive Staff on \nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for \nsuicidality. When an inmate \npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who \nhave been charged with and/or convicted of a \nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing \nthese inmates with appropriate cellmates. \nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these \nmeetings where \nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with \npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs. \nPlease see the attached checklist. \n4. Documentation Accuracy \nProfessional responsibility requires taking \ninto account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted \nin your response. However, when discrepancies exist these \nshould be compiled and noted in \ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions. \nAs noted in the reconstruction report, \nan incident report must be written within 24 hours of having \nthe information that an inmate \nlikely violated BOP rules. An incident report was written for Mr. \nEpstein prior to a determination of \nwhether he engaged in self-directed violence or was assaulted on \nJuly 23, 2019. Staff had ample time to wait for the outcome of the SIS investigation of this \nincident. \nThe incident report presumed self-directed violence, although SIS was not able to \ndetermine whether \nthis incident was self-directed violence or an assault. \nGenerating the incident report for self-directed \nviolence is evidence of a local bias \nabout the July 23, 2019, incident that still exists amongst some \nstaff at MCC New York. Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative \nexplanations, and subsequent \nsystemic changes may be needed. \nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum \nreviews the time frame for \nwriting incident reports and offers \nguidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include \nan outline of the training and \nevidence of staff who attended the \ntraining. \nInstitution \nResponse: \nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our \nAnnual Training presentations for Report Writing. In \naddition to the established training, the slides \nfurther differentiate and provide guidance to staff \nregarding when \nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report \nand when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more \nappropriate. The additional \ninformation is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual \nTraining. Annual \nTraining began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through \nthe week of March 8, 2020. \n2 \nEFTA00031998\n\nPage \n0686 \n5. \nTelephone Calls \nAs noted in the \nresponse. \nthere is a lack of \ndocumentation to \nsubstantiate that a \nlieutenant \nfacilitated two \ntelephone \ncalls to Mr. \nEpstein. However, this \ndoes not \naddress the report of \ntwo telephone \ncalls being \nprovided. \nThis \nresponse implies that \nthe reporting of two \nstaff members is \ninaccurate. \nThe \nresponse neglects \nthe documented \ntelephone call to \nMr. Epstein's \ndeceased mother. \nInstitution \nResponse: \nOn August 29, 2019, \nWarden J. Petrucci, signed a \nreferral related to \nfailure to follow \npolicy in \nallowing Epstein to \ncomplete an unmonitored \nphone call. The referral \nwas submitted to the \nOffice of Internal \nAffairs on that \nsame date and is pending \nfurther action at this time. \n7. Follow\n-Up \nPlease \nprovide documentation for the \nfollow-up training provided to staff \ndetailing the content of the \ntraining \nand to whom it \nwas provided. \nInstitution \nResponse: \nAs recommended by Central Office, the Chief \nPsychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings \nduring \nDepartment Head \nMeetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenant's \nTrainings. The \nfollow-up training sign-in \nsheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails \nprovided by psychology staff \nregarding PSY \nALERT Inmates are attached for your review. \n8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy \nPeriodic and unannounced checks are now conducted in \nSHU to determine pp30 assignments and actual inmate \nplacement match. Please provide an operational definition \nof periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it \nrelates Executive Staff bed \nbook counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be \ndocumented \nand will \nthey include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them? \nInstitution Response: \nAn Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule \nhas been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and 10 A.M. \nweekend bed book counts. Any discrepancies noted are documented and sent via email to \nUnit Mangers and \nCaptain at the conclusion of each count for corrective action. Please see the attached schedule. \n9. Attorney Log Books \nPlease provide a copy of the \nlog book \naudit. \nInstitution Response: \nThe audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat \nsearches after May 19. 2019. In \naddition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The ContractorNolunteer Log \nBook was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of \ndeparture was not \nalways \ndocumented. The \nAttorney Log \nwas missing \ninmate \nregister numbers and more often \nthan not was legible. There was no Visitor Denial Log created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is \nattached for your \nreview. \n3 \nEFTA00031999\n\nPage 0687 \nAdditional corrective measures will now include the \nActivities Lieutenant checking all Front Lobby log books. \nThe Captain will ensure these checks are included in the Lieutenant's Daily Log for Day Watch and \nEvening \nWatch. \nIn addition, the Activities Lieutenant will address any discrepancies immediately through on \nthe spot \ntraining and/or performance log entries. \n13. Sex Offense Risk Factors \nPsychologists are subject matter experts in sex offender risk \nfactors and they play a crucial role in sharing this \nknowledge through \ntraditional settings such as ICT, AT, and institutional meetings. However, Executive Staff \nplay a \npivotal role in establishing and addressing institutional culture and promoting and participating in \ntraining. A lack of a broad \nunderstanding of sex offender specific risk factors requires an intentional training \napproach led by Executive Staff. They must be out \nfront talking about inmates with a sex offense, expressing an \nunderstanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency condoned expectations for the understanding and \ntreatment of inmates with a sex \noffenses, and assisting with institutional trainings. These practices encourage a \nbroader acceptance \nby line staff. \nInstitution Response: \nThe MCC New York Executive Staff are out front talking about inmates with sex offenses, and expressing an \nunderstanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency expectations \nfor the understanding and treatment of \ninmates with sex offenses. This is done through departmental \nmeetings, trainings, staff recalls and walking and \ntalking throughout the institution. \nATTACHED DOCUMENTS: \nInstitution Duty Officer Report \nCellmate \nReview \nReport Writing \"Back to Basics Training\" \nSHU Suicide Prevention Training \nDepartment Head Meeting minutes \nPSY ALERT inmates \nBed Book Count Schedule (Exec Staff/IDO) \nBed Book Audit (emails) \nLog Book Audit \nExecutive Staff List \n4 \nEFTA00032000",
