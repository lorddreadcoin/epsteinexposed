Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), \nand its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This \ndisclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information \nconstitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. \nSpecifically, the Government discloses the following: \n• The victim identified in the Indictment as \"Victim-1\" received a grand jury subpoena \nfrom the Southern District of Florida (\"SDFL\") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 \nwas never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police \nDepartment, Federal Bureau of investigation (\"FBI\") or SDFL in connection with their \ninvestigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was \nfirst interviewed by law enforcement regarding Jeffrey Epstein in or about 2019, after \nFBI agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-\n1. The victims identified in the Indictment as \"Victim-2\" and \"Victim-3\" we both \ninterviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation in or around \n2007. Please note that all three of these victims are currently represented by counsel. \n• During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the \nvictim identified in the Indictment as \"Victim-2\" stated that during her first contact with \nthe defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she \nwas younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law \nenforcement that the first time she met Epstein, she told him that she was 16, when in fact \nshe was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other victims to \nthe defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these victims that \nthey should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. Over time, \nhowever, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to understand that \nthe defendant had a specific preference for underage girls. \n• During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness \n(\"Witness-1\") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls \nfor sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: \"the younger the \nbetter.\" Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen \nto the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over \neighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 \nremarked of the defendant: \"He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20.\" \nWitness-1 is represented by Rita Glavin, Esq. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00018620\n\nPage 4 \nGovernment will provide material under Giglio v.  United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), \nand its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed upon by \nthe parties or set by the Court. \nDisclosure by the Defendant \nIn light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests \nreciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow \ninspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the \ndefendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as \nevidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental \nexaminations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies \nthereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to \nintroduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the \ndefendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he \nwill call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We \nrequest that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to \nsupply the \ndefendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. \nSentence \nReduction for Acceptance of Responsibility \nThis Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines \navailable for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations \npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks \nprior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions \nremain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court \nsix weeks in advance of the trial. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00018621\n\nPage 5 \nFinally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, \nno plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives \nof the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not \nreduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not \nconstitute a \"formal offer\" or a \"plea offer,\" as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. \n1376 (2012); Missouri v. Fiye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012). \nVery truly \nyours, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nby: \nEnclosure \nAssistant United States Attorneys \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00018622",
