    "text": "\n\nFrom: \"  \nci \nTo: :MEW)\" <1 \nSubject: RE: piling on \nDate: Sat, 11 Jul 2020 02:38:21 +0000 \nThanks for looking. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, July 10, 2020 7:33 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: piling on \nI haven't been able to find anything in which Maxwell's attorneys claim they don't know where Maxwell is. That \nstatement was only reported on (as best I can tell) in this article \n(https://creativedestructionmed ia.cominews/politics/2020/01/23/ghisla \ni \nne-maxwell s-lawyers-adm it-they-dont-know-\nwhere-she-is-either/), which refers to a letter filed with Judge Preska in January 2020, and dated December 2019. The \narticle claims that the letter admitted Maxwell's lawyers don't know where their client is. Maxwell's attorneys filed one \nletter from that time period to Judge Preska that I've found. That letter does not include any suggestion that Maxwell's \ncounsel does not know where Maxwell is. Rather, the letter cites to newspaper articles about the frenzied attempts of \nreporters to track Maxwell down. So seems that the article misrepresented the letter from Maxwell's attorneys. \nIn case it's helpful, though, I found a couple orders permitting alternative service because of plaintiffs' inability to serve \nMaxwell. \nHere is a  text order in case approving alternative service after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept service. \n06/15/2020 45 ORDER granting 43 Motion To Approve Alternate Service on Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell \n(\"Maxwell\"). Plaintiffs motion is unopposed, and, based on Plaintiffs representations regarding \nher unsuccessful efforts to locate Maxwell's current residence, her fruitless attempts to serve \nMaxwell at multiple locations, her equally fruitless attempts to contact Maxwell via several \nemail addresses publicly associated with Maxwell, and her rejected request to Maxwell's \nknown litigation counsel to accept service on Maxwell's behalf, this Court finds that Plaintiff has \nadequately demonstrated that she has made diligent efforts to effect service, and that personal \nservice would be impracticable. See Ransome v. Epstein, No. 17cv616 (JGK), 2018 WL 637421, \nat *1 (S.D.NY. Jan. 30, 2018); see also Farmer v. lndyke, No. 19cv10475 (LGS)(DF) (Text Order, \ndated Feb. 12, 2020). This Court further finds that Plaintiff's provision of a copy of the \nSummons and Complaint by email to Maxwell's current counsel of record in the Farmer case \n(see Declaration of Robert S. Glassman, dated May 27, 2020 (Dkt. 43-2), Ex. 3) was reasonably \ncalculated to place Maxwell on notice of this suit and to constitute sufficient service under the \ncircumstances presented here. No later than 6/18/20, Plaintiff is directed to serve Maxwell with \na copy of this Text Order by the same means (i.e., by email to Maxwell's counsel of record in the \nFarmer case), and to file proof of such service on the Docket of this action. Maxwell may then \nhave until 7/9/20 to move, answer, or otherwise respond to the Complaint. (HEREBY ORDERED \nby Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman)(Text Only Order) (Freeman, Debra) (Entered: 06/15/2020) \nAnd here is a similar text order granting the same request a case after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept \nservice. \nEFTA00020397\n\n06/15/2020 45 ORDER granting 43 Motion To Approve Alternate Service on Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell \n(\"Maxwell\"). Plaintiffs motion is unopposed, and, based on Plaintiff's representations regarding \nher unsuccessful efforts to locate Maxwell's current residence, her fruitless attempts to serve \nMaxwell at multiple locations, her equally fruitless attempts to contact Maxwell via several \nemail addresses publicly associated with Maxwell, and her rejected request to Maxwell's \nknown litigation counsel to accept service on Maxwell's behalf, this Court finds that Plaintiff has \nadequately demonstrated that she has made diligent efforts to effect service, and that personal \nservice would be impracticable.

This Court further finds that Plaintiff's provision of a copy of the \nSummons and Complaint by email to Maxwell's current counsel of record in the Farmer case \n(see Declaration of Robert S.
