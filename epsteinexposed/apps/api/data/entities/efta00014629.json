It is not quite physically \nproduced yet and it needs to be cite checked, but I should \nhave \nit on the docket in the next hour, two hours at most. What \nwill do, however, is state the conclusions in the decision and \norder, which I had said I \nwould do, and summarize very briefly \nthe contents of the \nruling for you. \nStarting with my conclusions, the government's \napplication for continued remand is hereby granted and the \ndefense application for pretrial release is respectfully hereby \ndenied. Written opinion to follow. \nIn that opinion I will deal with all, I'll try to, all \nthe principal issues which have been briefed. \nEven though it \nis not entirely necessary or legally required to consider both \ndangerousness to others and to the community as well \nas risk of \nflight, I have done \nso. I also deal with the defense's \nproposed bail package. There is obviously \nsignificant public \ninterest in all of these legal issues, so I tried to \ncover them \nall as best I could. \nThere are the following \nheadings in the decision and \norder. First is a background section, followed by counsel's \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00014630\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nJ7irepsd \nsubmissions. Those are the written \nsubmissions: principally \nthe indictment, \nthe legal principles governing release versus \nremand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591 \ncases, danger to others and the community. This \ntopic has \nseven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and \norder. I think it is \nfair to say that it is the heart of this \ndecision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to \nthe \ncommunity. \nThen I deal with risk of flight. That has \nfour \nsubsections or factors, which are substantially the same \nfactors that are used to analyze dangerousness. \nThen, finally, the \nbail package proposed by the \ndefense. Specifically, I find in the decision and order that \nthe government has established dangerousness to others and to \nthe community by clear and convincing evidence and also \nthat \nthe government has established risk of \nflight by a \npreponderance of the evidence. I also reject the proposed bail \npackage as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail \nconcerning what I consider to be its deficiencies. \nIncidentally, I am not suggesting that a different \nbail package would be appropriate because I doubt \nthat any b[_i_ \npackage can overcome danger to the community. \nI focus then on dangerousness to others, most \ncertainly including the minor \nvictims in this case and \nprospective victims as well. I cite and quote, for example, \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00014631\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nJ7irepsd \n4 \nthe compelling \ntestimony of , who \ntestified that they fear for their safety and the safety of \nothers if Mr. \nEpstein were to be released. \nI also point out that the presumption of remand, as \nopposed to the presumption of release, is unusual in \nour \njurisprudence and that it attaches only to very serious crimes, \nsuch as \nsex trafficking involving minor victims, as in this \ncase some allegedly as young as age 14. \nI also discuss evidence of intimidation and threats \nand compensation paid to potential witnesses and the facts \nsurrounding \nwhether or not Mr. Epstein has been compliant with \nhis legal obligations as a registered sex offender. \nWhen discussing risk of flight, which \nyou obviously \ncan tell comes after, in my analysis, dangerousness to the \ncommunity, when discussing that aspect, risk of flight, the \ndecision speaks to the seriousness of the charged crimes, to \nMr. Epstein's great wealth and his vast resources, which \ninclude private planes and frequent international travel and \nalso a foreign \nresidence in Paris. \nI mention \nthe items very recently seized from Mr. \nEpstein's New York \nCity mansion pursuant to lawful search \nwarrants, which include \nsexually explicit photos and discs, \nsome $70,000 in cash, diamonds, and an expired \nAustrian \npassport with Mr. Epstein's photo but with a name that is \ndifferent from Jeffrey \nEpstein, and also contains a reference \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00014632\n\nJ7irepsd \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nto Saudi Arabia as a residence. \nI think I have given you \na fair account of the \ndecision and order. As I said before, \nthe written version in \nits complete form, which will be about 30 to 34 pages long I \nimagine, I hope will be \navailable reasonably soon. \nOne piece of business in light of \ntoday's ruling. \nthought I would schedule a conference with the parties for \nWednesday, July 31, at 11:00 a.m. That is not fixed in \nstone. \nIf you all want to meet and confer and let me \nknow if that is a \nconvenient date, or I'm happy to accommodate you with another \ndate as \nwell. \nFor the moment, \nI'll tentatively schedule a conference \nfor July 31st at 11:00 a.m. and ask if there is an application \nfor exclusion of speedy trial. \n:  Yes, your Honor. The government \nmoves to \nexclude time under the Speedy Trial Act from today's date until \nJuly 31st. \nTHE COURT: I am going \nto find under 18 United States \nCode section 3161 that adjournment to and including July 31 at \n11:00 a.m. is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the \nadjourned time from speedy trial \ncalculations. I further find \nthat the exclusion is designed to prevent any possible \nmiscarriage of justice, to facilitate these proceedings, and to \nguarantee effective representation of and preparation by all \ncounsel for both parties, both sides. Thus, the need for \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00014633\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nJ7irepsd 6 \nexclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of the \npublic and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. section 3161(h)\n(7)(A) and (B). \nFinally, a word about the proposed conference. From \nmy point of view, it \nwould be more or less a scheduling/case \nmanagement type conference, but I'm happy to consider any \nissues that you might have at that time. \nI think \nthat's it. Everybody, thank you for being \nhere. We are adjourned. \n(Adjourned) \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00014634",
