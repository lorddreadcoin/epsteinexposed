Please bring 40 copies (stapled upper left) with you to the focus group on Saturday. \nThe Verdict Questions are printed at the end of the questionnaire. The facilitators orally encourage the juries to reach a unanimous \nverdict, but ultimately each juror marks their own verdict sheet with their own individual vote. If the verdict is not unanimous, we see \nwhich jurors voted for the defense, and during the debrief after the deliberations on each count we find out why they voted the way they \ndid. \nWill you be bringing binders with copies of documents for jurors to refer to? \nEFTA00027576\n\n> On Sep 21, 2021, at 11:05 AM, Echenberg, (USANYS) wrote: \n> <Fyrrell - Focus Group Questionnaire (LP.AM) TAM.docx> \nEFTA00027577",
