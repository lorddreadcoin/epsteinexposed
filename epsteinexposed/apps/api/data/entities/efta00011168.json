    "text": "\n\nExhibit P \nEFTA00011168\n\nowner o \nStatement of \n, am a forensic accountant and private investigator, and the \nI received a BA in Economics from \nLehman College in 1973 and an \nadvanced degree in Personal Financial Planning \nfrom Lehman College in 1997. I have been a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) \nsince receiving that designation in 1997. \n2. \nPrior to \nentering the private sector, I was a Special Agent \nkith \nthe Internal \nRevenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division \n(IRS\n-CID) from 1973 until \nmy retirement in 1998. As a Special Agent, I  worked on numerous financial \nfraud investigations, including several with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York. In addition, \nduring the last five years of my \nemployment with the IRS, I received the designation of Cross-Designation \nAuthority from the FBI while being a member of the joint task force with the \nFBI and the NYPD whose responsibilities were to \ninvestigate the federal \nmoney laundering statutes on a national and international scale. \n3. I have over forty years of experience in complex financial fraud \ninvestigations, including: income tax violations, white collar crime, and \nsecurities fraud. I  also have extensive field experience in the tracing of assets \nand reviewing books and \nrecords to recognize, identify, and trace suspicious \n1 \nEFTA00011169\n\nfinancial activity. I  have also conducted numerous forensic investigative \naudits. \n4. I  have been hired by federal \nand state law enforcement agencies on numerous \noccasions to serve as a forensic accountant/investigator for corporate \nmonitorships and other compliance programs. For example, I was a member \nof the World Trade Center Integrity Compliance Program administered by the \nNew York City Department of Investigation. My responsibilities included \npreventing and detecting wasteful or abusive \npractices by contractors at the \nWorld Trade Center site. My work consisted of reviewing \nthe books and \nrecords, including workers payroll records and invoices, and detailing any \nfraud discovered in final summary reports. \n5. For this engagement, I  was hired by Cohen & Gresser LLP to conduct an \nindependent review of a Financial Condition Report prepared by Macalvins \nAccountants summarizing the financial condition and assets of Ghislaine \nMaxwell for the time period 2015-2020. I  was asked to verify the accuracy of \nthe representations contained in the Independent Accountants' Commentary \nand the accompanying Statement of Financial Condition including related \nExcel schedules \ndocumenting the findings. \n6. I reviewed the Independent Accountants' Commentary, the Statement of \nFinancial Condition, and the Excel schedules. To complete my review, I was \ngiven access to all of the underlying documents relied upon by Macalvins to \nprepare the Financial Condition Report, and I  reviewed these underlying \ndocuments to the extent necessary to \nverify the representations in the \n2 \nEFTA00011170\n\nFinancial Condition Report. I  also posed questions to the Macalvins \naccountants and requested additional documents that I  required to confirm the \namounts listed in the Financial \nCondition Report and accompanying \nschedules. At all times, I was given complete access to the relevant \ndocuments \nand allowed to ask any questions I  thought pertinent to my \nanalysis. \nConclusion \n7. Based on my review, I  believe that the Financial Condition Report represents \na complete and accurate summary of the assets held by Ms. Maxwell and her \nhusband, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in trust for the \nbenefit of Ms. Maxwell, for the time period from 2015-2020. \n3 \nEFTA00011171",
