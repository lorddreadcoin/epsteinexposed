First, would it be o.k. with all of you if we did the call with =tomorrow at 4P.M. e.s.t as a \nconference call rather than as a Skype call? We will be in at least 4 different locations and I think it will be easier if we \ndid it that way. If so, please send us the number to dial. Daniel from my co counsel Marianne Wang's office will also be \njoining us on the call. Also ,re =, my client who is flying in for victim services will be happy to speak with you, but I \nEFTA00032331\n\nhave a very tight schedule on Wednesday, because I need to be on a 1 or at the latest 2 P.M. train to D.C. that day. \nCould we have the meeting from noon to 1P.M.? My office is only one block away from the FBI meeting. \nGloria Allred \nAllred, Maroko & Goldberg \n6300 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1500 \nLos An eles CA 90048 \nwww.gloriaallred.com \n<image001.jpg> \n<image002.png> \nFrom: \n< \nSent: Monday, October 21, 2019 6:40 AM \nTo: Gloria \nAllred < \nCc: .
