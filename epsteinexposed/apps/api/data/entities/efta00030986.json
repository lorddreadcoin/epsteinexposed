We sent those over with the original message pad scans \nlast year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from \nthe NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. \nFBI file: We have that ready for you. \nCART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. \nEvidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This \nis the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, \nthat would be very helpful. \nIf it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well. \nEFTA00030986\n\nSpecial Agent \nFBI New York Field Office \nChild Exploitation/Human Trafficking \nC: \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 6:41 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n•ca \n(NY) \n(FBI) \n<a>: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: (EXTERNAL EMAIL) - RE: Discovery questions \nThanks so much, Really appreciate all the work you and are putting in on this.

We will be back in the office tomorrow and will dive into \nthis as best we can. We have several calls tomorrow, one of which is with Tony Figuero but well do our best to \nget on this list.

As I recall, there was a \nlarger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to \nprovide us with all of those scans this week? \nWith respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on \nthem and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 4:45 AM \nTo: \nCc: (NY) (FBI) <\n>; \nSubject: RE: Discovery questions \n(USANYS) \nSorry, got a bounceback for too.

I have some follow-up questions about the most recent \nbatch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. \nBelow are some questions regarding the discovery dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: \n• The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a  disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it \ncontains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? \n• The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think \nmentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those \ncopies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every \"Notebook\" pdf you provided in the \"Message pad \nscans\" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? \n• It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. \nWould you please get us copies of those returns? \nFollowing up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you \nplease be able to get us these this week? \n• Full FBI sentinel file \n• CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation \n• All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and \nhard copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. \n• Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials \n• Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been \nscanned, including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any \nnude or partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how \nmany such images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. \n• Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform \nfor review. Then please produce to SDNY a  copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude \nimages. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were \nlocated, where they were from, and where they are being stored. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nEFTA00030989\n\nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \n212-637-2324 \nEFTA00030990",
