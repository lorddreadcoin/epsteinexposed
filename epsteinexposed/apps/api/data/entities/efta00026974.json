I will do my best to ensure signature immediately. \nRe: this afternoon: it may be best to kick it to next week. If some time develops before 3, I'll let you know, but right \nnow it is iffy. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, January 31, 2020 12:21 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein -- travel approval form \nWe dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you —  we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA \napproval, but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final \nDOJ approval this afternoon. Thank you! \nAnd separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if \nthat's easier. \nthanks again, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00026976",
