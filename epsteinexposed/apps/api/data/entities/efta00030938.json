We have been \nwriting about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get \nBill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has \nEFTA00030938\n\nbeen the former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rod-Larsen, who resigned as president of the \nInternational Peace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching \nour translated articles. \nThe reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've \nheard that You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be \ngrateful if we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We \nhave reason to believe that both Mr. Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during \nChristmas to Epstein's island in the years 2010-2015. \nI'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website. \nHere are \nsome of our 40 articles: \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/intemational-peace-institute/terje-rod-larsen/jeffrey-epstein/norwegian-\nnewspaper-dn-reveals-diplomat-terje-rod-larsen-owed-jeffrey-epstein-130000/2-1-891702 \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/terje-rod-larsen/bill-gates/jeffrey-epstein/behind-the-scenes-how-jeffrey-epstein-\nhelped-billionaire-bill-gates-fund-un-affiliated-think-tank-projects/2-1-885697 \nhttps://www.dn.no/magasinet/dokumentar/jeffrey-epstein/thorbjom-jagland/terje-rod-larsen/bill-gates-and-\njeffrey-epstein-met-with-nobel-committee-chair/2-1-885834 \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/jeffrey-epstein/terje-rod-larsen/mona-juul/jeffrey-epstein-funded-special-\nperformance-of-tony-award-winning-play-for-the-un-community/2-1-918850 \nBest regards, \nTore Gjerstad \nPolitical reporter \nThe Norwegian Business Daily \nMobil: \nDagensNaffingsliv \nEFTA00030939",
