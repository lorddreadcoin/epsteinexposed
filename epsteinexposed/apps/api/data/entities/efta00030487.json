The two issues I wanted to follow up \nwith you about are below: \n• Maxwell is reporting that a  staff member \nnamed \no. was part of the group that included a \nCOVID positive individual but-is still working at the MDC. Would you please check on that for \nme? \n• Maxwell reported that a staff member entered her cell while she was inside it and took photographs of her cell \ntoday. Anything you can share with me about the purpose of that? \nMore generall indicated that she believes Maxwell's mental health is deteriorating significantly because of the \nconstant survei ance she is experiencing. She reports being awoken in the night by a light shining into her eyes multiple \ntimes a  night, being searched more frequently than other inmates, and having a camera constantly pointed at her in a way \nthat other inmates do not experience. Our office of course defers to BOP on decisions regarding what is necessary for \nsafety and security, but I wanted to pass along the concern. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nI  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York NY 10007 \nEFTA00030488",
