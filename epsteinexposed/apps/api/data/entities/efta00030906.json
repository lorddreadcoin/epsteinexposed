I agree it is better. \nI will make sure to do that moving forward. So far it has been easy to upload/not too large. \nFrom: \nSen \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: \nFW:delivery \no ar rive to MDC or iscovery pro uction to inmate \nCan I make a small suggestion on this? Unless and until it gets super inconvenient to do this in terms of upload time, I'd \nsuggest putting *all* the current discovery on whatever disk we send to the prison, like USAO_GM_000001 through \nwhatever is the latest production, and then having the facility send back whatever is the last disc we sent after the new \none arrives. \nThat way at any time there are only two disks out in the world with her discovery on them (the one she has at any given \ntime, and the one that's on its way to replace it), and only one in her possession at all times. Otherwise in two months \nshe's going to have a half dozen hard drives sitting in the MDC, with all different stuff on each one. But per usual anybody \nshould weigh in if anyone disagrees! \nFrom \nSent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 17:06 \nSubject: RE: delivery of hard drive to MDC for discovery production to inmate \nI just sent the next round of discovery via FedEx.

I have not received it yet, but \nit could just be that staff did not notify me a package arrived. Depending on the carrier, it could be in the warehouse or \nmailroom, so I just want to verify so I can find it expeditiously. \nThanks! \n8/5/2020 7:13 PM »> \nThat's extremely helpful, thanks so much. We'll plan to put the drive in the mail tomorrow, and of course please let us \nknow if any issues arise. \nthanks again, \nFrom \nSent: Wednesda Au ust 05 2020 19:05 \nu jec : e ivery o \niarc c ri\nve \no \nor c  iscovery pro \nuc ion o Mina e \nEFTA00030907\n\nHard drives should be mailed to the facility to the attention of the legal department. We need to etch the drive with a \nnumber and provide an authorization memo so she can retain it. Then it will be provided to her. It can be password \nprotected so long as you include a cover letter that contains the password for her. \nhelps, \n8/5/2020 4:34 PM >» \ne ave a ar rive wit oa ediscovery t  at we nee to ewer to islaine Maxwell, at MDC. Could \nyou please let us know what the current protocol is for that? Also, it's our understanding that hard drives with discovery \nmaterials for inmates needs to be non-encrypted (and not have a password for access), is that also correct? \nWe're hoping to get these materials to her tomorrow if at all possible, so we greatly appreciate your help.
