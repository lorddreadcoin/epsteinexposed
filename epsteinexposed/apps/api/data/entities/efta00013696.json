Since we have agreed to the date change, can you please confirm with Jay that this will not effect the date \nwhen Epstein begins serving his sentence?

It was great to catch up. \nFollowing up on our conversation about the date for Mr. \nEpstein's plea, where you said that you didn't want to \ndictate a schedule to the state, as we discussed I have \na case where I represent an individual who is now the \nlead witness for the government, and openings are set \nfor next week. Accordingly, I have now confirmed with \nMr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's \nattorney's office and the court will be available to \nhave him enter his plea on November 20. So we will \nplan to proceed on one that date. Please confirm that \nthis is ok. \nThanks, Jay \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
