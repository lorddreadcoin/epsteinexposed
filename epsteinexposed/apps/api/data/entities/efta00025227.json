The only way I could get the Epstein victim calls to you and the team was to have Outlook search for a certain \nstring in the subject that included my telephone. This was someone responding to a voice message I left earlier. The \nsubject of the email he received included my number. \n• \nFrom:\nSent: Thursday, September 26, 2019 1:10 PM \nTo: \nSubject: accidentally forwarding \nthink I might be getting your emails accidentally forwarded (along with the Epstein team). This happened a few \nweeks ago as well. No worries, but I wanted to let you know. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00025227",
