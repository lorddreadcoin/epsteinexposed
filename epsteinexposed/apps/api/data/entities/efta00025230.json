Unfortunately because of scheduling I expect I'll need to fly down and back both on Monday (and back \nin time to make an afternoon flight to Tennessee for a separate work obligation), but it's possible may need to go if \nwe can't get the scheduling. In any event, we're requesting approval for travel for one person for either zero nights or one \nnight, and no need for a conference room for this trip. \nthanks very much, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00025230",
