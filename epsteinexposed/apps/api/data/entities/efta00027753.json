Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nthe Silvio J. Mono Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York. New York 10007 \nOctober 15, 2021 \nUSDC SDNY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY \nFILED \nDOC \n0: \nDATE \nFILED: \n1 \nOn \n5/21 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated \nOctober 15, 2021 (Dkt. No. 348) ordering the Government to respond to the defendant's October \n14, 2021 letter regarding delivery of the defendant's legal mail at the Metropolitan Detention \nCenter \n(\"MDC\") (Dkt. No. 346). \nThe Government conferred with legal counsel at the MDC in response to the Court's Order \nand was informed of the following: As a general matter, legal mail from a defendant's counsel is \ndelivered to the defendant within one business day of receipt at the MDC. Legal mail sent to a \ndefendant from the Government via FedEx goes to the MDC's warehouse. Staff at the MDC's \nwarehouse process and log the mail in a tracking system and then contact the relevant \ndepartment—in this case, the legal department—about the mail. The legal department has to then \ngo to the warehouse to retrieve the mail, log the mail, assign the mail an internal number for \ntracking purposes, and fill out a  form authorizing the delivery of the mail to the inmate before \ndelivering the mail to the inmate. \nLegal counsel at the MDC has explained to the Government that these are the MDC's \nEFTA00027753\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 350 Filed 10/15/21 Page 2 of 3 \nPage 2 \nstandard procedures for legal mail, and these protocols apply to each one of the approximately \n1,700 inmates at the MDC. Legal counsel at the MDC has further explained that defense counsel's \nrequest that the MDC be ordered to provide the defendant with all legal mail within one day of \nreceipt by the MDC would be extremely burdensome and is not practicable in light of the various \nresponsibilities of the MDC's legal department, which is responsible for issues relating to the \napproximately 1,700 inmates at the MDC. The Government respectfully submits that there are no \ncircumstances that merit special expedited delivery for this defendant, and that the delivery of the \ndefendant's mail should not receive priority over the services the legal department's staff provides \nto other inmates. \nAs noted in the defense's letter, the Government sent a hard drive containing Court-ordered \ndisclosures to the defendant via FedEx on October 11, 2021. The hard drive was received by the \nMDC on October 12, 2021. Legal counsel at the MDC informed the Government that there was \nan institutional emergency impacting the safety and security of the MDC on October 13, 2021, \nsuch that no inmate at the MDC received any legal mail from the warehouse that day. On the \nmorning of October 14, 2021, legal counsel at the MDC personally delivered the hard drive to the \ndefendant. \nThe Government has made best efforts to obtain accurate information and respond to the \nCourt's Order within a short time frame. Should the Court have any questions or require any \nadditional details regarding this topic, the Government will confer with legal counsel at the MDC \nand provide additional information. \nEFTA00027754\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 350 Filed 10/15/21 Page 3 of 3 \nPage 3 \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: c/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nCc: Defense Counsel (By ECF) \nBased on the information in this letter, the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order. \nSee Dkt. No. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that a defendant in a pre-trial \nposture like Ms. Maxwell will in most circumstances receive legal mail within approximately \n1  business day. Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant may renew the request \nfor a specific order requiring delivery within that time frame. With this understanding and in \nlight of the unusually early pre-trial disclosure schedule set by the Court, the Court remains \nconfident that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys are fully able to prepare for trial. This resolves \nDkt. No. 346. SO ORDERED. \nOi \n10/15/21 \nEFTA00027755",
