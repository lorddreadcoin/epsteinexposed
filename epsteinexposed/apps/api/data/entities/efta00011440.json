He had been with me since I was 2. I am a little off balance as \nnot only has my office been restructured, I have left the RN and now my \nwhole life is in turmoil as I have no one to look after me. He was a real \nrock and almost a part of the family. \nIf you have any good ideas as to how to get my mind back on track I'd be \ngrateful for advice. \nSee you real soon... I hope if you are coming over. \nA xxx \n Original Message \nFrom: G. Maxwell (mailto:gmax1@mindspring.com) \nSent: 16 August 2001 16:32 \nTo: abx17@dial.pipex.com \nSubject: \nSo sorry to dissapoint you, however the truth must be told. I have only \nbeen able to find appropriate friends. Will let you know about some church \nmeetings on those dates \nKisses \nGx \nEFTA00011440",
