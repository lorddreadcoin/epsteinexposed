I'm a journalist with the UK's Daily Telegraph. \nIs it possible to say, on background, whether you want to question Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell [both \nBritish citizens...] \nThere is also a report in the New York Post that Ms Maxwell is \"cooperating with authorities\". Can you confirm, \non background, if that is true? \nMany thanks \nNick Allen \nWashington Editor \nThe Daily Telegraph \nCell \nThe contents of this message and any attachments to it are private, confidential and may be the subject of legal privilege.
