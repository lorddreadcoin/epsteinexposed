GHiSLAINE MAXWELL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER \n23, 2021 \nDate: The, 23 Nov 2021 13:24:13 +0000 \nImportance: High \nAttachments: 2021.11.01_Pseudonym_ruling_from_Transcript.pdf; \n2021.11.10_Pseudonym_logistics_order.pdf; 2021.11.18_Maxwet-\nSketch Artist Order.pdf \ninline-Images: \nimage001.png \nIn order meet the demand for the high volume of media requests we are already receiving, the following \nguidance is being provided in advance of the trial to ensure efficient communications. Please take careful note. \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nSouthern District of New York \nPRESS GUIDANCE \nTuesday, November 23, 2021 \n*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses \nwill be testifying  in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion \n[attached] requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged \nsensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which \nthey have been victims. I  believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex \ncrime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their \nprivacy. \n9:30 a.m. —  Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell —  the defendant is charged in connection to \nconspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity —  before Judge \nAlison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood \nMarshall U.S. \nCourthouse]). \nEXHIBITS: Government exhibits will be provided exclusively through the SDNY file share. If you are unable \nto access this link to the file share (USAFx), you must establish an account to access the files. To establish an \nEFTA00029582\n\naccount, request access by \nemail to me or my colleague, Jim Margolin, Cc'd here, prior to Wednesday, \nNovember 29, 2021. \nPlease also note that all case filings in U.S. v. Maxwell are available in the Court's electronic filing system; we \nencourage media representatives to establish a free PACER account, if they have not done so already. \nCredentialing and other matters relating to in-person attendance for the trial are handled by the SDNY District \nExecutive's Office. \nPeriodic updates to follow. \nFollow us on Facebook I  Follow us on Twitter I  SDNY website I  YouTube \n*** FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY *** \nDO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE.
