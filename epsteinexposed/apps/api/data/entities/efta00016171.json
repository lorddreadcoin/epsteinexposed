They asked whether we would file a Rule 35, and requested a \nmeeting to discuss it. I asked what had changed since we told them, on April 17, that we did not intend to file such a \nmotion. They said that Cohen \"has heard Trump say things about Epstein,\" but would not get into detail at this time \nabout what those were. They then attempted to rehash our April 17 conversation about Rule 35, and asked for specifics \nabout what Cohen had done to undermine his credibility. I said I would consider whether we were willing to provide \nmore specifics. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nEFTA00016171",
