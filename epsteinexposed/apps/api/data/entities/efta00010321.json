We understand that your client has declined to sit for a voluntary \ninterview and provide oral answers in real time to our office. Because the written statement you propose to provide will \nnot assist our investigation, we intend to move forward with our MLA request seeking a compelled interview of your \nclient. Accordingly, we plan to inform the UKCA that the parties are not able to reach agreement on a voluntary interview \nand that a voluntary interview will not occur. \nBest regards, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nISM \nFrom: \nGary Bloxsome \nSent: Wednesda , Se tember 16, 2020 2:52 AM \nTo: \nCc: , Daniel Cundy; Jennifer Richardson \nSubject: Re: Reference materials further to our call \nDeari \nI believe my response is clear. The Duke of York will provide a witness statement and will agree, following the provision of \nthat witness statement, to a voluntary written interview wherein he will answer any and all relevant questions of him as a \nwitness in writing about the full range of topics relevant to your ongoing investigation, including events not covered by \nthe currently pending indictment against Ghislaine Maxwell. If you want to ask any questions in person or via video rather \nthan in writing I am sure the Duke would be willing to receive your questions in that format before providing written \nanswers. \nKind regards \nGary \ngang RInvcrima I Partnar \n$ RANKED IN 6 \nChambers .• \n% \nUK \ndr, 299 0 V\nIS410,\niVadiall HMI \nLLBIL\n500 \nTUT TIER \n2020 \nCOVID-19 —  Please see our websiteherefor our updated position in relation to Coronavirus. \nEFTA00010321\n\nIn the meantime if you need to speak to one of our lawyers, please leave a voicemail by dialling 020 \n8686 6232 where we will respond to the messages in the order they are received or by emailing your \nenquiry to covidPblackfords.com \nBlackfords LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number 0C325398 at Hill House, 1 Mint Walk, \nCroydon, CRO lEA.

Whilst we appreciate that such an approach differs from what is \nstandard in the US, we do not consider such an approach would be unhelpful, or of no utility, to your case. Our client is \nwilling to provide you with a witness statement, addressing any issues that he may be able to,in relation to Ghislaine \nMaxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, his association with them and his knowledge of them such as may be relevant to the \nprosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. In addition - should you make written requests for clarification arising from that \nwitness statement - our client could provide written answers by way of a supplementary/addendum statement. Such \nan interaction could take place more than once if necessary. Providing written answers to either written questions or \nto questions previously put, is again a common practice in the UK. \nYou have invited us to identify any areas or subject topics which we would consider to be inappropriate or irrelevant to \nbe put to our client; we consider that questions put/topics raised should rightfully be limited to the indictment period \nin the current proceedings (i.e. US v Ghislaine Maxwell), being 1994-1997. \nWe are of course aware that you have requested a witness interview in your request to the UKCA and to ourselves; you \nhave confirmed to us however (in January this year, through your liaison officer immediately prior to our recent \nconferences, and then during our conferences) that you regard our client not as a witness but as a subject. We have \nventilated at some length our concerns regarding our client being interviewed in those circumstances and we consider \na witness statement and the offer of further engagement with written questioning to be a fair compromise and one \nwhich would be acceptable in the UK. \nTo move forward with the above approach, we would continue to require your assurance that the content of any such \nwitness statement and supplementary written responses be treated with the utmost confidentiality, not used for any \npurpose other than in relation to the criminal proceedings against Ms Maxwell, and not be shared with any parties \noutside of your department, including complainants and their representatives in your investigation and in civil matters \noutside of it. \nKind regards \nGary \nGary Bloxsome 'Partner \nCOVID-19 — Please see our websiteherefor our updated position in relation to Coronavirus. \nIn the meantime if you need to speak to one of our lawyers, please leave a voicemail by dialling 020 \n8686 6232 where we will respond to the messages in the order they are received or by emailing your \nenquiry to covid@blackfords.com \nBlackfords LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number 0C325398 at Hill House, 1 Mint Walk, \nCroydon, CRO lEA.
