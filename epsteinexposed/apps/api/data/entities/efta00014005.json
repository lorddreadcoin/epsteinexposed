In it, you ask whether Mr. Epstein \"intends to fully \nabide by the Non-Prosecution Agreement.\" The answer is yes. \nWe confirm as \nyou state in your \nletter \nthat \nthe Agreement requires \nthat \"the \nfederal \nGrand Jury \ninvestigation will \nremain suspended, and all pending federal \nGrand Jury subpoenas will be held \nin abeyance \nunless and until \n[Mr. \nEpstein] violates any term of [the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement].\" \nWe also confirm that under the Agreement, \n\"prosecution in this District for these \noffenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution \nby the State of Florida, provided that Epstein \nabides by the . conditions and the \nrequirements of th[e] Agreement.\" \nAs \nyou \nknow, there is no \nprovision in the Agreement refening \nin any way to Section \n3509(k). \nBy \nthat statute, Congress imposed a  mandatory obligation on \nfederal \ndistrict courts to stay \ncertain civil cases. Its \noperation is not \nsubject to the \ncontrol or discretion \nof any party. Whether \nTitle 18, United \nStates Code, Section 3509(k) applies \nto this civil litigation is a question of law \nfor resolution by Judge Marra. Accordingly, we are abiding by our ethical obligation to advise \nthe Court of its statutory \nmandate under Section 3509(k). \nFinally, thank you for notifying me \nthat our motion to quash teclmically \nremains outstanding. \nWe had \npreviously \nnotified the Court \nthat the parties \ndid not wish \nto argue \nthe issue. I agree that \nthe Agreement requires its withdrawal and we will file a formal notice withdrawing it this week. \nPlease do not \nhesitate to call me if you wish further \nclarification of our position or to discuss this \nmatter in any way. Until then, I remain, \nVery \ntruly yours, \n• \nMichael \nR. rein \n• \ncc: Jack \nGoldberger, Esq. \nRoy \nBlack, Esq. \nAlex Acosta, Esq. \n303110HAND AVENUE \n• \nEU ITC \n3A0 • \nCOCONUT \nGROVE, FLORIDA33133 \nTELEPHONE \n(303) 44E-1101 • \nrakes' ILC \n(303) 442.6744 \n• TNAT.LCWISTEIN.COM \nThis tax was sent with GFI FAXmaker tax server.
