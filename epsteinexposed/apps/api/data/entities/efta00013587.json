Australian \nAve, Ste 400 \nsat\nFL \n33401 \nFacsimile: \nAugust 26, 2008 \nDELIVERY BY \nELECTRONIC MAIL \nJay P. \nLefkowitz, Esq. \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nCitigroup Center \n153 East 53rd Street \nNew York, New \nYork 10022-4675 \nRoy \nBlack, Esq. \nBlack \nSrebnick Kornspan & \nStumpf P.A. \n201 S. \nBiscayne Blvd, Suite 1300 \nMiami, \nFL 33131 \nRe: Jeffrey \nEpstein \nDear Jay \nand Roy: \nThank you for your letter of August \n22nd. I write to follow up on some of the \npoints \nthat you raised. \nThe list of thirty-two victims that was \nprovided to Mr. Goldberger via certified mail \non July \n10, 2008 is the final list. As I \nmentioned, copies of the notification letters to \neach \nvictim will be \ncarbon-copied to an attorney for Mr. Epstein and Mr. \nJosefsberg. I asked you \nto \nadvise me whether Mr. Goldberger should \ncontinue to be listed as the contact person \nfor \nthe civil litigation in the amended victim \nnotification letters and whether he should receive \nthe \ncarbon copies of those \nletters as they are \nsent. \nI also asked you to provide me with \nwritten confirmation of your agreement to pay Mr. \nJosefsberg's fees. Please provide \nthat confirmation to Mr. Josefsberg so that he can \nbegin \nhis representation, and \nprovide me with a copy for my file. \nI have conferred with the lead \nAUSA in the case of Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States, \nEFTA00013587\n\nJAY P. \nLEFKOwITZ, ESQ. \nROY \nBLACK, \nESQ. \nAucurr \n26, 2008 \nPAGE 2 OF 2 \nand he agrees that, \nbased upon the discussion \nwith Judge Marra \nduring the hearing on the \nplaintiffs' \nmotion, a notification of the judge's \nruling is required. I  will, \nhowever, change \nthe language \nslightly to direct the victims \nto discuss the matter \nwith Mr. Josefsberg. \nWith \nregard to your concerns with \nmy \"open-ended \ndescription of Mr. Epstein's \nresponsibilities regarding civil restitution,\" I \nagree that the resolution of civil damages \nclaims \nis as stated \nin paragraphs 7  and 8 of \nthe Agreement and \nAddendum. That is why the \nlanguage in the notification is \ntaken verbatim from paragraphs 7, 8, and \n7C of the Agreement \nand \nAddendum, except that the \nvictim's name is used in place \nof \"identified individual.\" \nAs \nI mentioned \nin my earlier letter, \nifyou have any proposed substantive \nchanges, please provide \nthem to me. \nMr. \nGoldberger and Mr. Tein explicitly \napproved the language in my earlier \nvictim \nnotification letter, even \nthough they apparently \nwere taking the position that \nthe December \n19, 2007 \nletter was not part of the \nAgreement, so that misinformation was provided \nto the \nvictims with the \napproval of Mr. Epstein's \nattorneys. \nWith \nregard to your sixth and \nseventh points. I reiterate that \nit is the Office's position \nthat \nthe Agreement and Addendum speak \nfor themselves. Let me also reiterate \nthat, while \nthe \nOffice does not intend to involve \nitself in any civil \nnegotiations or litigation, if it \ncomes \nto our attention that Mr. Epstein has \nbreached the terms of the Agreement, the \nOffice intends \nto \nenforce its right \npursuant to the Agreement. \nI \nwould appreciate a prompt response to \nthe question regarding which of Mr. \nEpstein's \nattorneys should be named in and \nreceive copies of the notification letters, as \nwell as \ndocumentation of your commitment to \npaying Mr. Josefsberg's fees so that I \nmay begin \ndistributing the revised victim \nnotifications on Wednesday morning. \nSincerely, \ncc: \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited \nStates Attome \nBy: \nssi n ni \nChief, Northern Division \nEFTA00013588",
