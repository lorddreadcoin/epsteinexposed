I didn't have comments. And agree with the below. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Monday, October 18, 2021 4:34 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Revised MILs and letters \nHere are a few comments on the motion. I looked at the two letters also, and have one suggestion on each (I'm happy to \npropose language in redline, but you may be in the dots) \n1. On the \"key\" letter —  would it be possible to include a sentence on pointing to Judge Nathan to whatever \nthe article(s) in which she has made comments about Epstein that are far more limited than what she will say in \ncourt? \n2. On the sealing letter — I think we should add a sentence explaining why we think the claim of Maxwell abuse will \ncause prejudicial publicity. Namely, to air that issue in a public filing when there may well be no good faith basis for \nit would potentially taint the jury pool. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, October 18, 2021 3:46 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \n) C as; \nSubject: Revised MILs and letters \nHi and \nAttached for your review are: \n1.
