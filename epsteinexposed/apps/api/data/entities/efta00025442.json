(NY) (FBI) <\nM>; \nI have a recollection that when we were interviewing employees at the MCC, one or more individuals told us there was \na sign posted in the SHU that said to do your checks on Epstein. If memory serves, we never recovered the document. \nBut last week we got a production of records from the BOP as part of FOIA litigation that included the attached. Can \nyou remind us (a) if there was in fact some employee who told us about this sign — I haven't looked at all the 302s and \nMOls, and (b) of anything we did to try to get this sign previously (if we did in fact make inquiries). \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew \nYork, New York 10007 \nTel: \nCell: \nEFTA00025442",
