For this case, we have a \nwitness coming in for trial prep this week. is going to conduct a mock cross examination of her. In order to help him \nprep for that, could you please put together a binder of the 302s of her interviews? can point you to the \nfolder on the shared where all of that lives (things have been moving around a bit as we prep to produce 3500). The \nwitness is (that's her married name — she used to be so some documents are titled that \nway). \nIf you're able to get that to IM by tomorrow morning, that would be great. Thanks! \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00027579\n\nIM) \nEFTA00027580",
