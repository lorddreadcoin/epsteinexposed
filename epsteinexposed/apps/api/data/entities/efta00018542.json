Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a massage? \nA: I have not given anyone a massage. \nCI: You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony? \nA: That is my testimony. \nCI: \nYou never gave a massage is your testimony? \nA: I never gave a massage. \n<clip I.MOV> \nEFTA00018542",
