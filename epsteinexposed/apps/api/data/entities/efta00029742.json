They had a conference call with Inspector \nGeneral this morning, who dictated that they start the report on the case. The report will include \neverything from the time of Epstein's admission to the MCC up to the time of his death. in DC is the \nattorney assigned to the report. The first issue under examination is why Epstein was not given a new cellmate \nfollowing Reyes's departure—a draft of this section of the report is expected to be completed by the end of this week. \nThey will be starting with the materials from the criminal investigation. If they need to do additional fact finding, they \nwill be in touch with us before doing so. There is no deadline yet for the completion of the report, which will likely \nbecome public. \nIt likely makes sense to have a brief discussion. In the email below, OIG requested our position on the investigation, but \nknow if we have provided one yet.

I have been asked to share this with the investigative and prosecution team for opinion and \nconsideration. I requested that the BOP provide us with some specific information and details about what this would \ninclude and we were provided with the below information and attached Program Statement. Can you all please review \nEFTA00029744\n\nthis information and then can one representative from the FBI and one representative from the U.S. Attorney's Office, \nSDNY, let us know your office's position regarding this matter? I have included SAIMand ASACof \nour Operations Branch I (OPS I) in this email as they deal directly with the BOP HQ.

Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, \nreview camera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a misconduct investigation. \nShould the Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent \nwith normal misconduct reporting requirements. \nWe are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise \nconnected to the criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if \nyou  additional questions or would like to discuss.
