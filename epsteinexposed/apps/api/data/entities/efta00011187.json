I, served for 25 years in the United Kingdom military. For 15 of those years, I \nserved in the United Kingdom Special Forces. I have worked in the security industry for ten \nyears and have gained a level 6 Security Risk Management Consultants (SRMC) qualification, \nworking towards a master's degree in Risk Management. I hold numerous instructional and \noperational licenses qualifying me to deliver several types of security services under the UK \nSecurity Industry Authority, including a certification to provide close protection services for \nindividuals facing physical threats. I am a member of the Academy of Security Intelligence and \nRisk Studies and have owned and operated security companies in all capacities in a number of \ndifferent \ncountries. \n2. As part of my security portfolio, I have secured global assets and have protected numerous high \nvalue persons. As an example, I was contracted to guard the UKs third richest person, \naccording to Forbes, after he broke his agreed bail conditions with another consultant. Under \nmy protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to \ncessation. \n3. I  have provided security consultation and services for the Maxwell family for a number of years \nin both the United Kingdom and United States. I provided security services for Ghislaine \nMaxwell from approximately July 2019 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2020. \n4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a \nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 20 years \npreviously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were \ntrying to achieve a `scoop.' This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life \nthreatening. A good example is the case of Princess Diana, who unfortunately lost her life due to \nEFTA00011188\n\nSparta Security Services \nSparta Security Services Ltd \nBarrington House \nHereford \nHR4 \nOBQ \nVd w wscuuitybysparta.com \npress intrusion into her personal space. My consultants conduct meticulous planning and \npreparation to avoid such instances. \n5. After the announcement of Epstein's death on the 10th August 2019, my risk assessment showed \nthat Ghislaine Maxwell was at substantial risk. It was therefore paramount for her safety that we \nimplement certain security protocols, which we did. \n6. On the morning of July 2, 2020, my operative/consultant was providing \nsecurity and administrative support for Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell at a residence in Bradford, New \nHampshire. He had been assigned to Ms. Maxwell since approximately May 2020. I had \ninformed that Ms. Maxwell needed security because she was being harassed by the press \nand had been the target of physical threats by unknown third parties. \n7. was on duty alone on the morning of July 2, 2020. He called me twice after being \ndisturbed at approximately 6:30am. He had heard and noticed a helicopter flying above the \ngeneral area of the property. He assumed it was members of the press. He telephoned me and \ninformed me of the situation. At this stage, we believed the press had discovered the property. I \ninstructed that Ms. Maxwell be informed and she should be prepared to move into a safe room if \nany perimeters were breached. \n8. At approximately 8:30am, noticed and subsequently reported to me that vehicles were \ncoming up the driveway and that he had approached the vehicles to check what was happening. \n9. again assumed it was members of the press. He reported to me that he called Ms. \nMaxwell on the radio to alert her that the press was on the grounds and approaching the house. \n10. There was an established security protocol in place that Ms. Maxwell was to follow in the event \nthat her security was threatened while she was inside the house. This protocol was \ncommunicated to when he was assigned to Ms. Maxwell, and he had reviewed it \nwith Ms. Maxwell when he started. \nEFTA00011189\n\nSparta Security Services \nSparta Security Services Ltd \nBerrington House \nHereford \nHR4 0BO \niLybysparta.com \n11. According to the protocol, Ms. Maxwell was to move away from the windows, if possible, and \nmove into a safe room inside the house. This is normal protocol in these situations. A safe room \ntypically has water, food and communications. It is also able to be locked and barricaded from \nthe inside to ensure it gives enough time for a 911 call to be placed and the police to arrive \nbefore exposure to the threat. \n12. reported to me immediately after Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. He confirmed to me that \nafter radioing Ms. Maxwell, one or two vehicles pulled up and stopped near where was \nstanding. He was told to stop and move no further by a number of individuals who got out of \nthe vehicles. At that time, he could see that they were federal agents because they were wearing \nFBI jackets and had weapons visible. The agents physically searched and \nquestioned \nhim. \n13. was later taken to a vehicle where Ms. Maxwell was sitting. She asked him if he would \nlook after the dogs and the cat, which he agreed to do. \n14.1 understand that, as part of her renewed bail application, Ms. Maxwell is proposing a \nsubstantial bail package that will include the following conditions, among others: (i) Ms. \nMaxwell will surrender all of her travel documents, and (ii) she will be subject to home \nconfinement with electronic GPS monitoring. I also understand that, upon release, Ms. \nMaxwell will be monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by our security teams. \n15. In light of the proposed bail package and the strict conditions of her confinement post-release, \nas well as our long-standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, my company will be posting a $1 \nmillion bond in support of her bail application. \n16.1 have never once posted a bond for a client in the past. I  am happy to post a bond for Ms. \nMaxwell in light of the factors discussed above and my relationship with her, because I am \nconfident that she will not try to flee. \nEFTA00011190\n\nSparta Security Services \nSparta Security Services Ltd \nBarrington \nHouse \nHereford \nHR4 \nOBQ \niLybysparta.com \nAll of the above is true and to the best of my knowledge \nSigned: \n'94 \n25/11/2020 \nEFTA00011191",
