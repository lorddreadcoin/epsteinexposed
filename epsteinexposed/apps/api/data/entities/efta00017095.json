Karas \nUnited States District Judge \nThe Hon. Charles L. Brieant Jr. \nFederal Buildin and United States Courthouse \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nRe: United States v.  Tartaglione, 16-cr-832 — Unsealing of Judicial Records \nDear Judge Karas: \nI  write on behalf of The New York Times Company and reporter Benjamin \nWeiser (jointly, \"The Times\") regarding the Government's application to seal \ntwo recent filings in this case. The Times agrees with the New York Post and the \nDaily Netts (see Dkt. 155) that the application has no merit: the filings are \njudicial documents subject to the common law and First Amendment rights of \naccess, and the high bar required for overcoming these rights has not been met.' \nThe Government has sought to seal records related to Mr. Tartaglione's August \n20, 2019 application to \"be moved from the [Metropolitan Correctional Center] \nand detained at another facility.\" Dkt. 147 at 1. As the basis for his application, \nMr. Tartaglione's counsel cited the \"constant and deplorable\" conditions at the \nMCC and perceived threats to his client's safety from MCC guards. Id. at 2. \nThose threats, he says, arise from his client's speaking up about both the \nconditions at MCC and the attempted suicide of his former and now-late cellmate \nJeffrey Epstein. Id. at 1-2. The Government submitted a sealed response to the \napplication on August 23; Mr. Tartaglione responded in turn, also in a sealed \nThe right of access is an affirmative, enforceable public right, and the \nstanding of the press to enforce it is well settled. See, e.g., Globe Newspaper Co. \nv. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982); Hanford Courant Co. v. \nPellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir. 2004). \nEFTA00017095\n\nfiling, on August 28. See Dkt. 152. On August 29, the Government belatedly \nfiled applications to seal both documents. Dkts. 151, 152. The Government \ncontends that the documents are not judicial documents subject to the right of \naccess and that even if they were certain portions of each document should be \nredacted. See Dkts. 151, 152. \nFor reasons stated by the Post and Daily News, the Government is wrong on both \ncounts. Under the Second Circuit's access jurisprudence, a \"judicial document\" is \nan item \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the \njudicial process.\" United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). A \ncommon law presumption of access attaches to any judicial document, and an \nadditional First Amendment right arises where public access to a document has \nbeen historically available (the \"experience\" prong) and would be valuable to the \nprocess in question (the \"logic\" prong). Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, \n435 F.3d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2006). The weight of the common law \npresumption turns on \"the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article \nIII judicial power\" and \"the resultant value of such information to those \nmonitoring the federal courts.\" Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & \nGrossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 142 (2d Cir. 2016) (citation and internal marks \nomitted). Once the right of access attaches, it is overcome only by \n\"countervailing factors\" (under the common law) or specific, on-the-record \nfindings that sealing \"is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly \ntailored to serve that interest\" (under the First Amendment). Id. at 143-45 \n(citations and internal marks omitted). \nThe Government contends that the papers filed in connection with Mr. \nTartaglione's transfer application are not judicial documents because they have \n\"no bearing on the charges contained in the pending indictment\" and instead \naddress a matter \"ancillary to his criminal prosecution.\"2 Dkt. 151 at 1. Not so. \nAs an initial matter, what makes a record a \"judicial document\" is not whether it \n\"directly affect[s]\" a criminal prosecution, id. at 2, but what role it plays in the \nperformance of a judicial function. Applying this standard, the courts have found \nthe right of access to reach a wide range of records in criminal proceedings. See, \ne.g., United States v. Suarez, 880 F.2d 626, 630-31 (2d Cir. 1989) (First \nAmendment right of access to forms used for payments to court-appointed \ncounsel); United States v.  Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 151-53 (2d Cir. 2001) \n(common law right attaches to audio and video tapes played at pretrial detention \nhearing); Applications of National Broadcasting Co., 828 F.2d 340, 344-45 (6th \n2 \nThough the Government articulated this reason only in its application to \nseal its own filing, its position on Mr. Tartaglione's filing is presumably based on \nthe same reasoning. \n2 \nEFTA00017096\n\nCir. 1987) (First Amendment right of access to records related to motions for \ndisqualification of judge and for inquiry into attorney conflicts of interest). \nThe filings sought to be sealed here easily meet the standard for judicial \ndocuments. In seeking a \"court order\" for his transfer from MCC, Dkt. 147 at I, \nMr. Tartaglione expressly called upon the Court to exercise its adjudicatory \npower over a matter within its purview. Though the Government characterizes its \nresponse to the application as nothing more than a \"status report,\" Dkt. 151 at 2, \nits filing and Mr. Tartaglione's response both pertained to the application and \nwere directed at guiding the Court's resolution of it.3 That makes them judicial \ndocuments. \nWhat's more, the weight of the common law presumption of access to these \nrecords is undeniably strong. In Graham, the Second Circuit found that the \npresumption of access for tapes played at a pretrial detention hearing was, at a \nminimum, \"substantial\": \"The detention of criminal defendants pending trial is a \nquintessential exercise of a court's Article III judicial power, and the public has a \nlegitimate interest monitoring a court's use of that power.\" 257 F.3d at 154. So \ntoo, here. Adjudicating a defendant's grievances about his pretrial confinement, \nwhich has apparently impacted the exercise of his constitutional rights, are \nmatters at the heart of the judicial function. And the public has a considerable \ninterest in monitoring how the court discharges that function. Perhaps more than \nanything, the public's confidence in the judiciary depends on openness of court \nrecords and proceedings. On this point, Chief Justice Burger's words in \nRichmond Newspapers v.  Virginia are particularly apt: \nPeople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their \ninstitutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited \nfrom observing. When a criminal trial is conducted in the open, there is \nat least an opportunity both for understanding the system in general and \nits workings in a particular case. \nThis is true regardless of the merits of Mr. Tartaglione's application. \nThe Government asserts that \"[a] pre-trial detainee does not have the right to be \nhoused at the facility of his choice.\" Dkt. 151 at 2 (citation and internal marks \nomitted). The Times does not take the Government to be arguing that the \nconditions of Mr. Tartaglione's confinement or his personal safety are entirely \noutside the Court's purview or that the Court is without any power whatsoever to \naddress those matters. \n3 \nEFTA00017097\n\n448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980) (plurality opinion).4\nThe seriousness of Mr. Tartaglione's alleged grievances here bear emphasis, too. \nAs the Post and Daily News point out, the conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's \nconfinement \"relate to his ability to prepare for trial and present an adequate \ndefense.\" Dkt. 155 at 1. His attorney claims that his client's opportunities to \nreview legal documents have been limited, and that members of the legal team \nhave sometimes waited \"hours\" to see him. Dkt. 147 at 1. Whether \n\"direct0\" \nor \nnot, Dkt. 151 at 2, the impact of a transfer on Mr. Tartaglione's prosecution is \npotentially significant. \nOn the question of whether the access right is overcome, the Government's \narguments again fall short. It says that portions of Mr. Tartaglione's filing \n\"restate the internal deliberations of the BOP\" and that their disclosure would \njeopardize the agency's \"law enforcement functions and internal deliberative \nprocesses.\" Dkt. 152. It elaborates on these points in its application to seal its \nown filing. See Dkt. 151 at 3 (disclosing considerations that inform BOP \ndecisionmaking would hamper candid communications and cause \"inmates to \nalter their behavior and manipulate their housing assignments\"). \nThough obviously not privy to these portions of the filings, The Times is \nskeptical that disclosure would cause the parade of horribles described by BOP. \nBOP suggests that the deliberative material in its filing would be exempt from \ndisclosure under Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act. Id. at 3. To \nbegin with, FOIA — a right of access created solely by statute —  has no bearing on \nthe common law or constitutional right of access. FOIA, by its terms, does not \napply to the judiciary, and public access to judicial documents is premised on the \n4  Both prongs of the First Amendment analysis are met, too: there is a \nhistory of public access to proceedings related to conditions of confinement, and \nopenness of those proceedings and records would undoubtedly enhance the \nfunctioning of the process. \nCf., \ne.g., Newman v.  Graddiek, 696 F.2d 796, 801 \n(11th Cir. 1983) (right of access to civil trials pertaining to confinement \nconditions); Graham, 257 F.3d at 154 (\"The bail decision is one of major \nimportance to the administration of justice, and openness will help to assure the \npublic that the decision is properly reached.\") (quoting In re Globe Newspaper \nCo., 729 F.2d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 1984) (internal marks omitted)). And even if there \nwere no history of openness, the mere \"logic\" of public access is a sufficient \nbasis for the First Amendment right. See, e.g., Suarez, 880 F.2d at 631; United \nStates v. Index Newspapers LLC, 766 F.3d 1072, 1094 (9th Cir. 2014) (\"logic \nalone, even without experience, may be enough to establish the [First \nAmendment] right\") (citation and internal marks omitted). \n4 \nEFTA00017098\n\npublic's historic need to monitor the functioning of the courts. See, e.g., Eil v. \nU.S. \nDrug Enforcement Admin., 878 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2017). \nEven were that not so, and FOIA were relevant (it is not), there is no reason to \nthink that the information contained in the BOP filing is genuinely deliberative,5\nor that the Government could show — as access jurisprudence requires it to —  that \ndisclosure poses some credible risk of harm. See, e.g., Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 143 \n(finding that disclosure would not \"reveal details of an ongoing investigation, \npose a risk to witnesses, endanger national security, or reveal trade secrets\"). It \nseems unlikely that publicly disclosing the factors that BOP considered in \ndeciding whether to transfer Mr. Tartaglione —  matters that BOP was comfortable \ndisclosing to Mr. Tartaglione himself and to this Court —  would actually have a \nchilling effect on agency deliberations. \nNor is there serious reason to think that inmates, armed with this new \ninformation, would succeed in any effort to \"manipulate their housing \nassignments.\" Setting aside the question of whether, as a general matter, inmates \nshould be kept in the dark about the reasons for their assignment to a given \nfacility, BOP has made clear that Mr. Tartaglione's case is \"exceptional.\" Dkt. \n151 at 3. Inmates \"seeking to take advantage of similar accommodations,\" id., \nwould be on notice of that fact. And even if some inmates cynically tried to \nobtain those accommodations, The Times trusts that BOP, with its substantial \nexpertise and experience in these matters, would see through those efforts. In \nshort, BOP's proffered basis for sealing does not meet the high burden imposed \nby the common law, particularly in the face of a weighty presumption of access.6\nSee, e.g., Graham, 257 F.3d at 154-55; Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 143-44. \nOn a final note, the immense public interest in these proceedings is worth \nhighlighting. Even before Mr. Tartaglione became Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate, \nthere was substantial public attention on his case because of the nature of the \n$ \nThe deliberative process privilege in Exemption 5 is limited to material \nthat is both \"predecisional,\" i.e., \"prepared in order to assist an agency \ndecisionmaker in arriving at his decision,\" and \"deliberative,\" i.e., \"actually \nrelated to the process by which policies are formulated.\" Hopkins v. \nU.S. \nDep't of \nNous. \n& \nUrban Dev., 929 F.2d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 1991) (citations, alteration, and \ninternal marks omitted). \n6  Because the basis for sealing is insufficient to overcome the common \nlaw right of access, it also necessarily cannot defeat the First Amendment right. \nSee Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124. \n5 \nEFTA00017099\n\ncharges against him and the prosecutors' \ndecision to seek the death penalty.? Mr. \nEpstein's attempted suicide, which occurred while Mr. Tartaglione was his \ncellmate, roused even greater interest in his case! Put simply, the public is \nwatching this case. The public is aware of Mr. Tartaglione's claims that BOP \ncorrectional officers have sought to silence him.9 The irony of the Government's \nefforts to keep records regarding those \nclaims out of public view is surely not lost \non \nit. \nWe thank the Court for \nits consideration. \nRespectfully submitted, \n£  L \nDavid \nE.
