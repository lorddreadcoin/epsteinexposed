At this point, I  have not received confirmation that the change of plea is going to occur, nor have I \nreceived information confirming that \nthe \nlea will be in conformance with our agreement. As such, at this \ntime, I still intend to \npresent Ms. \ntestimony to the grand jury on Tuesday. With respect to the \nimmunity question, I refer you to my e-mail of \nJune \n23rd, which is shown below. \nIf the situation changes, I will contact you. \nThank you. \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \n500 S.

Since this would seem to obviate any need for Ms. to testify, please let me know what is going on \nwith respect to this Tuesday. Do we still need to come down there and, if so, will she receive court-ordered immunity? \nThanks. \nBrendan White \n— Original Message ---\nFrom: \nTo: Brendan White \nSent: Monday, June 23, 2008 2:09 PM \nSubject: RE: Grand Jury Appearance \n. \n(USAFLS) \nEFTA00014140\n\nDear Mr. White: \nPlease feel free to make your own travel arrangements, but if you would like Ms. travel costs \nto be \nreimbursed, they must be made through the government's approved agency on the approved carriers. \nRegarding the immunity, at this point, without a written proffer from you regarding the substance of her \nanticipated testimony, I  believe that the more prudent course will be to question Ms. to determine the \nlimits of her Fifth Amendment exposure and, if necessary, to apply to the Court at that time. If you provide \nme with a written proffer that summarizes her anticipated testimony and explains how she will be exposed to \ncriminal liability, then I can make the motion ahead of time. Your written statement would be treated as an \nattorney statement made in the course of confidential plea discussions and related negotiations, and would be \ngoverned by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(0 and Fed. R. Evid. 410. \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \n500 S.
