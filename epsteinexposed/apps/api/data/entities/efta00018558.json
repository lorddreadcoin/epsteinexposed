Those documents may be covered by the attached protective order, and so we have asked \nwho is firewall counsel in Tartaglione, to receive the documents from you for potential production to defense counsel \n(so that and I do not see them). is going to review the protective order first and determine whether \nshe needs Judge Karas to modify the order to allow her to receive the documents, so please don't send them to \nuntil she reaches out. Thanks for helping with this — we know it is a pain. \nDeputy Chief, White Plains Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, New York 10601 \nTel: \nCell: \nEFTA00018558",
