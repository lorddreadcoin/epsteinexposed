Judge Says \nDate: Fri, 22 Feb 2019 13:12:28 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nclose \nProsecutors Broke Law In Epstein Plea Deal, Fla. Judge Says \nBy Carolina Bolado \nShare us on: \nLaw360 (February 21, 2019, 5:58 PM EST) --\nProsecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney and current \nLabor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the \nCrime Victims' Rights Act when they signed a non-\nprosecution agreement with billionaire sex offender \nJeffrey Epstein without notifying his victims, a \nFlorida federal judge ruled Thursday. \nProsecutors failed to comply with their obligations to \ninform the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, shown in 2004, \nthat they intended to enter into an agreement not to \nprosecute him, a judge said Thursday. (Getty) \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted \nsummary judgment to two Epstein victims who sued \nthe government over the deal and said federal \nprosecutors failed to comply with their obligations \nunder the CVRA to inform Epstein's victims that they \nintended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute \nhim. \nThe government's decision to hide its intentions and \nto tell victims to just be patient with the investigation \nwas \"particularly problematic,\" according to the \njudge. \nEFTA00032506\n\n\"When the government gives information to victims, \nit cannot be misleading,\" Judge Marra said. \"While \nthe government spent untold hours negotiating the \nterms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's \nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims. \nInstead, the victims were told to be 'patient' while the \ninvestigation proceeded.\" \nJudge Marra rejected the government's claim that the \nCVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea \nbargain or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of \nwhich are more common than a non-prosecution \nagreement, according to the opinion. But that reading \nof the law is \"inconsistent with the goal of the \nCVRA,\" the judge said. \n\"The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to \nonly one interpretation; namely, that victims should \nbe notified of significant events resulting in \nresolution of their case without a trial,\" Judge Marra \nsaid. \nThe ruling is a big win for the two Epstein victims, \nlisted as Jane Does, who sued the government in \n2008 alleging the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of Florida violated the CVRA with \nthe Epstein deal. \nThe CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, \nincluding the right to be informed of public court \nproceedings and not to be excluded from those \nproceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative \nreport published late last year, printed emails \nshowing that the alleged victims were deliberately \nexcluded from the deal cut between Acosta, who was \nthen the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of \nFlorida, and Epstein's defense team. \nEpstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens \n— claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, \nFlorida, mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have \nEFTA00032507\n\nnot had the opportunity to testify in court in any \nproceeding thus far, according to the Herald report. \nBradley Edwards, who represents the victims suing \nthe government, called Judge Marra's decision a \n\"clear victory and long-overdue vindication for all of \nthe \nvictims.\" \n\"It is unfortunate that at no time during the past 10 \nyears has the government acknowledged its clear \nviolation of the rights of dozens of crime victims,\" \nEdwards said. \"Hopefully now they will stop \ndefending what was clearly an improper agreement, \napologize directly and unequivocally, and work to \nmake it right.\" \nJudge Marra said the parties have 15 days to tell the \ncourt how they wish to proceed to determine any \nappropriate remedies. Edwards said the primary \nremedy is the invalidation of the non-prosecution \nagreement. \nA U.S. Department of Labor spokeswoman said the \nactions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in this case \n\"have been defended by the Department of Justice in \nlitigation across three administrations and several \nattorneys general.\" She said any further comment \nwould have to come from the DOJ. \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District \nof Florida declined to comment. \nThe DOJ has opened an investigation into whether its \nattorneys engaged in misconduct when negotiating \nthe controversial deal with Epstein, according to a \nletter sent earlier this month to Sen. Ben Sasse, R-\nNeb., who repeatedly pushed for such an \ninvestigation. The letter said the DOJ's Office of \nProfessional Responsibility had opened an \ninvestigation into the deal. \nEFTA00032508\n\nIt was after reading the investigative report by the \nHerald that Sasse became concerned and sent two \nletters to the DOJ urging the agency to investigate. \nThe Herald's three-part series, \"Perversion of \nJustice,\" showed how Acosta and other DOJ \nattorneys worked closely with defense lawyers to \ncraft a lenient plea deal for Epstein in 2008. \nThe series was published just before Epstein was set \nto go to trial in a civil dispute with Edwards, who had \nfiled a malicious prosecution claim against Epstein. \nThe trial was to have featured testimony from some \nof his victims. But just before jury selection was set \nto begin, an attorney for Edwards announced a \nsettlement, while Epstein's attorney read an apology \nfrom his client to Edwards. \nThe victims are represented by Bradley Edwards \nof Edwards Pottinger LLC, Jay C. Howell of Jay \nHowell & \nAssociates PA, John Scarola of Searcy \nDenney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley PA and Paul G. \nCassell of the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney \nCollege of Law. \nThe government is represented by Ann Marie C. \nVillafana and Dexter Lee of the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of Florida. \nThe case is Doe et al. v. U.S., case number 9:08-cv-\n80736, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida. \n--Additional reporting by Lauren Berg. Editing by \nNicole Bleier. \nEFTA00032509",
