I have been wondering the same thing. Here is the term sheet and guidelines \ncalculation that we provided at the last meeting. You and and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to \nan Information charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I  think must have \nasked Alex about it and it was nixed. Just to be prepared for tomorrow, I  was just starting to draft a Rule 11 plea \nagreement in case Alex changes his mind and a  formal non-prosecution agreement containing the state plea \nterms. As soon as those are ready, I  will e-mail them to you. \n<Con? Plea Negotiations final.wpd>> \nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow. First, that there is an absolute drop-dead date for \naccepting or rejecting because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of September, which \nmeans presenting the indictment on September 25th.  Second, the agents and I have not reached out to the \nvictims to get their approval, which as politely reminded me, is required under the law. And third, I  do not \nwant to make any promises about allowing Epstein to self-surrender because I  still believe that we have a good \nchance of getting him detained. \nOn another note, Junior got a call today from the Palm Beach Police Chief because he got information that there \nwill be an article released tomorrow about our meeting and that Epstein is going to plead to a state charge and \nthe Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal. There has been some coverage in the \nNew York press about Ken Starr, but I haven't seen anything local yet. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nEFTA00014090\n\nFrom: \n(USAFLS) \nSent: Thursday, September 06, 2007 5:35 PM \nTo: \n. (USAFLS) \nSubject: \nEpstein \nPlease refresh my recollection. What is the \"deal\" on the table? \nEFTA00014091",
