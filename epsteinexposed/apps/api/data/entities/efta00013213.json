    "text": "\n\nFrom: ' (USANYS)\" < \nTo: ' (USANYS)\" \n4 \nSubject: Epstein staffing \nDate: Tue, 16 Apr 2019 20:42:30 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nI think the only way we could put on Epstein is if we have it worked out that she is coming here this summer —\nthat would involve her agreement plus full buy-in from and If that is the case, then the fallout from adding \nher is minimal because (1) she is in VOC, which is a unit where it makes sense to have an assistant on this case to begin \nwith; and (2) word will get out that she is coming here. I would dispatch to tell her that we were only open to it if it \nwere confirmed she was coming here. \nCanvassing the list, the other people we could add would be M, =, or g I sense would not be thrilled about \nand I don't feel the need to add to anything significant right now, so I would probably say =. \nEFTA00013213",
