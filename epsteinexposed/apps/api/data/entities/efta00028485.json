The Busts do not appear to be \ndesigned \nfor use as sex toys, and appear \ninstead to be artwork. Nevertheless, based on my \nconversations \nwith law enforcement officers who have \ninterviewed Victim-1, I have learned that the Busts \nappear \nto be generally consistent with \nVictim\n-1's \ndescription of observing the Torso in \nEPSTEIN's \nbathroom in the Subject Premises. \nAccordingly, there is probable cause to believe that \nthe Busts \nare \ncorroborating evidence of Victim\n-I's \ndescription of the Subject \nPremises. \nb. Inside the Subject Premises, \nI  observed a room that, based on my \nconversations \nwith law enforcement officers who \nhave interviewed Victim-1, appears to be consistent with \nVictim\n-I's \ndescriptions of the \nMassage Room. The room contained a table covered \nwith a sheet, \nand \nappears to be a massage table. The walls appear to be covered in a type of felt-like \ntapestry \nfabric. I further observed \ntwo paintings and three photographs hanging on the walls \nof the Massage \nRoom. The paintings and \nphotographs depict \nnude \nfemales. One \nof the photographs appears to \ndepict a nude \ngirl. Based on my training and experience investigating crimes \ninvolving the sexual \nexploitation of children, \nthe girl appears to be approximately \n15 to 20 years old. \nc. Inside the Subject Premises, inside \na closet adjacent to a bathroom, I  observed a \nshelf that appears to contain several \nblack binders, with labels on the spine of each binder. In \nparticular, one of the binders is \nmarked with a series of labels, one of which reads: \n\"PB Girls.\" \nGiveri that the Indictment \ncharges EPS 1 EIN with participating in a \nconspiracy to engage in sex \ntrafficking \nof minor girls in both Palm Beach, Florida and New \nYork, I believe that \"PB Girls\" \nmay \nrefer to minor victims in Palm Beach, \nFlorida. \nd. Inside the Subject Premises, in \nwhat appears to be EPSTEIN's office, on or about \nthe second floor of the Subject Premises, I \nobserved what appears to be a taxidermied dog (the \n\"Doe). Based on my conversations \nwith law enforcement officers who have interviewed \n6 \n2017.0g.02 \nEFTA00028488\n\n10 \np.m. In view of the foregoing circumstances, I  respectfully submit that the present \ncircumstances demonstrate \ngood cause to execute the warrant after 10 p.m. \nSpecial gent \nFederal Bureau \nof \nInvestigation \nSworn to before me on \nJuly *2019 \nTHE HON \nRABLE BARBARA MOSES \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n8 \n2017.0A 02 \nEFTA00028489\n\nUNITED \nSTATES \nDISTRICT COURT \n.SOUTHERN \nDISTRICT OF NEW YORK. \nUNITED.\nSTATES OF AMERICA \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nDefendant. \nx \nSEALED \nINDICTMENT \n• \n19 Cr. \nCRIM \nCOUNT ONE \n(Sex \nTrafficking Conspiracy) \nThe Grand Jury \ncharges: \nOVERVIEW \n1.
