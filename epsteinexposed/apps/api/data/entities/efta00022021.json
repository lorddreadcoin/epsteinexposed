The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs \n2. According to the notes of his interview with us, said he knew but did not tell anyone thatMwas \nreleased or Epstein was without a  cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the c • warden to put aw\nsomeone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know ths as gone and \ndenies his prior statement. Do you have a  recollection of this interview? If so, ants to know if we think the \nnotes/MOI are correct. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNe 7 \nTe \nCe \nEFTA00022021",
