Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nOctober 13, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nMark \nCohen, Esq. \nCohen \n& Gresser LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East Tenth Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nBobbi \nStemheim, Esq. \nLaw \nOffices of Bobbi C. Stemheim \n33 West 19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Counsel: \nThe Government writes to notify you that it will take the position that the defendant has \nwaived any defense pursuant to Rule 12.2. \nRule 12.2 provides that, before a defendant asserts an insanity defense or introduces expert \nevidence \"relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant \nbearing on . . .  the issue of guilt,\" the defendant must provide the Government written notice \n\"within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion, or at any later time the court sets.\" Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 12.2(a)-(b). \nThe defendant's pretrial motions were due on January 25, 2021 (Dkt. No. 108), and her \nsupplemental pretrial motions were due on May 7, 2021 (Dkt. No. 250 at 1). Accordingly, the \nnotice period required by Rule 12.2 expired at least five months ago. The Government has not \nreceived \nany such notice. Although the Court has set a  deadline of four weeks before trial for \ndefense expert witness disclosures (id. at 2), that is not a deadline for Rule 12.2 notice, and in any \nevent, that deadline would likely provide insufficient time for the Government to assess the \ndefendant's notice, move for an examination of the defendant pursuant to Rule 12.2(c)(1)(B), \nretain an expert, and conduct the examination. \nEFTA00011133\n\nPage 2 \nIf the defendant intends to offer evidence covered by Rule 12.2 at trial notwithstanding the \nabove, the Government demands notice no later than October 20, 2021, so that the Government \nmay raise the matter with the Court in a timely fashion before trial. \nVery truly yours, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  s/ \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00011134",
