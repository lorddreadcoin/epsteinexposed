This was from a while ago, but we need to follow up on the below questions I asked \nabout last year when you scanned in a  number of boxes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, now that discovery is \nunderway in the Maxwell case. \nThe first question is on the discs from the boxes, which you mentioned you did not extract but which you made copies of. \nCan you please tell us how those discs were marked? We're not sure that we can tell them apart from the other DVDs we \nreceived that contain the hard-copy scans. Did the copied discs get transmitted with those DVDs, or were the sets of four \ndiscs kept in the boxes themselves? (And either way, what would their labeling be?) \nAnd second, you mentioned that there were some pornographic images that were not scanned, and said you would \nfollow up to see if a  notation was made as to where those images were located or if they could be readily found in output. \nThe issue is that if we don't know which specific items weren't scanned in a set of 20-something boxes, we may have no \nchoice but to just do the entire project over again, rather than trying to go page by page comparing the hard copies to the \nscans to see what's missing. \nPlease let us know as soon as possible? And either I ot cc'd here, will follow up on whatever the next \nsteps are. \nFrom: \nSent: Monde Jul 15 2019 04:10 \nTo \nCc: \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nPlease see my responses below. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, July 13, 2019 3:56 PM \nTo: \n: case recor s scanning \nThat's great, thanks very much for all your and your team's work and for the update. That makes sense regarding the lAs, \nthanks. \nWith respect to the images that were not scanned, is there any way to flag them in the original hard copies somehow, so \nthat we can easily find them and refer to them when the hard copy documents are sent back to New York? Just to avoid \nneeding to try to flip through all the original documents to find them. Let me check and see if a notation was made as to \nwhere these images were located or if I can readily/easily find them in output. \nRegarding the discs, I'm not sure I totally understand —  when you say four copies each, were there just four discs total? Or \npossibly I'm just misunderstanding the explanation. And related, is it right that those discs were not processed (just \ncopied) so we'll need to look at those separate for our review? Sorry I should have been clearer. We just copied the discs —\nnot processed and made four copies each which is our standard. The thought being when we burn output we always give \na complete set that in theory would go to the defense, AUSA, and two copies to the Agent (one for him/and a back-up). \nThe discs we found in the files contain pdfs (searchable), jpgs, gifs, and tif files \nEFTA00013245\n\nAnd final question is just how all the scanned materials will be transmitted, so we can plan how most efficiently to receive \nthem and get them processed here. We will send everything back to you on dvds. \nSits again, \nFrom \nSent: rr \na u : \nTo: \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nGood Afternoon! \nHere is the latest. We have finished scanning! \nIn the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 \nwhen it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or \nwho is at fault. I can tell you that we were able to conduct a search of our local network and retrieve the images. I spoke \nwith our Field Evidence Unit who recommended that prior to inserting the images we create a cover sheet that reflected \nthat the images were not a part of the \"original\" paper rather they were regenerated from a digital copy. The 1As in \nquestions are 1A10, 1A28, 1A84 as well as two missing serials in 31E-MM-108062-al SEC 001 SER 1-45. My digital team is \naddressing this matter and has assured me I'll be able to burn the output first thing Monday so that we can get everything \nreturned to you. \nA few other items to point out. There were some pornographic images of young girls. These were not imaged per our \nprotocols. You As you review the content anywhere these images may have been you will see a DocLab kicksheet that \nstates \"possible child pornography\" DO NOT SCAN. The original documents are still in their original location —  they were \njust not scanned. \nFinally, there were a number of discs scattered throughout. We made physical copies —  one for one ratio of each (four \ncopies each) to go along with the physical paper scanned. These wil be sent along with the discs we will generate. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in bright and early Monday morning. \nFro \nSent: ues ay, uy \nTo \nSub ect: RE: case records scanning \nThanks very much for letting us know, that's extremely helpful and we appreciate it! Looking forward to being in touch as \nit continues, and thanks again. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, July 09, 2019 15:55 \nTo \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nGentlemen: \nI just wanted to give you a  quick update. \nWe finished inventorying all 22 boxes and released everything to DocLab last evening for scanning. As of this writing we \nare looking good for meeting the original deadline —  give or take a day. We still have a few things to tweak, but I'm \nconfident that things are looking good and we'll have this wrapped up within the next day or two. I'll send you a more \ndetailed email tomorrow morning when I get in. \nTake care and have a good evening. \nEFTA00013246\n\nFrom \nSent: Wednesday, July 03, 2019 11:16 AM \nTo \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nThanks very much for the update — I think unless you guys can confirm that any prior scans were absolutely 100% done \ncorrectly (and separated by document, etc.), we'd prefer to have them just done in one full set now—particularly knowing \nthat this will all be the subject of discovery, which definitely wouldn't have been the case in 2013. \nthanks again, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesda Jul03 2019 11:10 \nTo: \nCc \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nHappy 4th of July Eve. We just received 22 boxes about 5 minutes ago. We discovered that the Miami Field Office had \nrequested DocLab to scan a  number of them back in 2013. I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that the images are available on \nour internal network so that I can access them and just simply reprocess the digital output, if not we'll re-prep and scan \naccordingly. We will keep you posted. \nTake care and have a great holiday. \nFrom \nSent: Tuesda , Jul 02, 2019 2:10 PM \nT \nCc: \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nWe're under time pressure but I think the most important thing is that your folks have the time you need to do the job in \na way you're comfortable with—being able to scan each document separately, dealing with any random scraps of paper, \npost-its, etc etc. If doing the best possible job requires an extra few days that's totally understandable, especially given the \nholiday. Thanks again for the focus on it, and for following up. \nFrom \nSent: Tuesda Jul 02 201914:06 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nI got the scan request thanks. \nHow much wiggle room can I get on the deadline we originally talked about of 7/10? I'm concerned that with the boxes \ngoing from 15 to 22 and now not showing up until sometime tomorrow and Thursday a holiday the 10th is going to be \nextremely tight. Can I extend out at all to the 16th? If not I understand and we'll work to make it work somehow. \nFrom: \nSe \nTo \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nEFTA00013247\n\nMy apologies, appartently with a Fedex pickup this size an appointment had to be setup. The pickup was scheduled for \ntoday and will arrive in VA tomorrow, tracking number 4744 7647 0418. \nThanks, \nSquad C-20 \nVCAC/Human Trafficking \nFrom \nSe \nTo \nCc \nSubject: RE: case records scanning \nQuickly following up on this, can we confirm the boxes went out last week? \nFrom \nSent: \nMonday.
