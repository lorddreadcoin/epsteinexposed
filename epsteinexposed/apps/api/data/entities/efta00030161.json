Particularly if you expect not to make a bail argument tomorrow, but rather consent to detention \nwithout prejudice to make an application in the coming days—we would just want to let the judge know that early \ntomorrow, if possible, if that's how ou prefer to proceed. Certainly understand if not, of course, but just to mention it. \nIn any event, my cell i \nThank you, and talk soon. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, July 06, 2019 20:52 \nTo:' • ' ' \nCc: \nSubject: RE: U.S. v. le rey Epstein \nMarty, \nI hadn't seen your email from a few minutes ago, I think they crossed —  while I go by my email isibut \nnow you have all the correct contact info. \nWith respect to the search, we'll follow up with you regarding the warrant —  I believe a copy of the warrant and an \ninventory either has been or will be (at the conclusion of the search) be delivered on site —  but we are cognizant of \npotential privilege issues and we appreciate you bring them to our attention as well. \nFrom: Martin G.
