    "text": "\n\nFrom \nTo \nSubject: RE: The OPR investigation - 8 years too late \nDate: Fri, 08 Mar 2019 16:23:59 +0000 \nAttachments: M_Lener_to_OPR_Feb_2019_PDF.pdf \nHey= and \nHere is correspondence (with attachments) about the OPR investigating. On December 10, 2010, I asked U.S. Attorney \nFerrer (S.D. Fla.) to investigate the \"most suspicious criminal case I have ever encountered.\" That letter was forwarded to \nOPR and, on May 6, 2011, OPR declined to investigate on grounds of ongoing litigation. \nNote: We have seen a privilege log from S.D. Fla. that makes it appear that there was some correspondence between OPR \nat Main Justice and S.D. Florida in connection with my letter. That correspondence was deemed \"privileged\" in some way, \nso we've never seen it. But you should be able to get it. \nOf course, as you know, in about January 2019, OPR did open an investigation into the case ... prompting my February 7, \n2019 letter (attached) requesting that the victims be kept informed. I've received a response and we're going to set up a \nconference call soon. \nfor Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 \nCONFIDENTIAL: This electronic message - along with any/all attachments - is confidential.
