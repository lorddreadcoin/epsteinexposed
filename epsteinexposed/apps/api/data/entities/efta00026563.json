Apparently through (with?) their attorney, \nthey talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. The reporter believes \nthat it was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it went nowhere. \nCNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information, so if \nthey feel their competition will go with the story, they will, too. \nAny guidance or thoughts are welcome. \nPublic Affairs \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/usaosdny\nFollow us on Twitter: @SDNYnews \nEFTA00026563",
