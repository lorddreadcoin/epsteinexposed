Sorry for the quality. Should be 11 emails. This is ttl. Corresponds to the \nfollowing transcript passage in the pros memo (with some additional time before and after): \nQ: Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at any of Mr. Epstein's properties? \nA: First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage. \nI will ask that question if you want, but I was focusing on people other than Mr. Epstein right now. \nA: I don't give massages. \nCI: Let's just tie that down. Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a massage? \nA: I have not given anyone a massage. \nCI: You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony? \nA: That is my testimony. \nCI: \nYou never gave a massage is your testimony? \nA: I never gave \n-a\n massage. \nEFTA00027458",
