Marc A.\" \n.. 11 \nCc:  \nSubject: RE: following up \nDate: Fri. 09 Apr 2021 14:29:28 +0000 \nMarc and Andy, \nI'm writing to ask for one point of clarification regarding the estate's position regarding the assertion of attorney-client \nprivilege. You previously conveyed to us that the estate asserted privilege with respect to devices the FBI seized from \nJeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI in 2019. We accordingly assembled a firewall team to conduct a \nprivilege review of the contents of those devices. \nThe FBI is also in possession of a  computer that the Palm Beach Police Department seized from Epstein's residence in Palm \nBeach in 2005, which our office has not reviewed. Is the estate also asserting privilege with respect to devices such as this \none that were seized in Florida in 2005? \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nSt. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, March 31, 2021 1:59 PM \nTo: Weinstein, Marc A. . \nCc: \nSubject: RE: following up \n>; \nThanks, talk to you then.
