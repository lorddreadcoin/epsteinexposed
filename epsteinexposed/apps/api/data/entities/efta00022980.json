Those reports \nsuggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, \ncondemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been \"zero \nco-operation\". This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements \nascribed to Mr Berman and to the DOJ/FBI: \"F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out \nto his lawyers and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar \nwith the investigation.\" (New York Times 27.01.20) and \"Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal \nprosecutors and the FBI had asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but hod \nbeen met with a wall of silence\"(The Telegraph 28.01.20). \nPlease provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the Dal/FBI \nincluding a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. \nWe note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the \nDOJ will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our \nconversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that Dal personnel and the US \nAttorney would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular \nwould not comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the DOJ. We ask you \nto confirm that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the \nDOJ. \nKind regards \nGary \nGary Bloxsome I  Partner \nBlackfords LLP I London I EC4M 7EF \nBlackfords LLP is a  limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number \n0C325398 at Hill House, 1 Mint Walk, Croydon, CR0 lEA.
