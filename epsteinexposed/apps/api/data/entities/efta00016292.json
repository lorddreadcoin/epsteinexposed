Staff have reported to me that she has reported that certain files do not work. \nCan you advise what types of files (i.e., video/excel/etc.) are on the drive and what players or applications may be necessary \nto view them? I'm trying to figure out what reasons may be for issues with the material on the drive. \nEFTA00016292\n\n8/21/2020 \n9:01 PM \n>>> \nWe just sent another drive via FedEx. This drive contains all of the discovery in the case to date.

We need to etch the drive with a \nnumber and provide an authorization memo so she can retain it. Then it will be provided to her. It can be password \nprotected so long as you include a cover letter that contains the password for her. \nis\neHo this helps, \n8/5/2020 4:34 PM \n> \n» \nWe ave a ar \nrive wit i  oa e iscovery t  at we nee to e iver to islaine Maxwell, at MDC. Could \nyou please let us know what the current protocol is for that? Also, it's our understanding that hard drives with \ndiscovery materials for inmates needs to be non-encrypted (and not have a password for access), is that also correct? \nWe're hoping to get these materials to her tomorrow if at all possible, so we greatly appreciate your help. And I'm \nreachable any time at -if it would be helpful to discuss. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00016294",
