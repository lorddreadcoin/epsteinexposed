As grounds for this Application the Government relies on the \nfollowing facts and authorities. \nI. Introduction \nI. I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. This Application is submitted in conjunction with the accompanying \naffidavit of a  law enforcement agent (\"Agent Affidavit\"), to be sworn before this Court, and \nincorporated by reference herein. I  make this Application based on information and belief, \nincluding the Agent Affidavit, my review of other documents in the case, and information received \nfrom investigative personnel. \n2. The Investigating Agency, Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, Service \nProviders, Subject Offenses, Successor Service Provider, and Successor Cellphone referenced in \nthis Application are as specified in the Agent Affidavit. \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026494\n\nII. Legal Authority \nA. Prospective Location Information \n3. The Government seeks to obtain both precision location information and cell site data \nfor the Target Cellphones on a  prospective basis (the \"Prospective Location Information\") for a \nperiod of 45 days from the date of this order —  the same period of time for which a warrant for a \ntracking device may be granted under Rule 41(e)(2)(C). It bears noting, however, that while the \nProspective Location Information may permit \"tracking\" the user of the phone in the colloquial \nsense, this is not an application for a warrant for a \"tracking device\" as defined in Fed. R. Crim. \nP. 41(a)(2)(E) and 18 U.S.C. § 3117(b). Those provisions only apply where an agent is seeking to \nphysically install a tracking device on a given object. Instead, the Prospective Location \nInformation will be obtained by requiring the Service Provider to provide the information. \n4. The authority for this application is found in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1), which authorizes \na court of competent jurisdiction to require any electronic communication service provider (which \nincludes a  cellular telephone service provider') to disclose any \"record or other information \npertaining to a subscriber other than the \"contents of communications,\" when the government \nobtains, inter cilia, a  warrant under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. § \n2703(cX1)(A). Because data concerning a  subscriber's location, such as precision location \ninformation and cell site data, constitutes \"information pertaining to a subscribe?' that does not \ninclude the \"contents of communications,\" that data is among the types of information available \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) (incorporating by cross-reference statutory definitions set forth in 18 \nU.S.C. § 2510); 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15) (defining \"electronic communication service\" as \"any \nservice which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic \ncommunications\"). \n2 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026495\n\nunder § 2703(c)(1)(A).2   Further, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2711(3), this Court is a  court of \ncompetent jurisdiction under the Stored Communications Act because it has jurisdiction over the \nSubject \nOffenses. \n5. The Government's request for cell site data also implicates the pen register statute, \nbecause such data constitutes signaling information used by the Service Providers to route \ncommunications to and from the Target Cellphones. In order to collect such data, a  valid pen \nregister order is required.3   Accordingly, I  hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that such \nsignaling information is relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating \nAgency into suspected violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. \nB. Historical Location Information \n6. The Government also seeks historical cell site data for the Target Cellphones for the \nperiod from June I, 2020 to the present (the \"Historical Location Information\"). Because such \ndata—like \"Prospective Location Information\"—constitutes information concerning a subscriber, \nthe Court is authorized to order the Service Providers to provide this data pursuant to a  warrant \n2 See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 459-60 & n. 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Kaplan, J.) \n(cellphone location information falls within § 2703(c)(1)); accord, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, \n963 F. Supp. 2d 341, 361 (D.Vt. 2013); In re Order, 632 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); \nIn re Application, 405 F. Supp. 2d 435, 444-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But see In re Application, 849 \nF. Supp. 2d 526, 574 (D.Md. 2011) (rejecting view that cellular location data falls within the scope \nof the SCA and finding that phone must be treated as \"tracking device\" for purposes of Rule 41 \nwhere used to collect location data); In re Application, 2009 WL 159187, at *5-'1'6 (S.D.N.Y. \nJan.13, 2009) (McMahon, J.) (same). \n3 See 18 U.S.C. § 3121 (prohibiting use of pen register or trap and trace device without an order \nunder the pen register statute); 3127(3) & (4) (defining pen register and trap and trace device to \ninclude devices or processes that record, inter alio, signaling information). Although cell site data \nconstitutes \"signaling\" information within the meaning of the pen register statute, a separate statute \nprecludes the Government from relying \"solely\" on the authority provided by the pen register \nstatute to ascertain a subscriber's location. 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a). Here, the Government seeks to \nobtain such data pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) as well as the pen register statute, rather than \n\"solely\" under the latter statute. See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 456-59. \n3 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026496\n\napplication under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2703(c)(1)(A). I respectfully submit that the same probable cause supporting the Government's \nrequest for a warrant to obtain the Prospective Location Information requested above also supports \nthe issuance of a warrant under § 2703(c) for the requested Historical Location Information. In \naddition, the Government seeks toll records for the same period as the Historical Location \nInformation. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), I respectfully submit that the Agent Affidavit offers \nspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll \nrecord information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. \nC. Pen Register Information \n7. Finally, the Government seeks an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-26 authorizing \nthe use of a pen register on the Target Cellphones for a  period of 45 days from the date of this \norder. Specifically, the Government seeks an order directing the Service Providers to furnish any \ninformation, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to operate, unobtrusively and with \nminimum disruption of service, a  pen register and trap and trace device to capture all dialing, \nrouting, addressing, or signaling information associated with each call transmitted to or from the \nTarget Cellphones, as specified further in the proposed Warrants and Orders (the \"Pen Register \nInformation\").4\nThe Government is also not seeking authorization to obtain post-cut-through dialed digits \n(\"PCTDD\"), or digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Cellphones has been \nconnected. Pursuant to the attached Order, if possible, the Service Provider will forward only pre-\ncut-through-dialed digits to the Investigating Agency. However, if the Service Providers' \ntechnical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, including PCTDD, to the Investigating \nAgency, the Investigating Agency will only decode and forward to the agents assigned to the \ninvestigation the numbers that are dialed before the call is cut through. \n4 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026497\n\n8. I  hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that the Pen Register Information is \nrelevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating Agency into suspected \nviolations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. \nD. Sealing and Non-Disclosure Order to Service Providers \n9. When the Government obtains records or information under § 2703(c), it is not required \nto notify the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3). Additionally, the Government may \nobtain an order precluding the Service Providers from notifying the subscriber or any other third-\nparty of the warrant or order obtained, for such period as the Court deems appropriate, where there \nis reason to believe that such notification will result in endangering the life or physical safety of \nan individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation \nof potential witnesses, or will otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. 18 U.S.C. \n§ \n2705(b). \n10. Further, 18 U.S.C. § 3I23(d) provides that an order directing installation of a  pen \nregister or trap and trace device shall direct the pertinent service provider \"not to disclose the \nexistence of the pen register or trap and trace device or the existence of the investigation to the \nlisted subscriber, or to any other person unless or until otherwise ordered by the Court.\" \nII. Accordingly, as explained further in the Agent Affidavit, in light of the confidential \nnature of the continuing criminal investigation and the adverse consequences expected in the event \nof premature notification, the Government respectfully requests that the Court direct the Service \nProviders not to notify the Subscribers or any other person of the Warrants and Orders sought \nherein for a period of one year, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if necessary. \n12. For similar reasons, I  respectfully request that the proposed Warrants and Orders, this \nApplication, and the accompanying Agent Affidavit, be maintained under seal until the Court \norders otherwise, except that the Government be permitted without further order of this Court to \n5 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026498\n\nserve these Warrants and Orders on the Service Providers; provide copies of the Warrants and \nOrders or the supporting Application and Agent Affidavit as need be to personnel assisting the \nGovernment in the investigation and prosecution of this matter; and disclose these materials as \nnecessary to comply with discovery and disclosure obligations in any prosecutions related to this \nmatter. \nIII. Prior Requests \n13. Except as may be set forth above, no prior request for the relief requested herein has \nbeen made. \nDated: New York, New York \nJune \n29, 2020 \nAssistant United States Attorney \nTel.: \n6 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026499\n\nOriginal \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nIn re: Warrants and Orders For \nProspective and Historical Location \nInformation and Pen Register \nInformation for the Cell hones \nAssigned Call Numbers \nand \nUSAO \nReference \nNo. 2018R01618 \nAGENT AFFIDAVIT \n20 mag. 6770\nAgent Affidavit in Support of Warrants and \nOrders \nfor \nCellphone Location and Pen Register \nInformation \nSTATE OF NEW YORK ) \n) ss. \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK ) \nbeing duly sworn, deposes and states: \n1. Introduction \nI. I  have been a  Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\" or \n\"Investigating Agency\") since 2017. As such, I am a \"federal law enforcement officer within the \nmeaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged \nin enforcing the criminal laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search \nwarrant. I  am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the sexual \nexploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area through \nclassroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my \nresponsibilities, I  have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, \nenticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the \nexecution of search warrants involving electronic evidence. \n2. \nRequested Information. I  respectfully submit this Affidavit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 2703(c) and (c)(1)(A) and the applicable procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026500\n\n18 \nU.S.C. §§ 2703(d) & 2705; and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3126, in support of two warrants and orders \nfor prospective location information, historical location information, toll records, and pen register \ninformation, for the Target Cellphones identified below (collectively, the \"Requested \nInformation\"). \n3. Basis for Knowledge. This Affidavit is based upon my participation in the \ninvestigation, my examination of reports and records, and my conversations with other law \nenforcement agents and other individuals, as well as my training and experience. Because this \nAffidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of obtaining the Requested Information, it \ndoes not include all the facts that I  have learned during the course of this investigation. Where the \ncontents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, \nthey are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. In addition, unless \notherwise indicated, statements by others referenced in this Affidavit were not necessarily made \nto me, but may have been provided to me by someone else to whom I have spoken or whose report \nI  have read (and who in turn may have had either direct or indirect knowledge of the statement). \nSimilarly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Affidavit resulting from surveillance \ndoes not necessarily set forth my personal observations, but may have been provided to me by \nother law enforcement agents who observed the events, and to whom I  have spoken or whose \nreport I  have read. \n4. Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, and Service Providers. The \nTarget Cellphones referenced in this Affidavit are the cellphone assigned call number \n(\"Target Cellphone-1\") and the cellphone assigned call number (\"Target \nCellphone-2,\" and collectively with Target Cellphone-1, the \"Target Cellphones\"). As further \ndiscussed below, Target Cellphone-1 is subscribed to in the name of \"Terramar Project, Inc.\" \n2 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026501\n\n(\"Subscriber-1\"), and Target Cellphone-2 is subscribed to in the name of \"G Max\" (\"Subscriber-\n2,\" and collectively with Subscriber-I, the \"Subscribers\"). GHISLAINE MAXWELL is believed \nto use the Target Cellphones and is a Target Subject of this investigation. T-Mobile is the Service \nProvider for Target Cellphone-1, and AT&T is the Service Provider for Target Cellphone-2. \n5. Precision Location Capability. Cellphone service providers have technical \ncapabilities that allow them to collect at least two kinds of information about the locations of the \ncellphones to which they provide service: (a) precision location information, also known as E-911 \nPhase II data, GPS data, or latitude-longitude data, and (b) cell site data, also known as \n\"tower/face\" or \"tower/sector\" information. Precision location information provides relatively \nprecise location information about a cellphone, which a provider can typically collect either via \nGPS tracking technology built into the phone or by triangulating the device's signal as received \nby the provider's nearby cell towers. Cell site data, by contrast, reflects only the cell tower and \nsector thereof utilized in routing any communication to and from the cellphone, as well as the \napproximate range of the cellphone from the tower during the communication (sometimes referred \nto as \"per-call measurement\" (\"PCM\") or \"round-trip time\" (\"RTT\") data). Because cell towers \nare often a half-mile or more apart, even in urban areas, and can be ten or more miles apart in rural \nareas, cell site data is typically less precise than precision location information. Based on my \ntraining and experience, I  know that the Service Providers have the technical ability to collect \nprecision location information from any cellphone on its network, including by initiating a signal \non the Service Providers' network to determine the phone's location. I  further know that cell site \n3 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026502\n\ndata is routinely collected by the Service Providers in the course of routing calls placed to or from \nany cellphone on their network.' \n6. Successor Service Provider. Because it is possible that the Target Subject may change \ncellphone service provider during the course of this investigation, it is requested that the warrant \nand investigative order requested apply without need for further order to any Successor Service \nProvider who may provide service to the Target Cellphones during the time frames at issue herein. \nII. Facts Establishing Probable Cause \n7. Although I  understand that probable cause is not necessary to obtain all of the \nRequested Information, I  respectfully submit that probable cause exists to believe that the \nRequested Information will lead to the location of a  person, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, to be \narrested for the crimes of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a  minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal \nsexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting a  minor with intent to engage in \ncriminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1623 (the \n\"Subject Offenses\"). \n8. On June 29, 2020, a  grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an \nindictment charging GHISLAINE MAXWELL with the Subject Offenses. The Indictment \ncharging MAXWELL is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the \"Indictment\"). That same day, United \nStates Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith signed a warrant for MAXWELL's arrest, which is \nattached as Exhibit B hereto (the \"Arrest Warrant\"). \n'  Toll records are sometimes necessary or helpful in order to obtain or interpret historical cell site \ndata and are therefore also requested herein. \n4 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026503\n\n9. In light of these pending charges in the Indictment and the issuance of the Arrest \nWarrant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL is subject to arrest for the Subject Offenses. \n10. Based on my review of T-Mobile records, I  have learned that Target Cellphone-1 is \nsubscribed in the name of \"Terramar Project, Inc.\" Based on my review of publicly available \nvideos and related information, I  know that GHISLAINE MAXWELL has given multiple public \naddresses in her capacity as the founder and president of an organization known as the TerraMar \nProject, a non-profit organization that, as noted, was founded and run by MAXWELL and devoted \nto ocean protection. \nII. As set forth in Paragraph 3  of Exhibit A, MAXWELL was a  close associate and \nemployee of Jeffrey Epstein's. Additionally, as set forth in Paragraphs 1  through 19 of Exhibit A, \nMAXWELL is charged with committing four of the Subject Offenses together with Epstein. I \nknow from my participation in this investigation that on or about July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested \nby the FBI on federal sex trafficking charges. During that arrest, the FBI seized an iPhone from \nEpstein's possession (the \"Epstein Phone\"). Pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant, \nthe FBI subsequently searched the contents of the Epstein Phone. Among other things, that search \nrevealed that the phone number associated with Target Cellphone-1 was saved as a contact in the \nEpstein Phone under the name \"Ghislaine.\" \n12. I  further know from my review of T-Mobile records the following: \na. Target Cellphone-1 has been active within the last 30 days. \nb. Target Cellphone-1 has been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the name \nof \"Joshua Perry,\" which I  know from my review of a law enforcement database is the name of \nthe husband of a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein (the \"Joshua Perry Phone\"). The most recent \ncontact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Joshua Perry Phone occurred in or about May 2020. \n5 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026504\n\nc. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a  phone subscribed to the \nbusiness \"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman,\" which I  know from my review of court records is the \nname of a  law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the \n\"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone\"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 and \nthe Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred in or about February 2020. \nd. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the \nname of \"Isabel Maxwell,\" which I  know from my review of a  law enforcement database is the \nname of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the \"Isabel Maxwell Phone\"). The most recent \ncontact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about August \n2019. \ne. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the \nname of \"Laura Menninger,\" which I  know from my review of court records is the name of an \nattorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the \"Laura \nMenninger Phone\"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-I and the Laura \nMenninger Phone occurred in or about August 2019. \nf. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the \nname of \"Scott Borgerson,\" which I  know from my review of bank records and Amazon records \nis the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank account \nand to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within approximately \nthe last year (the \"Scott Borgerson Phone\"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 \nand the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about August 2019. \n13. Accordingly, I  respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that the location \nof Target Cellphone-1 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. \n6 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026505\n\n14. Based on my review of AT&T records, I  have learned that Target Cellphone-2 is \nsubscribed in the name of \"G Max,\" which appears to be a  shortened version of GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL's name. I  further know from my review of AT&T records that Target Cellphone-2 \nhas been active within the last 30 days. In particular, within the last 30 days, Target Cellphone-2 \nhas been in contact with the Isabel Maxwell Phone, the Laura Menninger Phone, the Haddon, \nMorgan, & Foreman Phone, and the Scott Borgerson Phone. \n15. Accordingly, I  respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the \nlocation of Target Cellphone-2 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. \nIII. Request for Warrants and Orders \n16. Based on the foregoing, I  respectfully request that the Court require the Service \nProviders to provide the Requested Information as specified further in the Warrants and Orders \nproposed herewith, including prospective precision location and cell site data for a period of 45 \ndays from the date of this Order, historical cell site data and toll records for the period from June \nI, 2020 through the date of this Order, and pen register information for a period of 45 days from \nthe date of this Order. \n1. Nondisclosure. The scope of this ongoing criminal investigation and existence of \nthe Indictment and Arrest Warrant are not publicly known. As a result, premature public disclosure \nof this affidavit or the requested Warrants and Orders could alert GHISLAINE MAXWELL that \nshe is under investigation and subject to arrest, causing her to destroy evidence, flee from \nprosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. Specifically: \na. As evidenced by the charges alleged in the Indictment, MAXWELL is known \nto have participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Alerting her to the existence and scope of \nthe investigation may lead her to intimidate witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(1),(4). \n7 \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026506\n\nb. Additionally, the Target Subject is at liberty in the community. Premature \ndisclosure of the existence of this application and the charges contained in the Indictment could \nresult in the Target Subject fleeing from prosecution if she were made aware of the pending charges \nbefore arrest. See 18 U.S.C. § \n2705(b)(2). \n17. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that, were the Service Providers to notify the \nsubscribers or others of the existence of the warrant, the investigation would be seriously \njeopardized. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), I  therefore respectfully request that the Service \nProviders be directed not to notify the subscribers or others of the existence of the Warrants and \nOrders for a period of one year, and that the Warrants and Orders and all supporting papers be \nmaintained under seal until the Court orders otherwise, as specified in the Application submitted \nin conjunction with this Affidavit. \nSworn to before me this \n29 \nday \nof \nJune, 2020 \neattamoll\ni \natc. \nHONORABLE KATHARINE H.

Findings \nThe Court hereby finds: \n1. The Target Cellphone (the \"Target Cellphone\") that is the subject of this Order is \nassigned call number is subscribed to in the name of \"Terramar Project, Inc.\" (the \n\"Subscribe?), and is currently serviced by the Service Provider. \n2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(A) and the applicable provisions of Rule 41 of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government's application sets forth probable cause to \nbelieve that the prospective and historical location information for the Target Cellphone will reveal \nthe location of a person to be arrested for suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2422, 2423(a), \nand 1623 (\"the Subject \nOffenses\"). \n3. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), the Government's application also sets forth specific \nand articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll records for \nthe Target Cellphone are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. \n2019.07.24 \nEFTA00026508\n\n4. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1), the Government has certified that the pen register \ninformation for the Target Cellphone is relevant to an ongoing investigation by the Investigating \nAgency of GHISLAINE MAXWELL and others unknown in connection with suspected violations \nof the \nSubject Offenses. \n5. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), there is reason to believe that notification of the \nexistence of this Warrant and Order will result in flight from prosecution, and/or intimidation of \npotential witnesses, or otherwise will seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation. \nNOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Fed.
