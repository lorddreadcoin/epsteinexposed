BOP plans to respond to those \nrequests quickly and release the same records. \nOne minor wrinkle: the FOIA specialist at BOP has tried to contact Mark Epstein a couple times regarding his \ncommunications from about a month ago. But so far he has not responded to her. She has asked if we have contact info \nfor him. What I have is this phone number and these emails Mark Epstein and \nSTACEY RICHMAN . I am going to confirm BOP has these, but please let me know if there is \nsome other way to contact him. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nTelephone: \nEFTA00014714",
