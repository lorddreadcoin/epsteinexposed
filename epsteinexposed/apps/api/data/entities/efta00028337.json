Please do not pass on our contact info. That said, feel free to contact us if anything comes up in \nyour investigation. \nThank you. Hope you guys are all hanging in okay. \nMOM \nOn Jun 5, 2020, at 3:19 PM \n[EXTERNAL EMAIL) \nBrendan, \nvrote: \nAn attorney for an individual who has an active civil case in connection with Epstein has reached out to us to ask if we \nknow the current counsel for Mr. Rodgers. I assume that the attorney is seeking to serve a request or subpoena for \ndocuments and/or testimony, though we haven't asked specifically. \nI don't think we ordinarily engage on that type of question, but given that we have been in touch with you in connection \nwith our interview of Mr. Rodgers, if you'd like we can pass along your contact info, so that the attorney goes to you \nEFTA00028337\n\nrather than attempting to contact or serve Mr. Rogers directly. And if not, of course no problem, and we'll just let him \nknow that we're not able to comment one way or the other on the status of any counsel. Whatever you prefer. \nThanks, and hope you're well these days. \nFro \nSent. „ \nTo: \nCc: \nSu . . \nThank= \nFrom  \nSent: Friday, Febr \nTo: Quigley, Brend \nCc: \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation Ro gers \n[EXTERNAL EMAIL] \nBrendan, \nAs promised, attached please find a copy of the proffer agreement signed today. \nConfidentiality Notice: \nThe information contained in this email and any attachments is intended only for the recipient[s] listed above and may be privileged \nand confidential.
