In her calls to the FBI, she claims \nthat she is doing a documentary and writing a book regarding human trafficking and about Epstein's use of a \nmodeling agency to assist him in trafficking underage girls into the United States to use in sexual conduct. \nA few years ago, FBI tried to get documentation from her \"source\" regarding these allegations, but the \"source\" \ndidn't appear for interviews and never provided documentation. Sarnoff recently began calling FBI Miami to \nagain make these allegations. It is my understanding that FBI has told Samoff that if her \"source\" wants to come \nforward with evidence and be interviewed, FBI is more than willing to listen, but Sarnoff is dissatisfied with that \nresponse. \nObviously I haven't called ack, but I assume that she is calling us for the same reason. If so, can \nyou direct her to at t  e BI? \nThank \nyou! \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nEFTA00019171",
