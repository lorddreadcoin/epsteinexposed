As an initial matter, the majority of the docket entries \nyou've referenced do not appear to be redacted. In any event, you may obtain these materials from defense counsel -- I've \ncopied them here. This case is already governed by a protective order (ECF No. 36), which is binding on all counsel. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York.

Ghislaine Maxwell \nGood afternoon counsel: \nI have been engaged to represent Ghislaine Maxwell in her appeal from the denial of her third application for \nbail. In preparing this appeal, I will need access to certain unredacted documents, including docket entries 4, \n18, 22, 97, 100, 103, 106, 159, 160, 165, 171, 169. Do you have any objection to me having access to these \nunredacted documents? (There may be additional documents that I need, but I have not identified them as of \nyet.) I'm happy to enter into a protective order with the government if you believe that is necessary. I plan on \nfiling the appeal next week, so I would appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible. \nThank you, \nDavid \n--David Oscar Markus \nmarkuslaw.com \nEFTA00020438",
