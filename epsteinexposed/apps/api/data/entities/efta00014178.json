PA._ \nDecember 9, \n2009 \nAssistant United \nStates Attorney \nUnited States \nAttorney's Office \nSouthern \nDistrict of Florida \n500 \nSouth Australian Avenue \nSuite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, Florida \n33401 \nRE: Jeffrey \nEpstein \nDear= \nJESSICA \nFONSECA-NADER \nKATHLEEN P. \nMinns \nAARON ANTHON \nMARCOS \nBEATON, JR. \nMATDIEW \nP. O'BRIEN \nJENIPER \nJ. \nSOULIKIAS \nNOAH Fox \nE\n-Mail: \nYou emailed \nme a letter on November 2, asking whether Jeffrey \nEpstein's \nplace of employment remained constant. It has. I  reviewed a Google map to \nconfirm that the distance between that \nplace of employment and the location \nwhere he was stopped by Palm Beach Police is \nless than 3 miles (and that the \nlocation \nwhere he was walking was on a direct mute to his place of work). \nIt has taken us a while to respond to your letter because other matters have \nconsumed our time and effort. Over the past five weeks, the massive billion-dollar \nconspiracy created and run by Scott Rothstein has been exposed. On Monday, \nMr. Epstein filed a state civil RICO lawsuit charging Rothstein, his partner Brad \nEdwards, and others with tortuous and \nfraudulent abuses of process that resulted \nin serious injury to Mr. Epstein. A \ncopy of the Complaint is enclosed with this \nletter. \nAs ou know, Rothstein's firm represents and \nthree of the plaintiffs who have brought civil \nactions against Mr. \nEpstein. The Rothstein firm was a criminal enterprise that used the litigation \nagainst Mr. Epstein to lure \ninvestors into its billion-dollar ponzi scheme. We \nbelieve that Rothstein and his co-conspirators \nused the government's criminal \ninvestigation as a means to \nperpetrate and further their fraud. For example: \n201 S. Biscayne Boulevard. Suite 1300 • Miami. Florida 33131 • Phone: 305-371.6421 • Fax: \n30S-358.2006 • whw.RoyBlack.eom \nEFTA00014178\n\nDecember 9, 2009 \nPage 2 \n1. The Rothstein lawyers sought disclosure of the NPA to prove who the \nvictims were, and used the NPA to \n\"corroborate\" their false claims. \n2. Rothstein and his co-conspirators abused the legal process in other \ncases. They forged the signature of judges, and even forged an Eleventh Circuit \nopinion. \n3. Rothstein lawyers demanded phony protective orders. \n4. In our case, they sought discovery of Epstein's plane logs to fish for \ncelebrities to extort and convince investors that huge amounts of settlement \nmoney was available from them. \n5. Rothstein lawyers litigated claims using Jane Doe names to \nmake the \nphony settlements appear plausible to \ninvestors, and also to prevent any \ninvestigation into the claims by the investors. \n6. Rothstein and others told investors that your office directed the women \nto the Rothstein firm. \n7. Rothstein and his co-conspirators gathered information illegally, and \nshared it with the other plaintiffs' attorneys in this case. \n8. Rothstein deceived investors into believing that he had the confidential \nvictim list you prepared, and that he had a copy of the NPA. \n9. Rothstein told investors that his investigators had sophisticated \nelectronic bugging equipment to gather evidence against Epstein. \n10. Rothstein told investors that Epstein had offered to settle the cases for \n$200 million, when there have been no such discussions about any settlement at \nany price. \nAnd it does not stop there. Rothstein, his partners, and his employees \ninvestigated and litigated the M, and cases with funds derived \nfrom their criminal enterprise and their fraud and misrepresentations to investors. \nBut we have been stymied from debunking fraudulent claims brought by the \nRothstein criminal enterprise \nbecause you have threatened that \nsuch action on \nBlack \nSrebnick. Komspan & Stumpf, PA \nEFTA00014179\n\nDecember 9, 2009 \nPage 3\nour part would constitute a breach of the NPA. So the Rothstein lawyers, once \nagain, are using the power of the federal government to perpetrate and further \ntheir fraud. And the expense of litigating these cases has been extreme. For \nexample, who I do not believe was aware of the Rothstein crimes, \nis now demanding over $2 million in legal fees. \nAs a lawsuit brought by some of the investors' claims, Rothstein and his \npartner Edwards \nused Jeffrey Epstein as bait. The litigation strategy, media \npronouncements, and investigatory initiatives of Rothstein and Edwards were \ncalculated to support Rothstein's \ndeceptions rather than to advance the position \nof his clients. I  bring these facts to your attention so that if you had contact with \nEdwards or those associated with him in the past concerning Mr. Epstein, you \nconsider not continuing communications with any \nof them in the future. \nI  would like a short conference with \nyou in person to talk about Mr. \nEpstein's progress through the state criminal justice system, to discuss several \noutstanding issues that I want to make sure you have \naccurate information about, \nand, from my perspective, most importantly, so that I  can provide Mr. Epstein \nwith proper counsel going forward. If you email me some dates when you are \navailable this \nmonth, we can schedule a short meeting in your office hopefully \nbefore the year ends. \nRoy Black \nRB/wg \nEnclosure \nBlack. Srebnick.
