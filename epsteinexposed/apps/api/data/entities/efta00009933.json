It will be very helpful for us to have a record of her \ngeneral appearance then, for legal reasons, and we're happy to either make copies and return them to her, or to \nhave them in safekeeping with us until the investigation is complete, whatever she prefers. \nthanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, Ma   23, 2019 13:08 \nTo: 'Isidro Garcia'  \nEFTA00009933\n\nCc: Mark \nJohnson \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation meeting \nMr. Garcia, \nFollowing up on our phone conversation yesterday, I wanted to send you an email, as promised, as a brief \nsummary. As discussed, our investigation continues to move forward, and we're interested in meeting with'. \n=again to talk with her more specifically about her recollections from the time. Although we have the notes \nfrom her interviews from the prior investigation, it is important for us at this stage to have a sense of what he \ncurrent recollection is about his conduct. As I  mentioned, we absolutely do not want to feel re-\nvictimized or dragged through this unnecessarily; rather, we are hoping to confirm our understanding of what she \ndescribed in previous interviews (as to her recollection now). I promise we would not ask her to talk about those \nexperiences if it weren't important—and useful—to the current investigation. \nAs we also talked about, when we meet with her we'd like to ask her to please bring the materials she described \nhaving when we first met—I believe she said she had a box of materials from the time, possibly including one or \nmore phones, possibly photos or gifts, etc. Really anything she has relating to that time or experiences could be \nvery helpful. We would be happy to provide her with copies of anything that she still wants to retain, and of \ncourse we will treat her possessions with the utmost care and would expect to return them, if she wants, at the \nconclusion of the investigation. \nPlease let us know if you or she has any questions about any of this at all, and we look forward to meeting with \nher and you next week. (I understand the timing of that may be changing now—we remain available anytime on \nthe 29th, or can discuss other days if that doesn't work—unfortunately the agents aren't available on the 31st, but \nI'm sure we'll figure it out.) \nThanks very much again, and please express our appreciation a for meeting with us again, we really \nappreciate it. \nthank you, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00009934",
