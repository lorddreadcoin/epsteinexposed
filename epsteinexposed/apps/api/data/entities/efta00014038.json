Let me know how you would like me to proceed. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax 561 820-8777 \n--Original Message--\nFrom: Roy BLACK [mailto:RBLACK(groyblaciccom]\nSent \nWcAnnc,l..t. \nMnyn,hpr \n76 flflR \n11:56 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein \nPo\nsince receipt of your letter I have looked into the situation and \ne lowing is what is happening: \nMr. Epstein has not breached the Non-Prosecution Agreement \n(the \"Agreement\") by serving a portion of his 18-month \nsentence of imprisonment in the Palm Beach County Work \nRelease Program. \n1. He is currently serving his sentence in the Palm \nBeach County Work Release Program, not in the \nState-Regulated Community Control Program. Thus he is not on community \ncontrol. \no The County Jail sentence he is presently serving is \nbeing served under the auspices of the Palm Beach \nCounty Sheriff's Office. \no The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has a policy \nof allowing work release under certain criteria for \nthose sentenced to the Palm Beach County Detention \nCenter or Stockade. It has already been determined \nthat Mr. Epstein qualifies under the Palm Beach County Sheriff's \nOffice policy for work release. The Florida statute \nauthorizing work release for someone imprisoned in \ncounty jail is at 951.24 (2Xa). \no The statute provides that when punishment by \nimprisonment in the county jail is prescribed, the \nsentencing court, in its discretion, may at any time \nduring the sentence consider granting the privilege to \nthe prisoner to leave the confines of the jail or \ncounty facility during necessary and reasonable hours, \nEFTA00014038\n\nsubject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the \ncourt, to work at paid employment or to conduct his or \nher own business or profession. See Fla. Stat. § \n951.24(2)(a). \no In Palm Beach County, the Sheriff's Office has \ndiscretion over work release. The local rules state \nthat placement into House Arrest and Work Release \"is \nat the discretion of the Sheriff and the presiding \nJudge\" and offer no defined scope of the type of \noffenders that are eligible—or that are barred—from \nserving their time in Work Release.\" See Palm Beach \nCounty Department of Corrections Inmate Rule G-16. \n2. The Non Prosecution Agreement does not prohibit \nwork release. \no The Agreement does not regulate what programs Mr. Epstein can \nparticipate in while he is serving the County Jail \nsentence. \n3. The Agreement expressly provides that he is to be \nafforded the same benefits that any other inmate might \nreceive. See ¶ 12 of the Agreement. \n5. Under Florida Law, work release is considered part \nof the confinement. See Rule 33.60L602, Fla. Admin. \nCode. (work release \"allows inmates to work at paid \nemployment in the community while continuing as inmates \nof the facility where they are confined.\").So he is an inmate. \n6. recognized that Mr. Epstein \nmight serve a portion of his sentence through the Work \nRelease Program. \no. On December 6, 2007, after the Agreement had been \nexecuted, counsel received a draft notification \nletter in which US Attorney expresses this \nintention. The draft document provides that the \nrecipient is \"entitled to notification when Mr. Epstein \nis released from imprisonment at the end of his prison \nterm and/or if he is allowed to participate in a work \nrelease program.\" See December 6, 2007 letter to J. \nLefkowitz from- attaching draft notification \nletter, p. 8. \n7. I am told that on July 3, 2008, you wrote an email \nto the Deputy Sherriff stating that the US Attorney's \nOffice had no objection to work release as long as \nEpstein is treated as any similarly situated inmate. If anything \nhe is being treated more harshly than any other inmate in \nthe program. He can't leave the office. He has a guard \nand is wearing a GPS device. So his teens are not more lenientbut rather \nmore restrictive than any other \ninmate in the program. \nClearly we do not feel this is a violation of the agreement and we have \nno intent to violate it. We will meet with you and anyone in the \nexecutive office to resolve this matter. Certainly it would be best for \nus to meet and discuss. \nEFTA00014039\n\n>» \n11/24 \n: \n>» \nDear Roy: \nPlease U. \nAssistant U.S. \n500 S.
