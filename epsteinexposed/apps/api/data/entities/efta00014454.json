But one area where Acosta received \nstrident criticism was over a nonprosecution deal he \nstruck with Epstein in a teen sex trafficking case \nwhen he was the U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida about a decade before he became \nlabor secretary. \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra found in \nFebruary that Acosta and other prosecutors had \nmisled Epstein's victims about the existence of the \nnonprosecution agreement, thereby violating their \nright to be informed under the Crime Victims' Rights \nAct. That decision came several months after The \nMiami Herald published an investigative series that \nsaid Acosta gave Epstein the deal in exchange for a \nguilty plea to lesser state charges. The unusually \nEFTA00014454\n\nlenient agreement called off potential federal charges \nnot only against Epstein but also against alleged co-\nconspirators. \nDemocratic Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida \nexpressed concern during Wednesday's hearing that \nAcosta's alleged mishandling of the Epstein case was \nan indication that he won't adequately protect \nworkers' interests over those of industry. \nBut that assertion drew a sharp rebuke from Acosta, \nwho said the U.S. Department of Justice has long \ntaken the position that the Crime Victims' Rights Act \nwasn't violated in the Epstein case. \n\"I understand that the judge disagreed with the \n[DOJ's] position, but we acted consistent with DOJ \nprotocol, rules and regulations and that's the position \nof the department based on my understanding of the \nlitigation,\" Acosta said, adding that the DOJ's \nposition hasn't changed across different \nadministrations and attorneys general. \n\"This matter was appealed all the way up to the \ndeputy attorney general's office, and not because we \nweren't doing enough, but because the contention was \nthat we were too aggressive,\" Acosta added. \nBesides the Epstein case, Acosta also fielded pointed \nquestions from committee Democrats on various \nrecent regulatory initiatives by the DOL, with most \nof the queries focusing on the Labor \nDepartment's recent proposal to overhaul its white-\ncollar overtime exemption regulations. \nThe proposed regulation would update the Fair Labor \nStandards Act's overtime exemptions for executive, \nadministrative and professional, or EAP, \nworkers, \nreplacing a previous version issued by the Obama \nadministration. \nEFTA00014455\n\nIf it is finalized without major changes, the rule will \nhike the DOL's salary threshold for white collar \nworkers to qualify for one of the EAP exemptions to \n$35,308 per year or \n$679 per week — up from the \n$23,660 annual salary that was set when the rule was \nlast updated in 2004, but lower than the $47,000 \ncutoff the Obama administration had proposed in \n2016. \nRep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top \nRepublican on the committee, expressed concern that \nthe Obama-era overtime regulation is still pending at \nthe Fifth Circuit and could conceivably be revived \nbefore the DOL is done with the current rulemaking \nprocess to replace it. \nAcosta, however, sidestepped her request for \n\"assurances\" that the proposed replacement rule \nwould be finalized \"in a timely manner,\" with the \nlabor secretary simply reiterating that the proposed \nregulation has been issued and the public notice-and-\ncomment period is ongoing. \nIn response to a question on the overtime rule from \nDemocratic Rep. Mark Takano of California, Acosta \ndefended the DOL's decision to appeal a ruling that \nblocked the Obama administration's version of the \nrule — the same one the DOL is currently trying to \nreplace — to protect the agency's ability to issue such \na rule at all. \n\"I think it's important when these rules are called into \nquestion, the U.S. government should defend them \nwhere appropriate,\" Acosta told Takano. \"We can \ndisagree with the policy underlying the rule and we \ncan still appeal the \nrule.\" \nIn a notable regulatory tidbit, Acosta divulged to \nlawmakers that the agency is working with the U.S. \nEFTA00014456\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on a new \nfiduciary rule. \nAn Obama-era version of the rule issued by the DOL \nrequiring retirement advisers to put their clients' \ninterests before their own when selling retirement \ninvestments was struck down by the courts. \n\"Based on our collaborative work we will be issuing \nnew rules in this area,\" Acosta said, but declined to \noffer a time frame for when any such rules might be \nissued. \nAcosta also addressed several other hot-button \nemployment topics during the hearing. He weighed in \non \nthe U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision last \nyear in Janus v. AFSCME 2., which deemed it \nunconstitutional for public-sector unions to collect \nso-called agency fees from nonunion workers that \ncover the costs associated with collective bargaining \nwithout their explicit consent. \nThe labor secretary told lawmakers he believes Janus \nwas a \"correct and appropriate\" decision, and that the \nDOL is enforcing the law in the wake of Janus \"to the \nextent that it comes within our authority.\" \nAcosta also responded to a question about the \nminimum wage from the Education and Labor \nCommittee chairman, Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott \nof Virginia, by saying the Trump administration \ndoesn't \"support a change to the federal minimum \nwage at this time.\" \n--Editing by Marygrace Murphy. \nEFTA00014457",
