Please let me know if there is anything you would like \nto \ndiscuss. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, April 20, 20212:05 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v Maxwell - [conferrals regarding pretrial disclosures & redactions to replies] \nFollowing-up on email, we are not seeking any redactions. As a general matter, the redactions we proposed in our \nreply briefs are almost entirely because the information was designated as Confidential by the government under the \nProtective Order. Accordingly, you are free to justify to the court any redactions you think are necessary. Our specific \npositions on the redactions in each brief are set forth below. Please confirm that the proposed course of action with \nrespect to each brief is acceptable. \nReply \nBrief 1 \nThe redactions relate to information designated as Confidential by the government under the Protective Order. The \ndefense has no objection to removing the redaction on page 5 and filing the brief and Exhibit A on the public record. \nGiven that the government takes no position about the redaction on page 5, but does want Exhibit A to remain under \nseal, we propose the following: (1) we will file the brief on the docket without redactions, but we will file Exhibit A under \nseal; and (2) the government can argue its position to the court in its letter that Exhibit A should remain under seal. If the \njudge does not agree, we will file Exhibit A on the docket at that time. \nReply \nBrief 3 \nThe redactions in the brief all relate to the names of AUSAs, the names of accusers, and-As to the \naccusers and the defense has no objection to removing those redactions. As to the AUSAs, we made \nEFTA00009890\n\nthose redactions as a courtesy because we did not think it was necessary or appropriate to publicly name the AUSAs. The \ndefense takes no position with respect to those redactions. \nAs for the exhibits, we filed certain exhibits under seal because they were designated as Confidential by the government \nunder the Protective Order. The defense has no objection to filing all of the exhibits on the public record, although we \nagree that email addresses and other contact information for third parties should be redacted pursuant to the court's \nlocal rules. You point out that the court has already adopted the government's proposed redactions to Exhibits J and O. \nThe defense is certainly prepared to follow those redactions. But since the government will need to justify the need for \nother redactions to the court, it makes more sense for the government to explain to the court in its letter that it would \nlike to follow the redactions already adopted by the court for Exhibits J and O. \nGiven the disagreement among the parties, we will not file the brief or the exhibits on the docket and the government can \nargue its position to the court in its letter. \nReply \nBrief 5 \nThe defense does not believe the redaction on p.4 is necessary. Given the agreement between the parties, we will file the \nbrief unredacted. \nReply \nBrief 6 \nThe redactions relate to information designated as Confidential by the government under the Protective Order. The \ndefense has no objection to removing the redactions and filing the brief on the public record. Given that the government \nwants to keep the redactions, we will not file the brief on the docket and the government can argue its position to the \ncourt in its letter. \nReply \nBrief 10 \nThe redactions relate to information designated as Confidential by the government under the Protective Order. The \ndefense has no objection to removing the redactions and filing the brief and Exhibit A on the public record. Given that the \ngovernment wants to keep the redactions and keep Exhibit A under seal, we will not file either document on the docket \nand the government can argue its position to the court in its letter. \nPlease let me know if you would like to discuss. \nRegards, \nFrom: \nSent: on ay, pn , : \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v Maxwell - [conferrals regarding pretrial disclosures & redactions to replies] \nWe can confirm for 3:00 pm EST tomorrow. Please use the following dial-in number: \nWe will write separately regarding the redactions that you propose. \nEFTA00009891\n\nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Mona A n  19 2021 4:55 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v Maxwell - [conferrals regarding pretrial disclosures & redactions to replies] \nWe are available to speak tomorrow after 2:30 pm EST. On the issue of redactions, on Friday, Judge Nathan ordered the \nparties to docket the April 1, 2021 joint letter or to propose redactions by April 19, 2021. (Dkt. 203). We do not believe \nany redactions are necessary to the letter. Assuming you agree, will you please docket the letter since you wrote the \nletter? If you would like to discuss, please let us know. \nAs to the redactions to the undocketed Reply Briefs and certain exhibits you proposed being filed under seal, below please \nfind our position for inclusion in a letter. If you would like to discuss tomorrow, please let us know. \nReply \nBrief 1 \nThe Government takes no position on the defendant's proposed redaction on page 5 of Reply Brief 1. The defense \nsubmitted Exhibit A to Reply Brief 1 under seal and the Government agrees that Exhibit A should remain sealed in order to \nprotect the privacy interests of victims and third parties. \nReply \nBrief 3 \nThe Government agrees with the defense's proposed redactions to Reply Brief 3, which are narrowly tailored to cover \ninformation implicating the personal privacy interests of victims and third parties. Further, the proposed redactions are \nconsistent with the redactions ordered by the Court on March 18, 2021. (Dkt. 168). \nAs to the exhibits to Reply Brief 3, the defense submitted Exhibits L, M, and N under seal. The Government filed Exhibit L \nin connection with its Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Defendant's Pretrial Motions as Exhibit 6. \nExhibit 6 was filed without any redactions and accordingly, the Government does not object to the public filing of Exhibit \nL. The Government does not object to the public filing of Exhibits M and N, but respectfully submits that the names and \nemail addresses/contact information of third parties should be redacted from Exhibits M and N to protect the privacy \ninterests of third parties. \nThe defense also submitted Exhibits J and O to Reply Brief 3 under seal. The Government filed Exhibits 5 and 7 to its \nopposition, which are, respectively, redacted versions of Exhibits 1 and O. See Dkt. 204. The Government had set forth \nproposed redactions to Exhibits 5 and 7 in order to protect the privacy interests of third parties, which the Court adopted \non March 18, 2021 (see Dkt. 168). Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defense should redact \nExhibits J and O to Reply Brief 3 to reflect the redactions approved by the Court and reflected in the publicly filed versions \nof Exhibits 5 and 7 to the Government's opposition. \nReply \nBrief 5 \nThe Government respectfully submits that there is no basis under the applicable standard to redact the language that the \ndefendant proposes redacting in Reply Brief S as it refers to language contained in the publicly-filed Indictment in this \ncase. The information in the Indictment is part of the public record and, therefore, has a diminished privacy interest. \nEFTA00009892\n\nReply \nBrief 6 \nThe Government agrees with the defense's proposed redactions to Reply Brief 6, which are narrowly tailored to cover \ninformation implicating the personal privacy interests of third parties. The proposed redactions are consistent with the \nproposed redactions requested by the Government on pages 158 to 159 and 163 of its opposition to the defendant's pre-\ntrial motions, which the Court granted on March 18, 2021. (Dkt. 168). \nReply \nBrief 10 \nThe Government agrees with the defense's proposed redactions to Reply Brief 10, which are narrowly tailored to cover \ninformation implicating the personal privacy interests of third parties and are consistent with prior redactions in earlier \nbriefing. The Government further agrees that Exhibit A to Reply Brief 10 should be filed under seal to protect the \npersonal privacy interests of the third party implicated in the document. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: on ay, pri , : \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: US v Maxwell - [conferrals regarding pretrial disclosures & redactions to replies] \nCounsel — \nI am writing to schedule a time for counsel to formally confer on two issues. \nFirst, we need to confer regarding the pretrial disclosure deadlines, as directed in the Court's Friday order (Dkt. 207 at \n34). Although we tentatively discussed some possible deadlines while we were together last week, the Court's opinion \nincludes other upcoming deadlines we did not discuss and we may need to adjust our proposals based on her opinion. \nSecond, we need to confer regarding redactions to the as yet undocketed Replies in support of our Pretrial Motions (Dkt. \n205). \nWe are generally available tomorrow (Tuesday) for a call. Please let me know a time that works from your end and I can \ncirculate a dial-in number. \nThanks, \nLaura \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This e-mail transmission, and any documents, files or previous e-mail messages \nattached to it may contain information that is confidential or legally privileged.
