Those are attached. We have since \ndone shorter update memos for the DAG, most recently in May. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 5, 2019 2:03 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Brass memos \nWould you mind sending us the final version of the most recent update memos on these investigations? I know in some \ncases they were part of a larger memo. I don't think we have the final draft in some instances. \nFrom \nSent: Monday, August 5, 2019 12:32 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Brass memos \nAll — \nGeoff has to brief the AG on various cases next week, to potentially include As of now we do not \nneed to do memos for the AG, but Geoff would like fairly meaty briefing memos on these matters. Some of them you \nhave already done, so they can be supplemented/revised as appropriate — find one of us to discuss or answer any \nquestions. We would like them from you by Wednesday if possible so that we can get them to Geoff by Thursday night or \nFriday. That sound okay? \nUnited States Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00022617\n\nEFTA00022618",
