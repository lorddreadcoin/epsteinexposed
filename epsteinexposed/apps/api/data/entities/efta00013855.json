Lelkowitz, P.C. \nTo Call \nWrit r \nit \nctly: \nYnyw.kirkland.com \nJune 19, 2009 \nVIA FEDERAL EXPRESS \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of Florida \nRe: \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nDear \nFacsimile: \nI  appreciate your letter of June 17, 2009. I  sincerely hope that any and all issues \nthat \ncould generate an adversarial relationship between Mr. Epstein and the United States Attorney's \nOffice are in our past. Like you, we hope that the ongoing, complex, and at times vigorous \nlitigation will not again require your involvement, nor result in any belief on your part that any \nlegal position taken by Mr. Epstein's counsel conflicts with the Non-Prosecution Agreement \n(\"NPA\"). \nIn order to avoid future misunderstandings, however, I  would like to have a  discussion \nwith you specifically about our ongoing obligations as you understand them under the NPA. As \nyou know from past experience, and as Mr. Acosta previously acknowledged in letters to my \npartner Ken Starr (on December 4, 2007) and Lilly Ann Sanchez (on December 19, 2007), the \nlanguage of ¶ 8 is \"far from simple,\" and, in certain respects, subject to significant ambiguity. \nI  believe it  is both necessary and appropriate to seek immediate \nclarification from the \ngoverment about its understanding of a few \nprovisions in the NPA. It is likely by no fault of our \nown that \nthese issues will come before a judge or an independent third party, whose job it \nwill be \nto interpret the intent of the parties. In those circumstances, I think the court would \nmost likely \nturn to both of us \nand directly seek our views, as the drafters of the agreement, before \nrendering \nits own opinion. Therefore, I  believe it \nwould bring about the finality that we both seek in a \nmuch \nreduced time frame if we could discuss several of the \nmore ambiguous provisions \ncontained in the NPA. \nChicago Hong \nKong \nLondon Los Angeles \nMunich San \nFrancisco \nWashington, D.C. \nEFTA00013855\n\nJune \n19, \n2009 \nPage 2 \nOne specific example comes to mind. First, we clearly \nunderstood during the course of \nnegotiating the NPA, and believe that both the language of the NPA \nand our prior \ncorrespondence \nwith your Office confirm, that the \nwaiver \nof \nliability set forth in Paragraph 8 at \nmost was designed to allow an identified individual the right to assert a  single \nviolation of a \nsection 2255 predicate. The waiver of liability does not embrace situations where a particular \nplaintiff asserts multiple violations. Thus, compliance with paragraph 8's waiver of liability \nwould require at most that Mr. Epstein stipulate to the existence of a \nsingle enumerated predicate \nthat would entitle an otherwise eligible plaintiff to actual damages (or the \napplicable statutory \nminimum damages \nwhere actual damages fall short of that floor), leaving aside the issue of \nwhether the waiver is applicable to contested litigation or only the cases where there would be \nagreed damage resolutions. In addition, if we believe that a  predicate act is time-barred, as \nindeed we understand was the case with respect to all such acts in relation to one plaintiff, a \nproper construction of the waiver of liability would not preclude the reliance on a  statute of \nlimitations defense. \nGiven your Office's prior acknowledgements that the language of the NPA is far from \nclear, we very much would appreciate an opportunity to discuss Paragraph 8 with you in the very \nnear future in order to clarify a  few pivotal questions raised by the NPA. I  assure you that \nMr. Epstein intends to abide fully by the terms of the NPA. And it is my sincere hope that our \ndiscussion can avert future \nrisks that anything we do will cause you to believe that there has \nbeen \na breach \nof the NPA. \nFinally, I \nenclose a letter in response to your June 15 letter in order to provide you \nwith \nour \nperspective on the issues you raised. I hope our differing views on certain \nevents over the \npast several years as reflected in my letter will not \nin anyway divert us from a common goal of \nhaving Mr. Epstein \ncomplete his NPA obligations without further tension \nwith your Office. \nSincerely, \nP. \nJay P. Lefkowitz, P.C. \nEnclosures \nEFTA00013856",
