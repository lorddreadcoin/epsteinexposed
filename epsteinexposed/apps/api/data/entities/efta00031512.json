Not sure we would ever plan to do so, but was trying to preserve the option. \nThat said, if this is the language of the treaty, not sure how hard we can push back. \nFrom: USANYS) \nSent: Friday, June 26, 2020 3:27 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Following up Witness PA \nI think that's OK. Note that Touhy is not entirely discretionary—it applies after a subpoena issues, and our denial \ncan be reviewed in court. But we can easily insist on a court order. At the beginning of the 302 (and any notes) \nthe following should be stated: \nNote that for purposes of any FOIA request, subpoena/Touhy request, Privacy Act routine use \ndisclosure, or any other disclosure this document is subject restrictions on disclosure pursuant to \nthe MLAT pursuant to which the interview took place.

Once the evidence \nis provided they typically send a letter to us saying that the evidence is to be used only for the \npurposes specified in the MLA request.

I appreciate the concern and am open to working to address it, to the extent possible. We, of course, \nwould never simply turn this material over to a civil litigant, as you suggest. The problem is, irrespective of our intent, \nthis is not Rule 6 material (unless, of course, he testifies before a grand jury), and we are trying to be mindful of not \nsimply our criminal case, but obligations we may have under other aspects of U.S. law, FOIA and/or Touhy, spring to \nmind, for example. Again, we never voluntarily turn this stuff over, and we frequently oppose FOIA requests and the like \nto the extent we can under the law. But particularly given the history and concern, we don't want to make promises we \nmay not be able to keep. \nDo you by any chance have handy a copy of the MLAT itself (if not, certainly happy to locate myself, just figured you \nmight have it already).

I've now had a chance to raise your suggestion on our end, and we are amenable to \ndiscussing a confidentiality agreement along the lines you propose, with some revisions. Below is our proposed \nlanguage which we would be comfortable with. Happy to discuss our position further at your convenience. ThanksM \nPrior \nto the in-person interview: \n- From now until August 14, 2020, neither the witness nor any person representing him will \nmake any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the plans for or terms of the \ninterview. Likewise, the SDNY agrees to \nmake no public comment about the matter during \nthis period. If an interview has not been concluded by August \n14, this confidentiality \nagreement will not bar any further public or private \ncomments on the matter. \nAfter an in-person interview: \n- If the witness completes an interview with U.S. law \nenforcement, both parties may confirm \npublicly or privately that: \"the witness has met with law enforcement authorities in the \nUnited States and answered questions about matters under \ninvestigation. We will not \ncomment further.\" Further comment by the \nwitness or any person representing or speaking \nfor him will void this agreement. \n- The content of the witness's statements \nto law enforcement as part of any interview arranged \npursuant to the MLA will only be used or disclosed as \npermitted under U.S. law, including in \nconnection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, as ordered or authorized by a court in \nthe United States, or as otherwise \nrequired by law. \nNothing in this agreement will bar any party \nfrom disclosing to a Court any communications related \nto setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview. \nFrom (CRM) < \nSent: Tuesday, June 23, 2020 5:00 AM \nTo: \n(USANYS) < \n; \nEFTA00031515\n\nCc: \nSubject: RE: Following up \nSounds good. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Monday, June 22, 2020 10:06 PM \nTo: \n(CRM) <=\nw; \nCc: \nSubtjec : o  owing up \nThanks, I am in the process of raising this internally on our end, but given recent events, and as I'm sure you can \nimagine, it make take me a bit more time than usual to get back to you. I can tell you the conditions below are unlikely \nto be acceptable to us as drafted, but provided it is in fact a rough outline, I am working on some proposed \nmodifications that folks here may be able to get comfortable with. I will circle back when I know more. \nFrom: \nRM) \nSent: Monday, June 22, 2020 6:50 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Following up \n(USANYS) \ndc) \nBefore this weekend's events, I was planning on writing an email proposing that you put \ntogether \nsome very specific terms for an in-person interview that we can share with the Home Office and the \npolice force which makes the first formal approach to the witness's solicitors. Most of the \nterms are \nalready noted in the MLA request: who will be present, where it will take place (UK), whether it will \nbe recorded or written, etc. What isn't covered is any kind of a description or agreement about \nconfidentiality. Absent this, a MLA police interview will get \nhung up like your efforts at a voluntary \ninterview. \nThis \nweekend's events, which are troubling on many levels, also provide an opportunity in this case. \nBlackfords's and the witness's anger have been focused on your former USA's public statements. \nThey may now have some greater confidence that they can rely on any statements of confidentiality. \nOr at least they can now save face by \nagreeing to an interview. In any event, given the history of \nthis, I think \nabsent a mutual agreement on confidentiality, this matter will get mired in litigation, and \nyou may \nnever get the interview. \nHere is a rough outline of what might be \nacceptable on confidentiality. This may give you \nheartburn, but I think it is the most expeditious way \nforward: \nPrior to the in-person interview: \n- An agreement that for a period lasting no longer than eight (8) weeks, \nneither the witness nor \nany person representing him will make any \nstatement to anyone (other than counsel) about \nthe plans for or terms of the interview. \nLikewise, the USDOJ agrees to make no public \ncomment about the matter during this period. If an interview has not been concluded within \neight weeks, this confidentiality \nagreement will not bar any further public or private \ncomments on the \nmatter. \nAfter an in-person interview: \n- If the witness makes a statement, both parties may confirm publicly or privately that: \"the \nwitness has provided a formal statement to law \nenforcement authorities in the United States \nEFTA00031516\n\nabout matters under investigation. Further comment would not be \nappropriate.\" Further \ncomment by the witness or any \nperson representing or speaking for him will void this \nagreement. \nThe content of witness's statement will be treated in the same manner as testimony taken \nbefore a Federal Grand Jury under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Among other things, unless used in \nconnection with a criminal proceeding, required to be disclosed in connection with a criminal \nproceeding, or \notherwise ordered disclosed by a court in the United States, the content of the \nstatement \nwill not be made public. \nNothing in this agreement will bar any party from \ndisclosing to a Court any communications related \nto setting up or \nexecuting the interview or the contents of the interview. \nPutting something like this together will pave the way for getting the interview done. \nThanks, \nU.S. Department of Justice Attaché \nUnited States Embassy -  London \nV.K.
