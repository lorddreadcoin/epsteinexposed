Sony to hear that. \nI won't bother you with every inane observation, but I sure felt like Graydon Carter could have written a better \nstatement than the one they show at the end of episode 1; \"We thought we'd lose a lawsuit if we published it,\" \nnot exactly a profile in courage. \nSent from my iPhone \n> On May 29, 2020, at 4:08 PM, <ta \nwrote: \n> Yeah I  totally agree with your initial thoughts, and you'll have to let me know what you think if you keep \nwatching. \n> And yeah, it's unfortunate especially because if COVID wasn't an issue, I think we'd be really close to making \ndecisions on the other folks! But no way we can move forward even in the next month or two with all this going \non (and our subjects not being ongoing threats to public safety, obviously). \n> \nOriginal Messa e \n> From: \n'aIMME> \n> Sent: Frida Ma 29 2020 13:55 \n> To: \nc\nIMIN> \n> \nSubject: Re: Epstein \n> Thanks so much! I'm really interested in your insights. I'm almost through the episode and find the pacing to \nbe a little tedious, possibly foreshadowing that they made what should be a short series into a long one. (And \nI've seen a couple of reviews suggesting something similar.) \n> I would imagine you guys aren't super excited about the renewed energy (and pressure) the anniversary will \nbring. There's definitely a buzz in the air.
