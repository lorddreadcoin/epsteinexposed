I would like to see again at some point, and I think will want to \nsee as well. But hopefully this should permit you to get the relevant section to OIA in the morning. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, March 7, 20218:16 PM \nTo: \nSubject: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nChiefs, \nHope you both had a nice weekend. Attached for your review is a draft of our opposition to the third bail application, also \nattached for your convenience. As noted in the draft, we are still waiting on feedback from OIA re France so that section \nis subject to change. We also plan to send the section on citizenship renunciation to OIA to make sure they review for \naccuracy (as we did with our last opposition). Given the time difference and our filing deadline of Tuesday, we are hoping \nto send this to them sometime tomorrow morning, but of course, happy to discuss. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nEFTA00018720",
