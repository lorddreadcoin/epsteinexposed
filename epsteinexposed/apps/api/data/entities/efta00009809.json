As set forth herein, over \nthe course of many \nyears, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually \nexploited and \nabused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New .\nYork, and Palm Beach, \nFlorida, among other locations. \n2. In \nparticular, from at least in or about 2002, up \nto and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and \nrecruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New \nYork \n(the \"New York Residence\") and his estate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida (the \"Palm Beach Residence\") to engage \nin sex acts with \nhim, after which he would give \nthe victims hundreds of dollars \nin \ncash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his \nsupply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to \nrecruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In \nEFTA00009809\n\nbase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 2 of 14 \nthis way, \nEPSTEIN created a vast network of \nunderage victims for \nhim to \nsexually exploit in \nlocations including New York and \nPalm Beach. \n3. The victims \ndescribed herein were as young as 14 \nyears old at the time they were \nabused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, and \nwere, for various reasons, often particularly \nvulnerable to \nexploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out \nminors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the \nage of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims \nexpressly told him their age. \n4. in creating and \nmaintaining this network of minor \nvictims in multiple states to \nsexually abuse and exploit, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, worked and \nconspired with \nothers, including \nemployees and \nassociates who \nfacilitated his \nconduct by, \namong other things, \ncontacting \nvictims and \nscheduling their \nsexual \nencounters with \nEPSTEIN at the \nNew York \nResidence and at the \nPalm Beach \nResidence. \nFACTUAL \nBACKGROUND \n5. \nDuring all \ntime \nperiods charged \nin this \nIndictment, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, \nwas a \nfinancier \nwith \nmultiple \nresidences in \nthe \ncontinental \nUnited States, \nincluding \nthe \nNew York \nResidence and \nthe Palm \nBeach \nResidence. \n6. \nBeginning \nin at \nleast 2002, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nenticed and \nrecruited, \nand caused \nto be \nenticed and \nEFTA00009810\n\nt \nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 3 of 14 \nrecruited, dozens \nof minor girls \nto engage \nin sex acts \nwith him, \nafter \nwhich \nEPSTEIN paid \nthe victims \nhundreds \nof dollars \nin \ncash, at the New \nYork \nResidence and the \nPalm Beach \nResidence. \n7. In both New \nYork and \nFlorida, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe defendant, \nperpetuated this abuse in \nsimilar ways. Victims \nwere initially \nrecruited to provide \n\"massages\" to EPSTEIN, \nwhich \nwould be \nperformed nude or partially \nnude, would become \nincreasingly \nsexual in nature, and would \ntypically include one \nor more \nsex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars \nin cash for each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively \nencouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to \nbe similarly sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims \nto become recruiters by paying these victim\n-recruiters hundreds \nof dollars for each girl that \nthey brought to EPSTEIN. In so \ndoing, EPSTEIN maintained \na steady supply of new \nvictims to \nexploit. \nThe \nNew York \nResidence \n8. At all \ntimes relevant \nto this \nIndictment, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, \npossessed and \ncontrolled a \nmulti-story \nprivate \nresidence on the \nUpper East \nSide of \nManhattan, New \nYork, \ni.e., \nthe New York \nResidence. \nBetween at \nleast in or \nabout 2002 \nand \nin or about \n2005, EPSTEIN \nabused numerous \nminor victims \nat \nthe \nNew York Residence \nby causing these \nvictims to be \nrecruited \nto engage \nin paid sex \nacts with him. \nEFTA00009811\n\nT \nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 4 of 14 \n9. When a victim \narrived at the New \nYork Residence, \nshe typically would be \nescorted to a room with a \nmassage table, \nwhere she would perform \na massage on JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant. The victims, who \nwere as young as 14 years of age, \nwere told by \nEPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully \nundress before beginning the \"massage.\" During the encounter, \nEPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact \nwith his victim to include, \namong other things, sex acts such as \ngroping and direct and indirect contact with the \nvictim's \ngenitals. EPSTEIN typically would also \nmasturbate during these \nsexualized \nencounters, ask \nvictims to touch him while \nhe \nmasturbated, and touch \nvictims' genitals \nwith his hands or with \nsex toys. \n10. In \nconnection with \neach sexual \nencounter, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe defendant, \nor one of his \nemployees or \nassociates, \npaid \nthe victim in \ncash. \nVictims typically \nwere paid \nhundreds \nof dollars in \ncash for \neach encounter. \n11. \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, \nknew that \nmany of \nhis New \nYork \nvictims \nwere \nunderage, \nincluding \nbecause \ncertain \nvictims \ntold him \ntheir \nage. \nFurther, once \nthese \nminor \nvictims \nwere \nrecruited, many \nwere \nabused by \nEPSTEIN on \nmultiple \nsubsequent \noccasions at \nthe New \nYork \nResidence. \nEPSTEIN \nsometimes \npersonally \ncontacted \nvictims \nto \nschedule \nappointments \nat the \nNew York \nResidence. \nIn \nother \ninstances, \nEPSTEIN \ndirected \nEFTA00009812\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 5 of 14 \nemployees and \nassociates, \nincluding a New \nYork-based \nemployee \n(\"Employee\n-I\"), to \ncommunicate with victims \nvia phone to \narrange \nfor these \nvictims to \nreturn to the New \nYork Residence \nfor \nadditional sexual \nencounters with \nEPSTEIN. \n12. Additionally, \nand to further \nfacilitate his \nability to abuse minor girls \nin New York, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, asked \nand enticed certain of his \nvictims to recruit \nadditional girls to perform \n\"massages\" and similarly engage in \nsex acts with EPSTEIN. When a \nvictim would recruit another girl \nfor EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new \nvictim \nhundreds of dollars in \ncash. Through these \nvictim-\nrecruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse \ndozens of additional minor girls. \n13. In particular, \ncertain recruiters brought \ndozens \nof additional minor \ngirls to the New York Residence to give \nmassages to and \nengage in sex acts \nwith JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant. EPSTEIN encouraged \nvictims to recruit \nadditional \ngirls by \noffering to pay \nthese victim\n-recruiters for every \nadditional \ngirl they \nbrought to EPSTEIN. \nWhen a \nvictim-\nrecruiter \naccompanied \na new minor \nvictim to \nthe New York \nResidence, \nboth the victim\n-recruiter \nand the new \nminor victim \nwere \npaid hundreds \nof dollars by \nEPSTEIN for \neach \nencounter. In \naddition, \ncertain \nvictim\n-recruiters routinely \nscheduled \nthese \n5 \nEFTA00009813\n\n•• \nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 6 of 14 \nencounters \nthrough \nEmployee-1, who \nsometimes \nasked the \nrecruiters to bring \na specific \nminor girl \nfor EPSTEIN. \nThe \nPalm Beach \nResidence \n14. In \naddition to \nrecruiting and \nabusing minor girls \nin New York, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, created a \nsimilar \nnetwork of minor girls \nto victimize in Palm \nBeach, Florida, \nwhere EPSTEIN owned, \npossessed and \ncontrolled another \nlarge \nresidence, i.e., the \nPalm Beach Residence. \nEPSTEIN frequently \ntraveled \nfrom New York to Palm Beach by \nprivate jet, before \nwhich an employee or \nassociate would ensure that minor victims \nwere available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. \n15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, engaged in a similar \ncourse of abusive conduct. \nWhen a victim initially arrived at \nthe Palm Beach Residence, she \nwould be escorted to a room, sometimes \nby an employee of \nEPSTE1N's, \nincluding, at times, \ntwo assistants \n(\"Employee-2\" and \n\"Employee-3\") who, \nas described \nherein, were also \nresponsible \nfor \nscheduling \nsexual \nencounters with minor \nvictims. \nOnce \ninside, the \nvictim would \nprovide a \nnude or \nsemi-nude massage \nfor \nEPSTEIN, who \nwould \nhimself \ntypically be \nnaked. During \nthese \nencounters, \nEPSTEIN would \nescalate \nthe nature \nand scope \nof the \nphysical \ncontact to \ninclude sex acts \nsuch as \ngroping and \ndirect \nand \nindirect \ncontact with \nthe \nvictim's \ngenitals. \nEPSTEIN would \nalso \ntypically masturbate \nduring these \nencounters, \nask victims \nEFTA00009814\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 7 of 14 \nto touch \nhim while \nhe \nmasturbated, and \ntouch \nvictims' \ngenitals \nwith his \nhands or \nwith sex \ntoys. \n16. In \nconnection with \neach sexual \nencounter, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, \nor one of \nhis employees \nor \nassociates, \npaid the \nvictim in cash. \nVictims typically \nwere paid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars for each \nencounter. \n17. \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, knew that \ncertain \nof his \nvictims were underage, \nincluding because certain \nvictims \ntold him their \nage. In addition, as \nwith New York-based \nvictims, many Florida victims, \nonce recruited, were abused \nby \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional \noccasions. \n18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the \nrelevant time \nperiod was frequently in New \nYork, would arrange \nfor Employee-2 or other employees to \ncontact victims by phone in \nadvance of EPSTEIN's \ntravel to Florida to ensure \nappointments \nwere \nscheduled for when \nhe arrived. In particular, \nin certain \ninstances, \nEmployee-2 placed phone \ncalls to minor \nvictims in \nFlorida to schedule \nencounters at the \nPalm Beach \nResidence. At \nthe \ntime of \ncertain of those \nphone calls, \nEPSTEIN and \nEmployee-2 \nwere in New \nYork, New York. \nAdditionally, \ncertain of the \nindividuals \nvictimized at the Palm \nBeach Residence \nwere \ncontacted by \nphone by \nEmployee-3 to \nschedule these \nencounters. \n7 \nEFTA00009815\n\nCase \n1:19-cr-00490-RMB \nDocument \n2 \nFiled \n07/02/19 \nPage \n8 \nof \n14 \n19. \nMoreover, \nas \nin \nNew \nYork, \nto \nensure \na \nsteady \nstream \nof \nminor \nvictims, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nasked \nand \nenticed \ncertain \nvictims \nin \nFlorida \nto \nrecruit \nother \ngirls \nto \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts. \nEPSTEIN \npaid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nto \nvictim\n-\nrecruiters \nfor \neach \nadditional \ngirl \nthey \nbrought \nto \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence. \nSTATUTORY \nALLEGATIONS \n20. \nFrom \nat \nleast \nin \nor \nabout \n2002, \nup \nto \nand \nincluding \nin \nor \nabout \n2005, \nin \nthe \nSouthern \nDistrict \nof \nNew \nYork \nand \nelsewhere, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nand \nothers \nknown \nand \nunknown, \nwillfully \nand \nknowingly \ndid \ncombine, \nconspire, \nconfederate, \nand \nagree \ntogether \nand \nwith \neach \nother \nto \ncommit \nan \noffense \nagainst \nthe \nUnited \nStates, \nto \nwit, \nsex \ntrafficking \nof \nminors, \nin \nviolation \nof \nTitle \n18, \nUnited \nStates \nCode, \nSection \n1591(a) \nand \n(b)\n. \n21. \nIt \nwas \na \npart \nand \nobject \nof \nthe \nconspiracy \nthat \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nand \nothers \nknown \nand \nunknown, \nwould \nand \ndid, \nin \nand \naffecting \ninterstate \nand \nforeign \ncommerce, \nrecruit, \nentice, \nharbor, \ntransport, \nprovide, \nand \nobtain, \nby \nany \nmeans \na \nperson, \nand \nto \nbenefit, \nfinancially \nand \nby \nreceiving \nanything \nof \nvalue, \nfrom \nparticipation \nin \na \nventure \nwhich \nhas \nengaged \nin \nany \nsuch \nact, \nknowing \nthat \nthe \nperson \nhad \nnot \nattained \nthe \nage \nof \n18 \nyears \nand \nwould \nbe \ncaused \nto \nengage \nin \na \nz \n8 \nEFTA00009816\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 2 Filed 07/02/19 Page 9 of 14 \ncommercial \nsex act, in \nviolation of Title 18, \nUnited States \nCode, Sections \n1591(a) and (b)(2). \nOvert Acts \n22. \nIn furtherance of the \nconspiracy and to effect \nthe illegal \nobject thereof, the following \novert acts, among \nothers, \nwere committed in the Southern \nDistrict of New York and \nelsewhere: \na. \nIn or about 2004, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and \nrecruited multiple minor victims, \nincluding minor victims identified herein as \nMinor Victim-1, \nMinor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3, to engage \nin sex acts with \nEPSTEIN at his residences in Manhattan, New York, and \nPalm \nBeach, Florida, after \nwhich he provided them \nwith hundreds of \ndollars in cash for each encounter. \nb.
