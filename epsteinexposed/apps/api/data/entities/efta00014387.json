In terms of who would be in the room, the \nmost likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The \nonly reason I saw \"most likely\" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign \ncountry, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't \nbelieve that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's \nuseful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just \nthe case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're of \ncourse happy to travel to her.) \nRegarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team \nworking on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not \ngenerally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up \nthose notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I can \nalso check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. \nWith respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our \ninvestigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other \nwitnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't \nchange even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have been \nconnected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of course \nhappy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any follow-up \nvia email. \nthanks, \nFrom: Jill \nGreenfield \nSent: Saturday, February 08, 2020 13:17 \nTo: \nCc: Kyle Phillips Louise Scott \nc \nSubject: Re: Epstein investigation \nHi \nThanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any notes \nmade. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? \nAs you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to \nprovide any comfort on this? \nEFTA00014389\n\nMany thanks \nJill \nJill Greenfield \nPartner \nD:IMO\nM: \nPersonal \nInjury Team of the Year - Solicitors Journal Awards 2017 \nkimage001.jpgd \nSent from my iPhone \nOn 6 Feb 2020, at 21:53, \nMs. Greenfield, \n) < \n> \nwrote: \nThank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection with \nour investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. \nAs requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to \nreiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her \ntrauma or causing re-victimization. \nAs we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the U.K. \nmay be the \"suspect\" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any U.S. \nfederal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never spoken to \nher—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has been our \nexperience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey Epstein during \nthe relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble believing, that your \nclient was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we hope to speak with her. \nSeparately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends not \njust to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss particular \ntopics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would be \nbeneficial while we're meeting, etc. \nIn terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and \nhis other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked directly \nfor. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her employment, \nany instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and observations in \ninteracting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of the abuse she \nwas subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if she weren't \ncomfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. \nPlease let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us \nwould be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. \nRegards, \nEFTA00014390\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFieldfisher, Riverbank House, 2 Swan Lane, London EC4R 3TT. \nwww.fieldfisher.com \nWe do not intend to change our bank details.
