It's short and sweet. And also attaching the Government's brief on it. \nIt also looks like there may be another opinion on this issue that's currently under seal, but which is scheduled to \nbe made public on the 18th (according to the docket). I should still get the bounce on that when it's posted and \nwill send it along, too, if it's relevant. \n Ori inal Messa e \nFrom: (USANYS) alMIN> \nSent: Monda Au ust 16 2021 14:09 \nTo:\nSubject: Maxwell Opinion \nPlease can you send \nme the opinion you mentioned?
