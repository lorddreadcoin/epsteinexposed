The charges set forth herein stem from the role \nof GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation \nand abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In \nparticular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including \nat least in or about 2004, MAXWELL assisted, \nfacilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, \namong \nother things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately \nabuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age \nof 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were \ngroomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, \nboth of whom knew \nthat certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. \n2. As a part and in \nfurtherance \nof their \nscheme to \nabuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to \nEFTA00013398\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 2 of 24 \nEpstein's residences in different states, \nwhich MAXWELL knew and \nintended would result in their grooming for and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal \nher crimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned \nabout her conduct, \nincluding in relation to some of the minor victims described \nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. During the time periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a \npersonal and \nprofessional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his \nclosest associates. In \nparticular, between in or about 1994 and \nin or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with \nEpstein. Additionally, between in or about 1994 and in or about \n2004, MAXWELL was paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. \n4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nthe defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to \nengage in sex acts with \nJeffrey Epstein, through a variety of \nmeans and methods, including but not limited to the following: \na. MAXWELL \nfirst attempted to befriend some of \nEpstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by \nasking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their \nfamilies. MAXWELL \nand Epstein would spend time building \nfriendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor \n2 \nEFTA00013399\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 3 of 24 \nvictims to the movies \nor shopping. Some of these \noutings would \ninvolve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor \nvictim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending \ntime alone with a minor victim. \nb. Having developed a \nrapport with a victim, \nMAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim \nby, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in \nfront of the victim, being present when a minor victim was \nundressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor \nvictim and Epstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL'S \npresence during minor victims' \ninteractions with Epstein, including interactions where the \nminor victim was undressed or \nthat involved sex acts with \nEpstein, helped put the \nvictims at ease because an adult woman \nwas present. For \nexample, in some instances, \nMAXWELL would \nmassage Epstein in front \nof a minor victim. In other \ninstances, \nMAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized \nmassages during which a minor victim would \nbe fully or partially \nnude. Many of those massages resulted in \nEpstein sexually abusing the minor victims. \nd. In addition, Epstein offered to help \nsome \nminor victims by paying for travel and/or \neducational \nopportunities, and MAXWELL \nencouraged certain victims to accept \nEpstein's assistance. As a result, victims \nwere made to feel \n3 \nEFTA00013400\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 4 of 24 \nindebted and believed \nthat MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to \nhelp them. \ne. \nThrough this process, MAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed victims to \nengage in sexual activity with Epstein. In \nsome instances, MAXWELL was present for and \nparticipated in the \nsexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in \nthe context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. \n5. Between \napproximately in or about 1994 and in or \nabout 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other \nthings, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the \ninducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims \nwere groomed \nand/or abused at multiple locations, including the \nfollowing: \na. A multi-story private residence on the Upper \nEast Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the \"New York \nResidence\"). \nb. An estate \nin Palm Beach, Florida owned by \nEpstein (the \"Palm Beach Residence\"). \nc. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by \nEpstein (the \"New Mexico Residence\"). \nd. MAXWELL's personal \nresidence in London, \nEngland. \n4 \nEFTA00013401\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 5 of 24 \n6. Additionally, beginning at least in or about \n2001, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nthe defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein \nenticed and recruited, and caused \nto be enticed and recruited, \nminor girls to visit Epstein's \nPalm Beach Residence to engage in \nsex acts with Epstein, after \nwhich Epstein, MAXWELL, or another \nemployee of \nEpstein's would give \nthe \nvictims hundreds \nof \ndollars \nin cash. Epstein and MAXWELL encouraged one or more of those \nvictims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the \nvictim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order \nto \nmaintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein, \nMAXWELL, and other Epstein employees also paid certain victims \nto recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. \nIn this way, Epstein and \nMAXWELL created a network of underage \nvictims for him to sexually exploit. \n7. Between at least in or about 2001 and in or about \n2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Epstein \nencouraged \nand enticed one or more \nminor victims to engage in paid sex acts \nwith Epstein through a variety of means and methods, including \nbut not limited to the following: \na. Epstein's employees, including, at \ntimes, \nMAXWELL, would call a victim to schedule an appointment for the \nvictim to massage Epstein at his Palm Beach Residence. MAXWELL \nplaced at least some of those calls while with Epstein in \n5 \nEFTA00013402\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 6 of 24 \nManhattan, New York. Epstein would \noften travel from New York \nto Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments. \nb. When a victim initially arrived at the Palm \nBeach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee \nof \nEpstein's, including, at times, \nMAXWELL. The victim would then \nbe escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, \nthe \nvictim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, \nwho would \nhimself typically be naked. During these \nencounters, \nEPSTEIN would \nescalate the nature and scope of the \nphysical \ncontact to \ninclude sex acts such as groping and \ndirect and \nindirect contact with the \nvictim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also \ntypically masturbate during these \nencounters, ask the victim to \ntouch \nhim while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals \nwith his hands or with sex toys. \nc. In \nconnection with each sexual encounter, \nEpstein or one \nof his employees or associates, including, at \ntimes, MAXWELL, paid the victim in \ncash. Each victim was \ntypically paid \nhundreds of dollars for each \nencounter. \n8. GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey \nEpstein's access to minor victims knowing \nthat he had a \nsexual preference for \nunderage girls and that he intended to \nengage in sexual activity \nwith those victims. Epstein's \nresulting abuse of \nminor victims included, among other things, \ntouching a victim's breast, touching a \nvictim's genitals, \n6 \nEFTA00013403\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 7 of 24 \nplacing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, \ndirecting a \nvictim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and \ndirecting a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. \nMAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S \nVICTIMS \n9. Among the victims \ninduced or enticed by GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as \nMinor Victim-1, \nMinor Victim-2, Minor Victim-3, and Minor \nVictim-4. In \nparticular, and during time periods relevant to \nthis Indictment, MAXWELL \nengaged in the following acts, among \nothers, with respect to minor victims: \na. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor \nVictim-1 was \napproximately \n14 years \nold. \nMAXWELL \nsubsequently \ninteracted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at \nEpstein's \nresidences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the \nage of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took \nplace between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor \nVictim-1 to engage \nin sexual acts \nwith Epstein \nthrough multiple \nmeans. \nFirst, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor \nVictim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. \nMAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her \nfamily, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to \nnormalize inappropriate and abusive \nconduct by, among other \nthings, \nundressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present \nwhen Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of \nEpstein. Within the \n7 \nEFTA00013404\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 8 of 24 \nfirst year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein \nbegan sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was \npresent for \nand involved in some of this \nabuse. In particular, MAXWELL \ninvolved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized \nmassages of Epstein. \nDuring those group \nsexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor \nVictim-1 would engage in \nsex acts with Epstein. Epstein and \nMAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to \ntravel to Epstein's \nresidences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor \nVictim\n-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and \nFlorida. Minor Victim-1 was \nenticed to travel across state \nlines for the purpose of \nsexual encounters with Epstein, and \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in \nsexual activity with \nMinor Victim-1 after \nMinor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's \nprcperties, including \nin the context of a sexualized massage. \nb. \nMAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at \nleast one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's \nresidence in \nNew Mexico when Minor Victim-2 \nwas under the age of 18. Minor \nVictim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at \nEpstein's \ninvitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or \nsubjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor \nVictim-2 was under the age of 18 \nat the time. While in New \nMexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor \nVictim-2 to a movie and \nMAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. \nMAXWELL also discussed \nMinor Victim-2's \nschool, classes, and family with Minor Victim-\n8 \nEFTA00013405\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 9 of 24 \n2. In New Mexico, \nMAXWELL began her efforts to groom \nMinor \nVictim-2 for abuse by Epstein \nby, among other things, providing \nan unsolicited \nmassage to Minor Victim-2, during \nwhich Minor \nVictim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to \nmassage \nEpstein. \nc.

Among other things, \nMAXWELL discussed \nMinor Victim-3's life and family with Minor \nVictim-3.

During those \ninteractions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor \nVictim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage \nin sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor \nVictim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and \nduring those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with \nMinor \nVictim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when \nMinor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context \nof a \nsexualized massage. \nd. Minor Victim-4 was recruited to provide \nEpstein with sexualized massages \nfor which Minor Victim-4 was \npaid by Epstein and/or one of his associates, including, at \n9 \nEFTA00013406\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 10 of 24 \ntimes, MAXWELL, at the Palm \nBeach Residence beginning in or \naround 2001.

During these \ninteractions, which took place between approximately 2001 and \n2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts \nwith Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked \nMinor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. \nMAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive \nconduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in \nfront of Minor Victim-4 and \nbeing present when Minor Victim-4 \nwas nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach \nResidence. On \nmultiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Minor \nVictim-4 provided nude massages to Epstein at the Palm Beach \nResidence, during which Epstein engaged in multiple sex acts \nwith Minor Victim-4. Epstein's employees, including at times \nMAXWELL, called Minor Victim-4, including from New York, to \nschedule appointments for Minor Victim-4 to massage Epstein. \nAfter \neach massage, Epstein or \none \nof his \nemployees, \nincluding \nat times MAXWELL, paid Minor Victim-4 hundreds of dollars in \ncash.

On \nmultiple occasions between \napproximately 2001 \nand 2004, Epstein's employees, \nincluding at times MAXWELL, sent \nMinor Victim-4 gifts, including lingerie, from an address in \nManhattan, New York to \nMinor Victim-4's residence in Florida. \nEpstein and MAXWELL each also encouraged Minor \nVictim-4 to \nrecruit other young females to \nprovide sexualized massages to \nEpstein. In response, Minor \nVictim-4 brought multiple females, \nincluding girls under the age of 18, to provide sexualized \nmassages for Epstein at the \nPalm Beach Residence. On such \noccasions, both \nMinor Victim-4 and the girl she \nbrought were \npaid hundreds of dollars in \ncash. \nMAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT \n10.
