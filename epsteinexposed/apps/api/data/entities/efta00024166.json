NATHAN, District Judge: \nOn March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell submitted to the Court an application \nfor an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure. The proposed subpoena was directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of \nthe Defendant. As is standard for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and \nunder seal on the ground that it reveals defense strategy. See e.g., United States v. Skelos, No. \n15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d \nCir. 2021); United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v. \nEarls, No. 03-CR-0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2004); United States \nv. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). \nRule 17(c)(3) provides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the \nproduction of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party \nonly by court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional \ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to \nquash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with \nthe Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex pane Order, the Court required defense counsel to \nprovide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be disclosed \nEFTA00024166\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 172 Filed 03/24/21 Page 2 of 3 \nby the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or \nrequest modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). \nOn March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter from the law firm indicating that it can \nprovide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be elicited by \nthe subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. \nIn that letter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm \nand the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a \nmotion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive \nadversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm \nshall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v. Ray, \nNo. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) (\"[I]f the Court \ndetermines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential information about a victim, it \nrequires the requesting party have given notice to the victim before it permits the service of the \nsubpoena. If the victim objects, the Court will then determine whether to modify or quash the \nsubpoena, including on grounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). \nIn advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the law firm shall meet and confer with \ndefense counsel to see if any issues can be narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to \nfiling, the law firm shall confer with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored \nredactions to the objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be \nfiled on or before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. \nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing of \nobjections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply \n2 \nEFTA00024167\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 172 Filed 03/24/21 Page 3 of 3 \nwithin three days of the Defendant's response.' Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed \nredactions for all briefing. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: March 24, 2021 \nNew York, New York ALISON J. NATHAN \nUnited States District Judge \nI  All filings must be double-spaced and in  l2-point font with I -inch margins. \n3 \nEFTA00024168",
