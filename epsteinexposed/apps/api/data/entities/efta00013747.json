(USAFLS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein \nHere's our version that we plan to send to Lefkowitz. Alex and I have read your proposed \nletter to Judge Davis and other than parts of the last paragraph concerning \"consulting with \nthe victims\", it looks good. \n1. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility \nfor consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting \nthe attorney representative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the United \nStates elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, both the United \nStates and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney \nrepresentative suggested by the independent third-party prior to the final designation of the \nattorney representative. \n2.  The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party \nregarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to pay \nsuch attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing such \nvictims subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, infra. \n3. Pursuant to additional paragraph 1, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney \nrepresentative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not \nobligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if \nEFTA00013747\n\nafter consideration of potential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a \ncontested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested remedy, \nthe paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney representative, \nas opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs \nsuch as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall \ncease. \nFrom: \n(USAFLS) \nSent: Monda \nOctober 15, 2007 9:38 AM \nTo: \n(LISAFLS) \nSubject: Epstein \nHi M— I  have prepared this as a letter from you to Judge Davis.
