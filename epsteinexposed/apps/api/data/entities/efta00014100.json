I  have spoken with the Chief and he also spoke to the Sheriff about serving the time out at the jail. The Chief also is going to call \nsome victims to inform them that he received a call from the State Attorney's Office about a plea hearing on Monday. \nI am very surprised that there has been no press coverage. \nYes, can we meet on Monday morning. I  want to have the victim list ready to go before we head to the hearing in case we can get him to \nsign it right then and there. \n'Attorney \nFaxes \n----Original Messa \nFrom: \nSent: Sunda \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Notice of Non-Compliance \nJune 29.2008 11:54 AM \nJust wanted to let you knowliMand I are working on the remaining 5 girls and getting everything ready for al. Did you ever hear back \nfrom Jack Goldberger? I spoke with Joe yesterday and he agreed with Dave, that the PBC Detention Center is the jail. He also mentioned \nany sentenced under a year is served at the jail. If over that, Epstein will be serving at the Dept of Correction which is the Stockade. Joe \nalso mentioned that the Sheriff determines how the sentence is carried out. We have already met with the Colonel at the jail some months \nago. If all goes well tomorrow, we should ALL meet with the Colonel again just to reiterate our position. We have not heard from AMOC \nbut will let you know when we do. Give us a shout later today and let us know if you would like to meet us tomorrow morning prior to \ngoing to the courthouse. \nFrom: \nSent: atur ay, une _  , \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Notice of Non-Compliance \nDear Jack: \nI  have conferred with a state court practitioner who stated that there is nothing that prohibits you from agreeing to a consecutive six-month \nsentence of incarceration followed by one year of community control as specified in the non-prosecution agreement. \nIf you elect to proceed with the plea agreement as currently drafted, we ask that you insert the word \"imprisoned\" following the words \"six \nmonths\" in the second sentencing paragraph. \nPlease confirm that this change is acceptable. Thank you. \nEFTA00014100\n\n--- Original Message ----\nFrom: Jack Goldberger \nTo: \nCc: Jack Goldberger Inlifl \nSent: Sat Jun 28 08:49:55 2008 \nSubject: RE: Notice of Non-Compliance \nDear Ms Villafana, \nplease allow this e-mail to confirm our telephone conference of 6:30 pm on June 27 wherein we discussed the Epstein plea agreement and \nwe agreed that the Epstein state plea agreement was in compliance with the September 2007 non-prosecution agreement entered into \nbetween Mr. Epstein and the USAO for the Souhem District of Florida. \nJack Goldberger \nFrom \nSent: Fri 6/27/2008 5:45 PM \nTo: Jack Goldberger; Roy BLACK \nCc: \nSubject: Notice of Non-Compliance \nDear Messrs.
