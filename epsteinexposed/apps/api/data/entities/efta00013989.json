Fax\nI again want to thank you for this \nopportunity to explain why we believe that a federal \nprosecution of Jeffrey Epstein is unwarranted. I \nappreciate your having informed us that you \nalready have our May 19 and May 27 \ncommunications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well \nas our prior written submissions to CEOS and to the Southern District of Florida. \nIn light of the \nsignificant volume of our prior submissions \nand to facilitate your review, \nwe have drafted four \nsupplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your \ninvestigation of this matter. Given the \nbulk of these documents and their appended \nsupporting \nattachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of \nthe four submissions follows. First, \nI have included a succinct summary of the \nfacts, law and \npolicy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes \nour principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter \nis neither appropriate nor \nwarranted. \nThe three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that \noccurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney \nthat responds to CEOS's assessment of its limited rev's case; and a point-by-\npoint rebuttal to First Assistant United States Attorney recent letter which we \nbelieve contains factual \ninaccuracies typical of our correspondence from the United States \nAttorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\"). Also, for your reference, the package you receive \ntomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our \nsubmissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of \neach submission or substantive \ncommunication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to \nenhance your review. If there are \nany that you have not received from the \nUSAO \nor CEOS, \nplease advise and we will fedex them to you without delay. \nOtago Hong Kong London \nMunich \nNew York \nSan Francisco WasNngtom D.C. \nEFTA00013989\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nEsq. \nJune 19, \n2008 \nPage 2 \nAs you are \nlikely aware, the \nDepartment's prior review \nof this matter was \nincomplete \nand, by its own \nadmission, not \"de novo.\" See \nTab 38, May 15, 2008 \nLetter from A. \nOosterbaan. \nWithout \nconsidering the Non \nProsecution \nAgreement that left this \nmatter to be resolved \nin the \nState or \nany of the misconduct, \nCEOS reviewers, \ntasked with reviewing \nsome of their own \npreviously \nexpressed opinions, \nassessed only whether the \nUnited States Attorney \nwould \"abuse \n[his] discretion\" if he \npursued this case. \nWhile we appreciate \nCEOS's \nwillingness to examine \nthese limited issues, its \nconclusion that a \nprosecution would not be an \n\"abuse of discretion\" \nrings \nparticularly hollow in light \nof CEOS's admirably \ncandid concessions \nthat we have raised \n\"compelling\" \nobjections and that a \nprosecution on these \nfacts would require \n\"novel\" applications \nof federal law. \nIndeed, even a  brief \nreview of CEOS's own \nmission statement \nreveals how \ninapposite a federal \nprosecution is to the facts in \nthis case. \nImportantly, we note that \nthe CEOS review was \nconducted prior to the \nSupreme Court's \nvery recent \ndecisions in Santos and \nCuellar, which we \nbelieve—illuminating as \nthey do the \nCourt's \ninterpretive methodology \nwhen it comes to \nfederal criminal law\n—powerfully \ndemonstrate the \nsubstantive vulnerability of \nthe USAO's unprecedented \nemployment of three \nfederal laws. That \nOffice's interpretation would \nnever pass muster \nunder the Supreme Court's \nrecent pronouncements \nand should not be \ncountenanced. That is all the \nmore true under the \ncircumstances where \nthe duly appointed U.S. \nAttorney opined that, in effect, the \n\"unitary\" \nExecutive Branch was driving \nthis prosecution. We now \nknow that is not so. \nWhat I  respectfully \nrequest, and what I  hope you \nwill provide, is a  truly \n\"de novo\" \nreview that is, an independent \nassessment of whether federal \nprosecution of Mr. Epstein is both \nnecessary and warranted in view of \nthe legal and evidentiary hurdles \nthat have been identified, \nthe existence of a State felony \nplea and sentence that have been \nadvocated by the State Attorney \nfor Palm Beach County, and the many \nissues of prosecutorial misconduct \nand overzealousness \nthat have \npermeated the investigation. I \nalso request that you provide us \nwith the opportunity \nduring your \nreview to meet with you in person \nto answer any questions you may \nhave and to \nelucidate some of the \nissues in our submission. \nWe believe that an \nindependent review will confirm our \nstrong belief that federal \nprosecutors would be required to stretch the \nplain meaning of each element of \nthe enumerated \nstatutes, and then to combine these distorted \nelements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr. \nEpstein. Indeed, just this week iatufter two years of \nfederal involvement in this matter), \nAssistant United \nStates Attorney re-initiated the federal \ngrand jury investigation—in \ndirect contravention of the parties' Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another \nsubpoena seeking evidence in this \ncase. See Tab 19, Subpoena to \nIn the \nsubpoena, \nAUSA directs to appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony \nand produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm \nBeach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks \ndocuments such as \nphotographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information \nthat relate to Mr. Epstein as well as specific other people who received \nprotection from federal \nEFTA00013990\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS \nLLP \nEsq. \nJune \n19, 2008 \nPage 3 \nprosecution as a \nresult of Mr. Epstein's \nhaving entered into the \nSeptember 24, 2007 Non \nProsecution Agreement with the \nUSAO. \nNotably, the \nNon Prosecution \nAgreement contains the \nfollowing agreed condition: \nFurther, upon \nexecution of this agreement and a \nplea agreement with the State \nAttorney's Office, \nthe federal Grand Jury \ninvestigation will be suspende4 \nand all pending federal Grand \nJury \nsubpoenas will be held in \nabeyance unless and until the \ndefendant violates any teen of this \nagreement. The \ndefendant likewise agrees to \nwithdraw his pending motion to intervene \nand to \nquash certain grand \njury subpoenas. \nSee Tab 21, \nSeptember 24, 2007 Non Prosecution \nA reement. It  also uarantees th \nidentified in the \nGrand Jury subpoena such as \nand \nand others will not \nbe prosecuted. The new \nGrand Jury subpoena clearly \nviolates the Non-\nProsecution \nAgreement. Although Mr. Epstein \nhas exercised his rights to \nappeal to the \nDepartment of Justice with \nthe full consent and knowledge of \nthe USAO, he has not breached \nthe \nAgreement. The re\n-commencing of the Grand Jury \nis in violation of the Agreement. \nBut further, the new \ninvestigation, which features a \nwide-ranging, fishing-expedition type \nto \nsearch in New York does nothing \nto satisfy the very essential \nelements of federal statutes that \nare \nlacking despite the intensity of an \nover two-year investigation in \nthe Palm Beach area. \nAbsent \nevidence of Internet luring, \ninducements while using the phone, travel for \nthe purpose, \nfraud or coercion, \nthe subject of the New York \ninvestigation is  as lacking in the essential basis \nfor converting a state case into a \nfederal case as is the remainder of \nthe Florida investigation. \nThe reaching out to New \nYork to fill the void emanating from the \nfailures of the Florida \ninvestigation compellingly demonstrates \nthe misuse of federal resources in an \noverzealous, over-\npersonalized, selective and extraordin attempt to \nexpand federal law to where it  is  has never \ngone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. \nar einforces our belief that the \nUSAO does not have \nfacts \nthat, without distortion, would justify a \nprosecution of Mr. Epstein. \nIn \nview of the prosecution's often-verbalized desire to \npunish Mr. Epstein, we believe \nthat the prosecution \nsummary suffers from critical \ninaccuracies and aggregates the expected \ntestimony of \nwitnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our \ncontention is reinforced by the \nfact that key prosecution witnesses \nhave provided evidence and \ntestimony that directly \nundermines the prosecution's \nmisleading and inaccurate summ of its case. \nIndeed, we now \nhave received statements from three \nof the principal \naccusers \n(through a state \ncriminal deposition , (through \na federal FBI-USAO sworn and transcribed \ninterview), and (through a  defense\n—generated sworn transcribed interview). \nEach of these witnesses \ncategorically denies each essential element \nthat the prosecution will have \nto prove in order to \nconvert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter. \nEFTA00013991\n\nKIRKLAND & \nELLIS LLP \nEsq. \nJune 19, \n2008 \nPage 4 \nIt thus is \nespecially troubling that the USAO has not provided us with the transcript of \nMs. s federal interview, nor the substance of the \ninterviews with Ms. or Ms. \nnor \nany information generated by interviews with any of the \napproximately 40 alleged \nwitnesses that the prosecution claims it  has identified. Because the information \nprovided by \nthese women \ngoes directly to the question of Mr. Epstein's guilt or innocence, it is classic Brady \ninformation. We understand \nthat the U.S. Attorney might not want to disclose impeachment \ninformation about their witnesses prior to a charge or during \nplea negotiations. But we firmly \nbelieve that when the Government possesses information that goes directly to a \ntarget's factual \nguilt or innocence, the \ntarget should be informed about such heartland exculpatory evidence. \nMost importantly, aside from whether the \nDepartment believes Brady obligates \ndisclosure to a target of a  federal investigation prior to the target's formal \naccusation, no such \nlimit should apply to a Department review. Accordingly, we request that you go beneath the face \nof any summary provided to you by the \nUSAO \nand instead review the actual witness transcripts \nand FBI 302s, which are essential for you to be \nable to make a truly independent assessment of \nthe strength and wisdom of any federal prosecution. \nAfter careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply \ndo \nnot believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr. \nEpstein's personal wealth and publicly-reported ties to former President Bill Clinton. A simple \nInternet search on Mr. Epstein reveals myriad articles \nand news stories about the former \nPresident's personal relationship with Mr. Epstein, \nincluding multi-page stories in New York \nMagazine and Vanity Fair. Mr. Epstein, in fact, only came to the \npublic's attention a few years \nago when he and the former President traveled for a  week to Africa (using Mr. Epstein's \nairplane)—a trip that received a great deal of press coverage. I cannot imagine that the \nUSAO \never would have contemplated a  prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein lacked this type of \nnotoriety. \nThat belief has been reinforced by the significant prosecutorial impropriety and \nmisconduct throughout the \ncourse of this matter. While we describe the majority of these \nirregularities in another submission, two instances are particularly \ntroubling. First, the \nUSAO \nauthorized the public disclosure of specific details of the open investigation to the New York \nTimes—including descriptions of the prosecution's ti  shn   of the case and specific terms of a plea \nnegotiation between the parties. Second, AUSA \nattempted to enrich friends and close \nacquaintances by bringing them \nbusiness in \nconnection \nwith this matter. Specifically, \nshe \nattempted to appoint a close personal friend of her live-in boyfriend to serve as an attorney-\nrepresentative for the women involved in this case. \nIt also bears mentioning that actions taken by FAUSA present an appearance of \nimpropriety that gives us cause for concern. Mr. 's former law partner is currently \npursuing a handful of $50-million lawsuits against Mr. Epstein by some of the masseuses. \nEFTA00013992\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nsue. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nFinally, as you know, \nMr. Epstein and the \nUSAO entered into \nan agreement that \ndeferred \nprosecution to the \nState. In this \nregard, I sprite \nthat the manner in \nwhich this \nagreement \nwas \nnegotiated contrasts \nsharply with \nMr. s \ncurrent representation \nthat \"[The SDFL \nindicated \na willingness to de \ner to the State the \nlength of \nincarceration . . . \" See Tab \n1, May 19, \n2008 \nLetter fro.. p. 2. \nThis statement is \nsimply not true. \nContrary to \nMa's \nassertion, federal \nprosecutors refused \nto accept what \nthe State believed \nto be \nappropriate as to \nMr. Epstein's \nsentence and instead, \ninsisted that Mr. \nEpstein be required \nserve a two-year term \nof \nimprisonment (which \nthey later decreased \nto 18 months \nplus one year of \nhouse arrest). \nFederal \nprosecutors \nhave not only \ninvolved themselves in \nwhat is \nquintessentially a state matter, \nbut their \nactions have \ncaused a critical \nappearance of \nimpropriety that raises \ndoubt as to their \nmotivation \nfor investigating \nand prosecuting Mr. \nEpstein in the first \nplace. \nAt bottom, we \nappreciate your \nwillingness to \nreview this matter \nwith a  fresh—and \nindependent—set of \neyes. To facilitate \nyour review, I \nonce again request \nthe opportunity to \nmake an oral \npresentation to supplement \nour written \nsubmissions, and we will \npromptly respond \nto any \ninquiries you may \nhave. \n1111111\n1___ \nKenneth W.
