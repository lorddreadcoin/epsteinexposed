Nathan \nUnited \nStates District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley \nSquare \nNew York, NY 10007 \n80 29h Street \nBrooklyn, New York 11232 \nA1;21\nALISON J. NATHAN \nUnited States District Judge \nRe: \nUnited States v. Ghislaine \nMaxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(AJN) \nGhislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. 02579-509 \nDear Judge Nathan: \nUSDC SONY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY \nFILED \nDOC  \nDATE \nFILED: \n2/2/21 \nHaving considered the request \nsubmitted by the Bureau of Prisons \n(\"BOP\") that the Court vacate its \nJanuary 15, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 117, \nas well as the Government's and the \nDefendant's responses, Dkt. Nos. 129, \n130, the Court hereby DENIES the \nBOP's request to vacate the Order. \nSO ORDERED. \nThis letter is written in response to Order granted on January 15, 2021, concerning Ghislaine \nMaxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center \n(\"MDC\") \nin \nBrooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given \nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel's claims, although the objection \nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Attorney's Office numerous times. \nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell's confinement limiting her \naccess to discovery. However, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her \ndiscovery. On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms. \nMaxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permitted to use that \nlaptop to review her discovery for thirteen (13) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the \nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel \nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic \ndiscovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense \ncounsel's claim that Ms. Maxwell's lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of \nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn's discovery computers undercuts this claim. \nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three \n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this is far more time than any other MDC \ninmate is allotted to communicate with their attorneys. \nEFTA00028163\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 13/ Filed 02/02/21 Page 2 of 3 \nWe respectfully request that Your Honor vacate the order of January 15, 2021, and allow the \ninstitution to resume the prior schedule of laptop access, Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM — 8:00 PM. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/5/ \nStaff Attorney \nMDC Brooklyn \nFederal \nBureau of Prisons \nEFTA00028164",
