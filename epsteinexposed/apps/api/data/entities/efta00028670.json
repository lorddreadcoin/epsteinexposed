If there are two or three that we have had \ngood experiences using, in Fort Lauderdale, Miami, or wherever, I can forward that contact information and leave the rest to them to sort out. Does \nthat make sense? \nThanks for looking into this. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, September 1, 2020 11:18 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n).; \nSubject: RE: Copy/Scan Vendors \nCurrently, we do not have a contract in place for large/voluminous jobs. We use our Simplified Purchase Agreement (SPA) vendors for any job that \ncan't be handled in-house. Normally, these SPA vendors don't have storage space in their facilities to hold discovery past a brief period, and the \ncopy/scan jobs are small to medium. There are no restrictions for folks outside of our district on who they can use. If the request is being paid by \nanother district, they are free to go wherever they like. To help with the process, I can try to find a few SPA vendors in the WPB area. Then SONY can \ncall them to ask if they can handle the job; about their security (confidentiality) protocol; and pricing information. \nAnother option may be to send the documents to the NOC. I don't know a lot about the process but we've used it in the past, and it's secure. If \ninterested in this option, I can discuss with our in-house Graphics Dept. \nQuestions: \nIs there a deadline of when the documents are to be scanned/copied? \nAre the original or copied documents going to opposing counsel to review? \nWill the vendor be required to store the documents to allow defense to view/copy? \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, September 1, 2020 10:36 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n).; \nSubject: Copy/Scan Vendors \n> \nGood \nMorning \nI hope all is \nwell. \nThe USAO — SDNY is requesting a list of vendors that we've used (I don't believe we have a current contract) for copying and scanning voluminous \nfiles/documents/cd's and cassette tapes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Obviously, confidentiality and sensitivity are major concerns. \nI believe that SDNY will make the arrangements and pay for the services, but they are requesting a list of vendors that SDFL has used for these types \nof services. Since we do not have a current contract, is there policy that needs to be followed to use a company in this field? \nIf memory serves me, I don't believe any of the companies were local to West Palm Beach (where the documents are being stored). I believe the \ncompanies were in the Fort Lauderdale and Miami area. \nAny information, assistance and guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you and take care, \nOffice Manager, WPB \nEFTA00028671",
