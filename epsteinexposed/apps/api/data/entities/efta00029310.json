    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nSubject: Epstein Related \nDate: Thu, 12 Sep 2019 14:50:36 +0000 \nDo you have a few minutes today or tomorrow to discuss something? Specifically, a good friend of mine is the executive \nproducer on a 4-part Netflix series that will come out in a few months on Epstein (they had been working on the story for \n18 months before we charged). He had spoken to at one point (not sure how that worked!) and wants to see \nif anyone from the office would give an interview, all backward looking. I imagine the answer is no but they are going with \nthis regardless, so thought I would at least make you and potentially chiefs aware of it. Wanted to start with you. I'm free \nbetween now and noon or after 6pm tonight, or tomorrow morning or after lunch. Thanks! \nEFTA00029310",
