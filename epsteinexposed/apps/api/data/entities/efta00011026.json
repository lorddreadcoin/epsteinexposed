BERMAN \nUNITED STATES \nDISTRICT JUDGE \nBruce A. Green \nLouis Stein Chair \nFordharn University \nSchool of Law \n150 West 62\"d Street \nRoom 7-168 \nNew York City, \nNY 10023 \nDear \nProfessor Green, \nUSDC \nSDNY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY \nFILED \nDOC \nIt: \nDATE \nFILED: \nI \nSeptember 4, \n2019 \nThank you for your letter of \nAugust 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify \nthe record. \nI learned that you had \nbeen \"retained to provide \nopinions as an expert on legal \nethics\" in \nv. Dershowitz following the August 27, \n2019 public hearing in US v. Epstein. I learned \nof your role in theaase by reading \nyour affidavit, dated June 7, 2019, which includes \nyour legal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from representing Ms. \nin that matter. As you are aware, both Mr. Boles and Ms. \nwere invited to \ntestify at the \nAugust \n27, 2019 hearing. \nI remain surprised that your \nadvocacy of Mr. Boles' disqualification \nfrom representing \nMs. Guiffre (in a case \nobviously related to US v. Epstein) was not \ndisclosed simultaneously with \nyour \nAugust 26, 2019 Law Journal opinion \npiece entitled \"The Judge in Epstein's Case \nShould \nNot Tum the Dismissal Into a Drama for the \nVictims.\" I am also surprised that you would find \nthe \nAugust 27, 2019 public hearing to be \nan inappropriate occasion for \ntransparency in light of \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57 and the \nCrime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. \nYou wrote: \"This is an odd moment for \ntransparency in a criminal case.\" \n1 \nEFTA00011026\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 56 Filed 09/04/19 Page 2 of 2 \nFinally, it  is unfortunate that your opinion \npiece may have been construed as an effort \nto \nchill Ms. a \nand Mr. Boies' right to \nbe heard under 18 \nU.S.C. § 3771 at the August \n27, \n2019 \npublic hearing. You wrote: \n\"[W]hatever informational interests the \nvictims may have \nwould be served by \naffording them a \nchance to attend the \nhearing, not by giving them a \nspeaking \nrole.\" \nSincerely. \nRichard M. Berman \nU.S.D.J. \ncc: AU Martin G. \nWeinberg, Esq.; \nReid Weingarten, Esq.; David Boies, Esq. \n2 \nEFTA00011027",
