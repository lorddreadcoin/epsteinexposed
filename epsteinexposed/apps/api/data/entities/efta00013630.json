Marine; \nSenlees \nDAN SHORTER \nGeneral Masagn, PabuliraeliPostcom \nHow \nwill system judge \nPalm \nBeach predator? \nWe soon will find out whether \nbig money can buy \nfrom the crimi-\nnal justice system \nwhat everyone \nassumes that big money can buy. \nThe penalty news reports say \npart-time Palm Beach resident \nJeffrey Epstein is \nexpected to \nface \nsuggests that he \nwiD plead \nguilty \nto \nsomething more than one felony \ncount for solicitation of \nprostitution. \nA Palm \nBeach County grand jury \nindicted the Manhattan money \nmanager \non that charge in July \n2006. But a guilty plea that does not \nrecognize the age of the girls whom \npolice say the \nbillionaire paid for \nsex would be \na  disservice to the \ngirls, an insult to the investigators \nwho \npressed the case \nand, for good \nmeasure, \na \ngeneral outrage. \nPalm Beach \npolice have said that \nJeffrey \nEpstein. 54, paid underage \ngirls, \none as young as 14, to come to \nhis 7,200-s\nquare-foot \nwaterfront home \nfor \"massage\" \nsessions. fblice said \ninterviews \nwith five alleged \nvictims \nand 17 \nwitnesses under oath, phone \nmessages, a  high school transcript \nand other \nitems they found in Mr. \nEpstein's trash and home show that \nhe knew how young the girls were. \nBut after \nMr Epstein's attorneys told \nprosecutors about the girls' \nMySpace \npages, which mentioned marijuana \nand alcohol use, State \nAttorney Barry \nKrischer sent the case to a grand jury. \ninstead of filing charges \nhimself \nBlaming these victims, \nhowever, \ndoes not \nmake them any \nmore de-\nserving of what \nhappened. And Mr. \nKrischer's \nunnecessary handoff to a \ngrand jury, \nafter an 11-month police \ninvestigation, \nmore than reinforced \nJeffrey Epstein case \ncomes \nto turning point. \nthe public \nunderstanding that \nthe more \nmoney the accused has, \nthe bigger the break he gets. Mc \nEpstein% legal team \nincludes West \nPalm Beach defense attorney Jack \nGoldberger, Harvard Law School \nProfessor Alan Dershowitz, who \nworked on the OJ. Simpson \nmurder \ncase, and Kenneth Starr, who once \npursued a  president based on \nhis \nlies \nabout sex with young women. \nFederal \nauthorities also stepped \nin, which stalled the state% case \nfor another year. On Nov. 9,  citing \nan unnamed source \nclose to Jeffrey \nEpstein, Jose Lambiet of The Post \nwrote that the federal \ninvestigation \nis over, and Mc Epstein is ex \nto serve up to 18 months an could \nbe labeled a sex offender in crimi-\nnal records. The charge the grand \njury returned more than a year ago \ncarries a maximum five-year prison \nterm and no \"sex offender label. \n\"This case,\" Mr. Goldberger told \nMr. Lambiet, \"is absolutely going to \nend without a trial within the next \ntwo months\" State attorney spokes-\nman Michael Edmondson \nwould \nnot confirm any plea deal. But, he \nnoted: 'The state attorney's hands \nare not tied by there being a single \ngrand jury charge. That does not \npreclude additional charges\" \nJeffrey Epstein, like too many \nmen in Florida. preyed \non teenaged \ngirls.
