Neither nor I will be at the office today or \ntomorrow. I plan on going in on Thursday and will be able to check on those issues that defense points out. Not to jump to \nconclusions but I believe that .DAT files typically include only the beginning number in a range which would give the \nappearance of gaps in the production. As such there is a decent chance that defense is incorrect about the gaps as they \nlist them although we will not know until we actually check the productions. \nThanks, \nWill \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, January 15, 2021 9:02 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: \nSubject: FW: Discovery Requests \nHi \nand M, \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nWould you please take a look at request number 6 below and figure out how to address it?

Cohen <\n>; Bobbi Sternheim < \nJeff Pagliuca \n >; \n'Laura \nMenninger' \nSubject: Discovery Requests \nand -\nWe write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest \nconvenience. \n1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery \nproduction. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. \nMaxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive \nwill be ready? \n2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the \nMDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to \ninclude the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December \n30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto \na separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she \ncan review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at \nthe MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you \nrequire to facilitate this production. \n3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does \nnot correlate the Bates numbers to the particular \"Subject Device\" from which the documents were recovered. \nInstead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from \"SDNY_PROD015\" or \"SDNY_PROD0167 We do \nnot know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates \nnumbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the \ndocuments were recovered. \n4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, \nbearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a  log \nidentifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. \n5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents \n(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, \nthe flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number \"Rodgers000028,\" suggesting that \nRodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an \nexplanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were \nremoved from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. \n6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: \na. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at \nSDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the \nrange from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). \nEFTA00030890\n\nb. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel \nfile. We propose that you send us a  new DAT file covering only the missing documents. \nc. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. \nWe propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. \n7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and \nNovember 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the \ndefense. \n8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the \ngovernment in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. \nThere is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit \nfor the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-\nthe-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein).  The article stated that the affidavit appeared \nin a  \"newly unsealed court filing.\" I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on \nthe court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the \ncriminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests. \nRegards, \nChristian R Everdell \nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \n+1 \n212 \n957 7268 \nceverdeilacohenciresser.com  I  view bio \nwww.cohengresser.com \nNew York I  Paris I  Washington DC \nI \nLondon \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this e-mail may be confidential and/or privileged.
