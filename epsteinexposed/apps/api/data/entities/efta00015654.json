Beyond the live feeds within the courthouse, the trial \nwill not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic dial-in to the proceedings. Victim access \nwill be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office Victim-Witness Coordinator,  \n), and Mr. Jose h Pecorino of the Court's District Executive \nOffice .  Victims who wish to attend the trial \nmay contact either one of those persons for further infonnation. \nCOVID-I9 Protocols. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-I9, anyone who appears at any \nS.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to entering \nthe courthouse.
