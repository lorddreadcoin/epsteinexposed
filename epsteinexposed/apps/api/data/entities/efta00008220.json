With your thumbs atop the \nshoulders and your fingers up on your part-\nner's back, knead thetops of the shoulders, also called the trapezius \nmuscles, as shown in Figure 11-4e. While \nyou're doing this, you can feel \nfor tight spots and then stop for a moment to apply pressure \nwith your \nthumbs directly on those areas. \n8. Switch your position to your partner's \nside. Then, using medium pres-\nsure, \nglide your hands up the back, separating them at your partner's \nshoulders and gliding back down with lighter pressure. Do this \ntwo or \nthree times, being careful not to press too hard directly over the spine. \n9. Reaching across your partner's back, drape your fingers over her side, \nthen pull back slowly, actually \nlifting her body up a tiny bit as you \nengage in a nifty \"reverse glide,\" as shown in Figure 11:4f. \n10. With \"small\" kneading movements, using mostly just \nthe fingers, reach \ndown and pull up the muscles along the back of the neck, alternating \none hand after the other, as shown in Figure 11-4g. You can \nbe firm, but \nbe careful not to pinch your partner. Also, make sure not to pull her hair \nwhen you're doing this maneuver. You should \nalso avoid reaching \naround too far with your \nfingertips because you mayend up in an endan-\ngerment site on the throat. \n11. Now is the time for you to really focus in on the tight spots you \ndiscov-\nered during your thumb glide down alongside the spine. Start at the \nbase of the spine and place your \nthumbs in the little groove that's \nformed \nbetween the spine itself and the erector spinae muscles that run \nup alongside the far side of the spine. Then press out toward the oppo-\nsite \nside of the back, moving your thumbs in a little reverse \"J\" motion \nover the muscle, as shown in Figure I1-4h. \n-Never press directly on the spine \nitself while you're doing this move. \nInstead, \nkeep \nyour \nthumbs pressing \naway from \nthe spine at \nall times. \nThe \nmain difference between a good massage and a mediocre one is that \na good massage is alwayS custom-made for each \nperson every time. So, \ncustomize \nthis maneuvertand apply itexactly where your partner needs \nit this time, seeking out the tight spots you flnd.during your \nearlier glid-\ning, and then concentrating on them. \n12. With \nyour partner's hand lifted onto her lower back, it's easy to see the \nshoulder blade, which automatically lifts up \nand reveals itself. A great \nway to \nrelease tension in this area Is to run your fingers along the lifted \ninner edge of the shoulder blade, \npressing in and down while you do so, \nas \nshown in Figure 11-5a. Sometimes you can feel the shoulder blade lift-\ning even further from the back as you relax the \nmuscles. \nEFTA00008221\n\n74 \nPart \nIII: The Art \nof Giving \nMassage \nFigure 11-4: \nA series of \nback moves \nto \nget you \nstarted. \n_.---,_ \ntt\nilk - \n!\nA\ni \ngib \n13. Use your \nthumbs to zero in on the spot that lies about \nmidway out.from \n• the spine at the level of the \narmpit. It's right at the base of the inner \nedge-of \nthe shoulder blade, and is usually tight \non almost everyone. If you can find \nthis spot and do a \nthumb press with firm pressure for 10 \nseconds or longer, \nyou may feel the entire shoulder \n\"fall\" away from the back in relaxation. \nS.\nEFTA00008222\n\n• \nChapter \n11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves \nTogether \n•: \n-r \nKnots, \nand \nwhat \nto \ndo \nwith \nthem \nt  . \nt' \nAs \nyou.get \nused \nto \nglidimaver-peoples \nbogies \ndecide \nwhen \nenough \nis \nenoughAind \nmov&onto \nwith \nyour \nhands, \nyouniqMicLify \nrealize \nthatno \n\"the \nnextaree. \nThis \nisa.toughtapecatise \nyour \ntwobodies \nare \nthe \nsame \nand\n-\nthat, \nin \nfact, \nthe \npartner's \nknots \nancI\nn\nsate \nspots \nare \nthe \nareasthat \nsame \nbody \ncan \neven \nfeel \ndifferent \non \ndifferent`' \nneed \nthe \nmost \nattention. \ndays. \nEventually, \nyou'll \nknow \nhow \nto \ndistinguish \na \n\"knot\" \nfrom \nan \narea \nof \nnormal \nmuscle \ntone. \nTh\nenyou \ncan \napply \nthe \ntechniques \nyou \nfind \nin \nthis \n.chapter \nand \nChapter \n10 \nto \nstart \nrelaxing \nthosqlight \npikes. \n• \n• \nYou \ncould \nellSi.brntild\n \nan\n-\nentire \nhour \njustdeal-\ning \nwith \nyout \nI:Mane\n/\nYe  \nknots, \n.so \nyou \nhave \ntot \n\\  \n,/ \n• \nO1 \nIn \ngeneral, \nduring \na \nfull \nbody \nmassage, \nspendflo \nmote \nthen \n5 \nminutes \non \nany \nparticulapigntspot \nIf \nyou \nwqnttnfocus \non \nit \nmore \ntoter, \nschedule \na \nspecielnession \njust \nfor \nthat \npurpose. \n, \n• \n:  \n• \no \n• \n•• \n• \nA\n \n; \nI.\n:,.: \n.\n..''...t \n;' \n.,‘ \n.• \n-- \n..• \n'• \n• \n14. \nTap \nall'ac.rotsthOp \n-spine; \naashowt\n-\nth.Fr \n. \nthe \nbadk, \nand' \nd9. \npi \n....\n1.\n..  \n.   \nscii\n.\nnSimeinisiupte:iiierealini \n•usis-OPIR \nh\nut \niqy \n- \n‘7\n,  \nto \nbrigage \nIn \nsonlefticfi \nI \n... \n-loobe \nfist \n.pounding \nire \nA\n \nH41\n.\n1 \n- \n  \n4\n \nspots,ii\nd:\nrfici \n111 \nT\n•\n. \ne \nr\nR\na\nj\nor \n  \ns \nA\nt\ne\n    \nout \no  \nthe \n• \nIs. \nAfter \nyotiptess \nan \nlb.°\nl\nc \nt.\n. \nback \narea, \nbut \ntO \ndo \nrt. \ntt\ni\nci'ritage \nyour.exit \ntoo \no \n;lest \nkou \n• \n—  \nshock \nyogi \npartner• \n&cause \nsudde\ns\nitsbackmnssage \nvili \n?w\ne\nal \ne\nx\ntnp-\ntoms. \nSo \n'take \nyour \nOepartmerom \nthe \nback \na:gradual. \none \nand \nuse \ngliding \nconhective \neitOkes. \nSeetheteidebar, \ntr4atjhg \nwholeness\" \nlater \nIn \nthis \nchapter. \n• \nii \n- \n.   \n   \n• \n. \n' \n' \n:•:,,, \n,.• \nFigure \n11-5: \nMore \nmoves \nfor \nthe \nback. \n'tapping \nthis \nifol \ndirt\n% \n• \n••••• \n4! \n. \n' \nt \n' \n'. \n.C.I. \n• \n- \n- \n' \n' \n. \n• \n. \n. \n. \n. \n.\" \n• \n- \n4;•.4: \n,  \n1 \nCititlullif'avoltt \n(lie \n2\n0\n,4\n1-#.\n16\n \n114\n1\n.0\n1\n.414\n5\n4 \n1\n \nnil \n.1b: \n'V'.\n‘, \nIffecds\n.\n.good; \nbut \n(find \nIt \n!,' \n.\n44\n,  \n. \n.ehttifalfe \nntappage. \nOnly \nh\n  , \n, \nc.\ng. \ne's7qhciuttiljtA \nor\nof. \ntable(' \n,1\n\"\n,\nV \n. \n..9theofsp, \nlic1F.towSmetatts \ngggli \n• \nI \n.C4\n4\n01§1hIPPriotkelcartike \n4\n1\n301\n0la\nnt\n'' \n•  \n4\nf,\nAlkbittatidigeth \ny°:,•: \n, \n•:y•-; \nr\n \n• \n-\n\";\nV: \ni \n.1 \nEFTA00008223\n\n776 \nPart III: The Art of Giving \nMassage  \n0 \nCreating \nwholeness \nYou \n?an create a  better experience for \nyour \npartner \nif younever really \"finish\" one part of \nthe body. Because, if you finish, \nthat means the \nclock is ticking, and the massage is slowly \ndrip-\nping away. It's better to create the illusion of \ntimelessness by connecting all the \npieces of the \nmassage \ntogether into one whole. \nSo, after you \n\"finish\" the back, that doesn't \nmean you shouldn't allow \nyour hands to move \nthere again. In \nfact, it's a good idea to add some \n\"connective strokes\" \nthroughout the massage \nso that it \nfeels ai though you \nnever completely \n,  finish with any \nparticular part of the body. You \ncan even \nconnect the front of the body to \nthe \nback by reaching•beneath \nyour partner during \ncertain \nmoves; as you sealaterin this \nchapter. \na\nNrckof \nthe legs and \nbuttocks \n• • \n• \n• \n' \n• \nThe \nbuttackj \ndatttaih \nth'elargest Ascle in the human \nbody, and they do a \n• \nlarge pefcsntage of the woilt.

Take a \nlook at the \"Limp \narm experiment\" in Chapter 7 for a. 'rider \non how to \ndo this. \nBe careful \nnot to press too hard directly on the upper \nridges of the heel \nbone right behind the \nanklebones, because it is a sensitive area and may \nbe uncomfortable for your \npartner. \n3. Before \nyou put your partner's foot back down, do some gentle \nshaking \nmovements, using the foot as a \n\"handle\" to move the leg, as shown In \nFigure 11-6b. \nThis can help relax the muscles of the entire \nlimb, right up \n0 \n0 \nEFTA00008224\n\n \nChapter \n11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves \nTogether \n177 \ninto \nthe \nJoints, \nin \nthis \ncase \nthe \nknee \nand \nhip. \nPractice \nuntil \nJust \nusing \na \ngentle \nshaking \nat \nthe \nfoot \ncan \nproduce \na \nrhythmical \nmovement \nthrough-\nout \nthe \nbody \nup \nto \nthe \nhead. \n4. \nThe \nlargest \nmuscle \nin \nthe \ncalf \nis \nactually \nseparated \ninto \ntwo \n\"bellies.\" \nIt \nfeels \ngreat \nto \nrun \nyour \nthumbs \nor \nthe \ntips \nof \nyour \nfingers \nup \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nthe \ncalf, \nseparating \nthe \ntwo \nsides, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n11.6c. \nYou \ncan \nalso \nmake \na \nstraight \nline \nup \non \neither \nside \nof \nthe \nmiddle. \n5. \nWhile \nyou \nknead \nthe \ncalf \nmuscle \nwith \na \nback \nand \nforth \nmotion, \nmove \nyour \nhands \nup \nand \ndown \nalso, \nso \nyou \ncover \nthe \nentire \nmuscle, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n11-6d. \nStop \nabout \nof \nthe \nway \ndown \nfrom \nthe \nknee \nbecause \nthe \ncalf \ntapers \ndown \nto \nthe \nAchilles \ntendon \nthere \nand \nbecomes \ntoo \nthin \nto \nknead. \nAt \nthat \npoint, \nyou \ncan \ncontinue \nby \nsqueezing \nthe \ntendon \nbetween \nyour \nthumb \nand \nfingers \ndown \nto \nthe \nankle. \n6. \nGrasping \nthe \nleg \nJust \nabove \nthe \nankle \nwith \nboth \nhands, \nuse \nthe \nwebbing \nbetween \nyour \nthumbs \nand \nforefingers \nto \ncreate \na \ntight \nseal. \nThen \nsqueeze \nin \nand \npush \nup \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime, \nmoving \nslowly, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n11-6e. \nStop \nwhen \nyou \nreach \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nknee. \nWith \nthis \nmaneu-\nver, \nyou \ncan \nactually \nhelp \nmove \nstagnant \nblood \nout \nof \nthe \nlimb, \nimproving \ncirculation. \nIf \nyou \ndo \nit \ncorrectly, \nthis \nmove \nmay \nincite \nyour \npartner \nto \nsay \nsomething \nlike, \n\"Whoa, \nthat's \nintense!\" \nTake \nthis \nas \na \nsign \nthat \nyou're \ndoing \nthings \nright, \nbut \nalso \nmake \nsure \nthat \nyou're \nnot \nsqueez- \n. \ning \ntoo \nhard. \nThere's \na \nfine \nline \nbetween \nintense \nand \npainful. \nRemember \nto \napply \nonly \nvery \nslight \npressure \nover \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nknee! \nAnd \nbe \ncareful \nto \navoid \nany \nvaricose \nveins. \n7. \nMaking \nyour \nhands \ninto \nfists, \napply \npressure \nwith \nthe \nknuckles \ninto \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nupper \nlegs, \ncalled \nthe \nhamstrings, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n11-6f. \nKnuckling \nis \na \nforth \nof \ngliding \nthat \nis \nespecially \nappropriate \nto \nthis \narea \nbecause \neach \nknuckle \nslides \nbetween \nthe \nlong \nbands \nof \nmuscles \nhere. \n8. \nThis \nmove \nfeels \nlike \nan \nice \ncream \nsundae \nfor \nthe \nleg \nmuscles. \nKnead \nfrom \nthe \ntop \nof \nthe \nleg \ndown \nto \nthe \nknee, \nmoving \nup \nand \ndown \nthree \nto \nfour \ntimes. \nTo \nmake \nthis \nmove \nmost \neffective, \ntry \nkeeping \nas \nmuch \nof \nyour \nhand \nin \ncontact \nwith \nthe \nskin \nas \npossible \nas \nyou \nsqueeze, \nroll, \nand \npush. \n9. \nDepending \nupon \nhow \nbig \nany \nparticular \nbuttock \nis, \nyou \nhave \na \nvariety \nof \nchoices \nof \nwhere \nto \npress, \nbut \nto \nbe \nmost \neffective \nyou \nhave \nto \nfind \njust \nthe \nright \nspot. \nIn \norder \nto \ndo \nthat, \npalpate \nthe \nouter \nupper \nedge \nof \nthe \ntailbone \n(sacrum), \nand \nthen \ngo \nstraight \ndown \ntoward \nthe \nleg \nhalf \nway \nacross \nthe \nbuttock. \nThis \nshould \nbe \nright \nin \nthe \nmiddle. \nPress \ndirectly \nin \nhere \nwith \nthumbs, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n11-6g. \nUse \nyour \nfingers, \nfist, \nor \nelbow \nat \nan \nangle \nperpendicular \nto \nthe \nsurface. \nHold \nthis \nmove \nfor \n5 \nto \n10 \nseconds. \nThis \nmove \nis \nparticularly \nbeneficial \nfor \nsciatica \npain. \nEFTA00008225\n\n175 Part III: The Art of \nGiving Massage \nTurning over \nIn my opinion, not enough is said about the art of \nturning over \nduring massages. Often, this turn is \nthe only physical effort a massage recipient has \nto make for over an \nhour. And, as it comes right \nin the middle of the experience, there's a poten-\ntial for it to be \ndisruptive and a little jarring. For \nthese reasons, most massage pros \nare quite \ngentle with their \nclients when it comes time for \nthem to turn. In a soft, soothing voice, they \nsay \nsomething like, \"All right Mr. Smith, I'm \ngoing to \nask you to gently roll over \nonto your back now. \nTake your time.\" \nYou have to \nwatch your wording carefully \nbecause there are those who take what \nyou say \ntoo literally. I  have one client who is a world-\nclass athlete, and once when \nI asked him to \"flip \nover,\" he literally flipped, \nspringing a foot off the \ntable \nand twisting over in midair \nto come crash-\ning back down on \nthe table, splintering one of \nits wooden legs. \nWhen it \ncomes time for your own partnerto \nturn \nover, follow the \nexample of the pros: \n;•••• Be gentle \npo Speak softly \nLeo Give them as much time as they \nneed \nye \nAssist them if necessary, offering \nsupport \nmor Use the \nwords \"roll over or \"turn gently, \nplease\" instead \nof \"flip\" \n10. Knead the \nthick muscles of the \nbuttocks, \nparticularly \non the upper, \noutside portion, which often \ntends to be the most sore, as shown \nin \nFigure 11-6h. You have to watch where your \nfingers are going while you \nsqueeze, roll, and push \nhere, though! It's kind of a \ntight area to work in. \nNO/ \n11. Because the buttocks \ninclude the largest muscles in the body, they can \nwithstand some heavy percussion \nmovements. Use loose fists and firm \npressure, but be \nsure not to pound with your fists on the \ntailbone, which \nis much more delicate. Then move the \ntapping down the leg, opening \nyour fists so \nthat you're doing karate-chop moves. \nRemember to lighten \nup over the \nback of the knee! \n12. Apply \nlight fingertip brushing up the back of the leg and onto the back, \nthen \nback down again. After pummeling, pressing, \nsqueezing, and knead-\ning your way across your \npartner's back, fingertip brushing is a really \ngood \nway to remind your partner how nice you \nare. You can extend the \nmove from the feet all the \nway to the head. \nAfter \nyou finish the \nfirst leg, switch to the \nother leg \nand \nrepeat. \nRemember, because you already connected the back with \nthe first leg, \nyou want to do some connecting \nstrokes when you begin the second leg \nas \nwell. So, make your initial gliding on the second leg go up \nand over \nthe \nbuttocks and onto \nthe lower back. \nEFTA00008226\n\n \nChapter \n11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves \nTogether \n779 \nFigure \n11-6: \nGiving \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nlegs \na \nkick \nin \nthe \npants. \nfilfr-\nmile \nMS \n-IN \nEFTA00008227\n\n180 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage \nFace and scalp \nAfter \nyour partner has turned over, you are presented with entirely different \nterrain to massage. The front of the body is a little more perplexing. There \nare \nmore intricate surfaces to deal with, as well as more private, vulnerable, \nand \ndelicate areas. \nTherefore, you need to be more of a \ndiplomat \nwhile \nmas-\nsaging the front of someone's body. Most people allow Just about anyone to \ngive them a backrub, but when it comes time for you to touch the front of \ntheir body, they have to trust \nyou. \nThe face, for example, is quite a private area. Although it's exposed to the \nworld for all to see, it's not there for all to touch. You have to be sensitive as \nyou begin to massage your partner's face. Avoid large gestures, or quick \nmovements. All of your maneuvers here, including those you make before \nyou even touch your partner, should be smooth, deliberate, and slow. \nYou probably don't need any extra oil for the face. The \noil \nleft over on your \nhands from massaging the back is sufficient. \n1. Start by placing your hands gently on the \nside of your partner's head, \nthumbs resting on the \nforehead. This is the perfect position from which \nto start massaging the forehead with some thumb gliding and firm circu-\nlar rubbing. \nFirst, glide your thumbs out from the middle toward the \nsides, \nstarting low by the brow, making three to four lines progressively \nhigher. Then begin making circles with your thumbs, as shown in Figure \n11-7a, all across the forehead. \n2. Leaving your hands In about the same position, begin using the finger-\ntips instead of the thumbs. \nCircle your fingertips into the side of the \nhead around the spot where \nsideburns would start if your partner had \nsome, as shown in Figure 11-7b. \n3. Using the tips of your first two fingers, trace around the edges of the \nbones that surround the eye — across the brow, down along the nose, \nand around the top of the cheek \nbones, as shown in Figure 11-7c.

Take the muscles on top of your \npartner's shoulders between your \nthumbs and fingers, kneading with a good amount of pressure, as shown \nIn Figure 11-8f. As your fingertips reach \ndown beneath your partner's \nback, curl them \nup so you're applying pressure in that area at the same \ntime. \n7. Now that the neck and shoulders are warmed up and relaxed, use some \npinpoint pressure with your thumbs to zero in on the tight spots you find, \nas shown In Figure 11-8g. Remember to keep a straight line from your \nelbows and shoulders \nto your \nthumb so you don't \nstress your \njoints. \nTo create a smooth transition, finish the neck and shoulder area with \nanother shoulder swoop. Then move down onto your partner's left \nshoulder and arm with a long flowing glide, which leaves you in position \nto begin massaging the hand. \nFigure 17-a \nTaking the \nburden off \nsomeone's \nshoulders. \nEFTA00008232\n\n Chapter 11: Putting the Moves Together \n7 \n55 \nArms and \nhands \nArms and hands are some of the most active parts \nof most people's bodies. \nThink about it. Even couch potatoes use their arms and hands to reach for \nthe \npotato \nchips and \nopen cans of \nbeer. In \nfact, \nJust \nabout \neverybody is so \nused to doing things with their arms and hands that, at first, you may find it \nchallenging to \nget your partner to \"let go\" in this area (see the \"Limp arm \nexperiment\" in Chapter 7 for help in getting your partner to \"let go\"). \nHowever, this doesn't mean that you can't perform some spectacularly bene-\nficial and pleasurable massage moves here. \nThe secret of good arm and hand massage is to make your moves smaller and \nto focus on the little details. Every pinkie \nfinger counts! \nA typical reaction you may get when you begin massaging in \nthis area is, \"I \ndidn't know my arms were so sore until you started doing that!\" Good mas-\nsage techniques can put vitality back into this active, expressive part of your \npartner's anatomy. \n1. Your initial gliding in \nthis area spreads the oil, of \ncourse, \nbut it \nalso \ndoes \nmuch more. At this time, you help your partner \"let go\" and loosen up. \nYou \naccomplish this by offering some support to the limb at the wrist \nand elbow while you're gliding. This means you're actually picking the \narm up and supporting it with one hand while gliding with the other. \nPractice switching hands with this lift-support-glide maneuver until you \nget fluid with it. \n2.  Begin kneading the palm. You've \nalready picked up your partner's hand, \nso you're in the perfect position for this move. You can flip your part-\nner's hand up and down to work at different angles, spreading open and \nsqueezing between the bones \nof the palm. \n3. You have to build up a little dexterity in your fingers in order to get this \nknuckle rolling technique down. One at a time, curl your fingers closed \ninto a fist then open them back up again over your partner's palm, as \nshown \nin Figure 1I-9a. \n4. Squeeze each \nfinger as you \npull \nslightly at the \nsame time, \nmoving up \nfrom the base of the finger to the tip, as shown in Figure 11-9b. Make \nsure to rub the sides of the fingers as well as the tops and bottoms. \n5. The pressure point in the webbing between one's thumb and index \nfinger is especially good for helping to \nrelieve headache pain. The best \nway to massage it is with direct pressure from your thumb, as shown in \nFigure 11-9c. Hold this pressure point, pushing in toward the bones of \nthe hand, for approximately 5 seconds. \nEFTA00008233\n\n1 \n56 \nPart III: The \nArt of Giving Massage \n6. This little move feels \nsurprisingly good. While holding your partner's \nhand palm-down, you apply circular rubbing over the top of the wrists, \nas shown in Figure 11-9d. For serious wrist problems such as carpal \ntunnel syndrome (CST), see Chapter 13. \n7. The forearms are jam-packed with muscles all crying out for attention. In \nthis move, you use your thumbs to trace lines straight up the forearms \nfrom the wrists to the elbows, as shown in Figure 11-9e. This is a deep \ngliding that is meant to sink down between the \nbands of muscle in this \narea. \nThere are special massage moves for the forearm that are effective on \ntennis elbow, and you can find out about them in Chapter 16. \n8. Your kneading movements on the forearms are basically a smaller ver-\nsion of the ones you used on the legs, but this doesn't mean they aren't \njust as effective. Try to get as much of the muscle tissue \nbetween your \nthumb and fingers as possible, and remember to involve your whole \nbody in the movement, all the way down to your hips, as shown in \nFigure 11-9f. \n9. \nWith your partner's elbow bent and \nresting on the ground for \nsupport, \nencircle the arm at the wrist with both \nof your hands, creating a tight \nseal around the entire circumference. Then begin pushing up the arm \nvery slowly until you reach the elbow, maintaining firm pressure the \nwhole time. This \"squeezing toothpaste through a tube\" glide is great for \ntired, achy arms that need some renewal. \n10. In order to massage the entire upper arm from one simple position, lift \nyour partner's arm up, supporting it at the elbow, allowing her hand to \nfall back toward the floor near her head. Then use your free hand \nto \nmassage the upper arm. For example, in Figure 11-9g the left arm is sup-\nported by your left hand, allowing the right hand to massage the biceps. \nIn Figure 11-9h, your right hand supports the elbow, \nleaving the left hand \nfree to massage the triceps. \nAs you're doing this move, make sure to keep track of where your part-\nner's hand is. If you're banging it against the side of her head, it detracts \nfrom the pleasure of the experience. \nThis is a perfect position for stretching the upper arm and chest, too, \nand you find instructions on how to \ndo just that in Chapter 16. \n11. Grasping your partner's hand \nnear the wrist, shake \nthe whole arm gently \nuntil you can see some \nmovement way up at the shoulders, neck, and \nhead. Try positioning her arm at three different angles to achieve a dif-\nferent stretch on the \nshoulder joint: down by her side, out at a 90-degree \nangle, and up by her head. \nEFTA00008234\n\nChapter \n11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves Together 757 \n12. Finish the \narm with a light fingertip glide that \nfloats up over the shoul-\nder to the chest, where \nyou're going to massage next. \nRepeat \nthis sequence on the \nopposite arm. \nRgure11-t \nTaking up \narms \nagainst a \nsea of \ntroubles. \nratrt\nlE \nty, \nEFTA00008235\n\nSS Part III: \nThe Art of Giving \nMassage  \nTorso \nAs a \nspecies, we've taken a big collective \nrisk by standing erect on two feet \nand exposing our \ndefenseless underbellies to the \nworld. The front of your \nbody, especially the abdomen, can \nbe a very vulnerable area, \nand you have to \nbe extra \nsensitive when applying massage \nmoves here. \nYour abdomen is the physical \nhome of many emotional realities such as \nfear, \nanger, and \nIntuition. That's why we say we have a \"gut \ninstinct\" about some-\nthing. You're not just \nmassaging a stomach when you place your hands on \nyour \npartner's belly. You're massaging her soul. This \nfact has been recog-\nnized by many Asian \ncultures, such as the Japanese, for \nexample, who have \neven given this soul-in-the\n-belly \na name: the \nKara. \nMake your movements on the chest \nand abdomen gentle at first, until your \npartner \nrelaxes a little and allows you to massage more \ndeeply. Keep in mind \nthat your touch here penetrates \nto the deepest layers, both physically and \npsychologically. \n1. Place your thumbs across your \npartner's upper chest muscles below the \ncollar bone, with your fingers reaching down toward his \nsides, as shown \nin Figure 11-10a. Begin some \nkneading, which, as you soon discover, is a \ntricky maneuver to perform without causing \nyour partner to squirm and \nwrithe in fits \nof hysterical giggling. Yes, this area can be quite ticklish. \nStart out gingerly, like a kitten pawing a \npillow, then gradually intensify, \nalways staying within your partner's comfort level. \nThis \narea can be extremely sensitive, especially on \npeople who exercise \na lot or who are overly \nticklish. Be careful not to poke your fingers \ninto \nyour partner's ribs or armpits. And make \nsure to use extra oil if your \npartner \nhas a lot of chest hair. \n2. Lifting your \nhands off the chest Just slightly, begin pressing back down \nby using pinpoint pressure of the thumbs along \na line about two inches \nbelow the collar \nbone, as shown in Figure 11-10b. This can have a \nbenefi-\ncial effect on your partner's breathing, \"opening\" \nthe upper ribcage. \n3. Placing your fingertips near the top of the \nbreastbone, push in gently \nand then begin \ncircular rubbing as you move slowly down \ntoward the \nabdomen, as shown in Figure \n11-10c. As your fingers skim over the edges \nof the breastbone on either side, you find \nridges and valleys where the \nribs attach. \nMake a small circle in each one of these valleys, too, as you \nmove down. \n4. Gliding on the abdomen not only spreads oil and \nrelaxes muscles; it also \naids digestion. \nYour large intestine runs clockwise starting on the lower \nright-hand portion down by your hip bone, up along your side, across \nEFTA00008236\n\n Chapter 11: Putting the Moves Together \n189 \nthe base of your ribs, and down your left side. When you massage in this \nsame direction (clockwise), you're helping the digestive organs do their \nJob. Press in with firm but sensitive pressure so your \nmovements affect \nthese organs as well as the muscles on top of them, as shown in \nFigure 11-10d. \nWhen \nyou get \nreally good at \ncircling \nyour hands over \nthe belly, try \nspeeding up your movements a little by letting your left hand glide right \nover the top of the \nright each time they cross paths, without pausing to \nlift the left hand up. This creates a smoother flow for you and a neat sen-\nsation for your partner. \n5. Right around the navel, in the pit of the belly, is where people often store \npent-up emotions. By gently touching several points here, applying just \nthe softest pressure inward, as \nshown in Figure 11-10e, you can help \ncoax the emotions out. It's possible that your partner may sigh with \nrelief or even begin to cry when you press here \nwith sensitivity and com-\npassion. This is a good time to offer nonjudgmental support and perhaps \neven \nsuggest a positive \nimage, or visualization, your partner can \nfocus \non. See the sidebar, \"Visualize whirled peas,\" later In this chapter. . \n6. This move offers a chance to massage the lower back while your partner \nis lying face up, and it's a nice \nstretch, too. Slide both hands over the \nwaist until the fingertips slip down all the way to meet at your partner's \nspine. Then curl the fingertips up to apply a little pressure as you simul-\ntaneously lift the whole lower back a fraction of an Inch upwards and \nglide your hands back toward the abdomen, as shown in Figure 11-10f. \nRepeat this move three times. \nDuring this move, make sure you're not putting too much strain on your \nown back. Position yourself close \nto your partner's side, and use your \nlegs and \nhips to do the lifting. \n7. Finish the abdomen with a glide that swoops around your partner's side \nat the hipbone, onto the front of the legs, and then down to the feet. \nFront of the \nlegs \nand feet \nThink of how many miles your feet and legs \nhave put in for you, selflessly \nhanging around beneath the rest of your body, taking you everywhere you \nwant to go, seldom asking for anything \nin \nreturn. The average person doesn't \nrealize how great a good leg and foot massage feels, and so you can surprise \nyour partner with \nthe simple, effective techniques in this section. \nYou finish the full \nbody massage on the legs and feet because this is where \nwe stand, literally. Ending here leaves your partner feeling more grounded \nand \"down to earth.\" \nEFTA00008237\n\n190 \nPart III: The \nArt of Giving \nMassage  \nFigure 11-10: \nTorquing the \ntorso. \nFeel free to \nspend some extra \ntime on the feet. \nAlthough the full \nfoot massage \nisn't described \nuntil Chapter 14, you \ncan incorporate \nmany of those moves \nhere as well. \n1. \nBegin by pushing in \nwith both \nthumbs on the bottoms \nof your partner's \nfoot \nand then \"spread\" the \nsole open as you \nmove your thumbs \nout \ntoward the \nside, as shown in \nFigure 11-11a. Use \nfirm pressure and \nrepeat \nthis move \nthree times. \n2. By using the \nthumb on the sole and \nforefinger on top of \nyour partner's \nfoot, \nrub between the long \nbones of the foot, as \nshown in Figure \n11-11b. \nYou should find \na \"groove\" between \nthe bones that you \ncan easily slip \nyour finger into. \nMake sure to \npress sideways, \nas well as \nInwards, against the \nfoot bones. \n3. \nHolding the top \nof your partner's \nfoot In one hand, \nuse the knuckles \nof \nthe \nother hand to \"rake\" \ninto the arch of \nthe foot in a \ncontinuous one-\nknuckle-at-a\n-time movement, \nstarting with the \npinkie finger, ring \nfinger, \nEFTA00008238\n\n Chapter 11: \nPutting the Moves Together \n197 \nmiddle, then \nindex, over and over, as shown \nin Figure 11-11c. Done \ncor-\nrectly, this \nmove feels \nexquisite, but \nyou \nhave to build up \nconsiderable \nfinger \ndexterity to achieve that. \n4. As if you were \nsqueezing a \ncoin, rub \neach toe \nbetween \nyour index \nfinger \nand thumb, as \nshown in Figure 11-11d. Start with the \nlittle toe and \nprogress toward the big toe, making sure to \nrub on the sides of the toes \nas well as the tops and \nbottoms. \n5. Then, find the exact \nlocation of your partner's shin bone, \nalso called the \ntibia, and then apply firm pressure \nwith both of your thumbs \ntogether \nalong the \noutside (lateral) edge of this bone as \nyou glide your way \nslowly up toward the \nknee, as shown in Figure 11-11e. \n6. You have to use mostly the tips of \nyour thumbs and fingertips to knead \neffectively on the \nfront of the lower leg because, as you \nmay notice, the \nfront of the lower leg is mostly \nbone. Contain your kneading/squeezing \nmovements to \nthe fleshy areas on either side of this \nbone as you \nmove up and down from near \nthe ankle up to the knee, as shown \nin \nFigure \n11-11f. \nVisualize whirled .peas \n. \n• \n.A?menYPoirittddriflfi \ntfielnaesageiyoii can oiler \n.\n:'world \npeace;lOokhisel..WAeldohitiiit?

Use moderate pressure inward \nagainst the knee while making this move, and monitor your partner's \nresponse closely; some \npeople are ticklish in this area. \n8. Continuing up over the knees, use your palms to glide with firm pressure \nin an \nupward direction on the front of the thigh, also known as the \nquadriceps muscles. Slide back down the thigh with light pressure and \nrepeat four to five times. \n9. Apply kneading to the front of the thighs. This is where you can use \nsome really big movements, sliding your hands all the way from the \ninside of the thigh to the \noutside in a constant motion. Remember to use \nyour whole body to create the kneading motion, not just your arms and \nhands. And don't be surprised if you work up a sweat during this move. \n10. Imagine a line running along the outside of your partner's thigh from \nknee to hip (right where the stripe is on many warm-up suits). Starting \nat the knee, apply pinpoint pressure \nwith your thumbs to a series of \npoints along this line, as shown in Figure 11-11h. Hold each point for 3—5 \nseconds, then release and \nmove up to the next point. When you reach \nthe hip, slide back down and repeat one more time. \nThis area is often very sensitive on many people, so you have to be care-\nful when pressing here. Start out softly and increase pressure \ngradually. \nYou can tell if you push too hard by noticing that your partner tenses his \nleg. If \nthis happens, lighten your pressure. \n11. This is an advanced move that requires quite a bit of trust on your part-\nner's part. You \nare putting him in a vulnerable position, one leg bent at \nthe knee, with the hip open to the side. By using your palms, press down \nfirmly \njust above \nthe knee, \nthen glide slowly \nup toward the \nhip, as \nshown in Figurell-12a. For even \nmore intensity, use your knuckles \ninstead of your palms. Glide your hands back down to the knee with \nlight pressure then repeat twice \nmore. \nLighten your pressure \nas you approach the upper thigh, which contains \nmany delicate \nnerves and vessels. \n12. Lay your partner's leg flat again, and then glide your hands upwards \nover the thigh. When you \nreach the hip, swivel your outside hand \naround and slip your fingerstoward your partner's lower back, as shown \nin \nFigure \n11.12b. \nGlide up as far as \nyou can \nalongside the \nspine, then \npress your fingers \nup into the muscles there as you \nslowly pull back \ndown toward the hip again, letting some of your partner's \nweight do the \nwork of pressing. When you reach your \npartner's leg again, continue \ngliding down by using both hands on the back of the leg, lifting slightly \nto get your hands underneath. Finish your \nglide down at the foot. \nEFTA00008240\n\n  \nChapter 11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves Together 7 93 \nRime 1141: \nFleet moves \nfor the feet \nand \nlegs. \nEFTA00008241\n\n794 Part \nIII: The \nArt of \nGiving \nMassage  \n13. Cupping the heel in your palm, lift your \npartner's leg just an inch or so, \nreminding him to \"let go\" if he tries to lift the leg for you. Shake \nback and \nforth with a vibrating motion. \n14. Your last move on the leg is a light fingertip \nbrushing down from the \nhips toward the feet to leave your partner feeling \"grounded.\" \nRepeat this entire sequence on the other leg. \nFigure \n11-12 \nFinishing \nup \nthe feet and \nlegs. \nThe grand finale \nAs with so many things in life, like fireworks and circus acts, in massage it's \nthe grand finale that really counts. Sure, you \ncan apply superlative tech-\nniques all throughout the massage; flowing from one bliss-inducing maneuver \nto the next in seamless perfection; but if you \nfinish with a ho-hum squeeze of \nthe toes and then rush off to grab a cold one from the fridge, you're going to \nleave a slightly disgruntled partner behind. It's like watching a good movie \nwith a bad ending: All anyone can talk about Is how bad the ending was, not \nhow good the rest of the movie \nwas. \nThe way you end the massage leaves a lasting impression. To make your \nfinish the best it can be, follow \nthese steps: \n1.  Use \nlong gliding strokes that flow over the entire body, starting at the \nfeet and moving up onto the torso then down the arms, as shown in \nFigure \n11-13. This is the lightest kind of long-soft-light gliding, not meant \nto actually affect the tissues beneath the skin, but rather to send your \npartner a message of connection (see the sidebar, \"Creating wholeness,\" \nearlier in this chapter). \nYou don't have to wait until the end of the massage to use connective \nstrokes. In fact, you can use them throughout the entire massage \nto con-\nnect everything together. Starting an arm? Connect it to the neck you \njust finished a \nmoment earlier. Go ahead, experiment. \nConnect away! The \npoint is to make your partner feel that you're treating \nhis body as a \nwhole, not segmenting it Into chunks. \nEFTA00008242\n\nChapter 11: Putting the Moves \nTogether 7 95 \nFigure 11-13: \nWhole\n-body \nconnective \nstrokes \ncreate a \nsense of \nwholeness \nand continu-\nity for your \npartner \nat \nthe end of a \nmassage. \nFigure 11 -14: \nPlacing your \nhands softly \non two \nareas \nalso \ncreates a \nsensation of \nconnection. \n2. To finish your massage, place one hand \non your partner's forehead and the \nother \ngently upon his belly, letting them rest there in \ncontact, but without \npressure, for 30 to 60 seconds; \nas shown in Figure 11-14. You may \nbegin to \nfeel his \npulse, or some warmth emanating \nfrom his body. This is good. \nJust tune in to whatever it \nIs you're feeling and, for Just these last \nfew \nseconds, make sure your partner knows \nhe's the center of the universe. \nThis \ntype of Intentional hand \nplacement to balance your \npartner's Inner \nenergy Is known \nIn some quarters as polarity. \nThe last moment of the massage is as \nimportant as the first. When you \nfinally \nbreak contact with \nyour partner for the last time, \nmake it a conscious, gentle \nletting go. \nEFTA00008243\n\n1 96 Part III: \nThe Art of Giving Massage \nEFTA00008244\n\nPart \n111 \nMassage \nat \nWork \nThe \n5th \nWave \nB \nRich \nTennant \n\"71-E \nSRCRT \nANSWER \n10 \nYOUR \nREQUEST \nFORA \nRAISE \nIS \n'NO: \n1RE \nLCNG \nANSWER \nIS \n`NO. \nMD \nGET \nOUT \nCF \nMY \nOFFICE:\" \nEFTA00008245\n\nAi\nof too long ago, work used to be a very physical \nactivity for almost everybody on the planet. Sure, \nthere were always a few pharaohs, high priests, and \nladles-in-waiting whose main activity \nwas flicking fingers \nand \nshoutingcommands, but for 99.99 percent of human-\nity throughout our entire history, \"work\" meant physical \nwork, and we \nused our bodies a lot. \nIn this part ... \nAs you may have noticed, this is not the case anymore. In \na sense, we've all become pharaohs, masters of a digital \ndomain in which we \npush around bits of data as if they \nwere slaves. Click a button, and your wish is executed. \nMost of us check our bodies at the door when we walk \ninto \nwork each morning. \nHowever, even though \nmany of us don't use them as much \nanymore, our bodies are still subject to high levels of \nstress and strain. Recently in the U.S. alone, absenteeism \nwent up 25 percent in one year, and stress was \nthe top \nreason sited for missing work. \nLuckily, \nmassage is here for us, ready to breathe some life \nback \ninto our corporate bodies. It is now possible for mas-\nsage to become a part of your life at work, where you may \nneed it the most. I'm talking about corporate massage \nhere, which is the subject of Chapter 12, in which you find \nout how to take advantage of the growing number of \nmas-\nsage pros who specialize in on-the-Job stress reduction. \nOf \ncourse, a massage pro might not always be available, \nand you need to know how to de-stress yourself on the job \ntoo. Chapter 13 is all about self-massage and stretching \nthat you can do right at the desk or workstation. In addi-\ntion to relaxation techniques, \nyou'll discover some basics \nabout how to combat a very serious problem many office \nworkers, and others, face: carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). \nThe work environment also forces many of \nus, especially \nfemales, to wear strange, sadistic contraptions on our \nfeet, what Steve Martin called \"cruel \nshoes.\" We then walk \naround on hard, \nunnatural surfaces all day, until our \nfeet \nend up needing some serious massage attention of \ntheir \nown. Chapter 14 explains reflexology, a type of massage \nthat concentrates on the feet, \nwith the added benefit of \naffecting the entire body \nthrough its actions as well. \nEFTA00008246\n\nChapter 12 \nThe New \nCoffee Break: Corporate \nMassage for a Digital Generation \n00000•000 OOOOOOO 0 00000000000000000000000000000000 \nIn This Chapter \nD \nConsidering corporate massage \nD \nSitting down to a massage chair \nD \nGoing through the chair routine \n000000000 0000000000000 \n000•000000 OOOOOOOOOO 0000000 \nG\nuess which of the following touch-gurus wrote these words: \"Touch is a \nvery \npowerful message.

Ken Blanchard, corporate consultant \nand author of the business best-\nseller, The One Minute Manager. \n• \nStrangely enough, the answer is D, and \nBlanchard is basically talking about a \npat on the back, not a \nmassage. But his statement does point out the great \nneed for people in the work environment to use the right kind of touch with \neach other. \nAppropriate, stress\n-relieving touch in the workplace is so important that an \nentirely new category of massage has been Invented in the past several years \nto specifically address \nthis issue. This category is called corporate massage, \nand it \nhas become quite popular in offices and workplaces around the world. \nWith corporate massage, a professional massage \ntherapist comes to your \noffice with a specially designed chair that you sit on to receive a massage \nwith your clothes still on. \nThis saves time and makes the whole massage pro-\ncedure \neasy, safe, and acceptable. \nEFTA00008247\n\n200\n   Part IV: Massage at Work \nYou've \nprobably heard more than you want to about sexual harassment, \nabuse of power, and ruined careers, but the wrong kind of touch in the work-\nplace can get you in a lot of trouble. \nCorporate massage, however, can help \nfulfill your touch quotient (your natural need for touch) \nwhile in an environ-\nment that otherwise stifles much healthy contact. \nCorporate Massage \nYour first reaction to the thought of massage at work may be less than posi-\ntive for several reasons. As you contemplate the idea, you may come up with \nsome of the following: \n3 \nCan I  really handle the thought of my co-workers lining up to get \nundressed and rubbed with almond oil in the employee lounge? \n3 \nWhat will my (wife/husband/girlfriend/boyfriend, and so on) say? \n3 Won't the boss think that this kind of massage is a waste of time? Or, if \nyou're the boss: Won't my employees take advantage of this and turn the \noffice into a massage parlor? \n3 Will I  be in an awkward position on a table or chair and look stupid while \nreceiving a massage at work? \n3 How much will the massage cost? \n3 \nWill It mess up my hair? \nThese concerns are all rational, \nand this section is meant to set you straight \non what \ncorporate massage really Is so that you'll run straight out to contact \nyour nearest practitioner and at least give it a try. \nWhat does corporate massage look like, anyway? Well, imagine this scenario: \nIt's late on a Friday afternoon. Your whole department has been under \nintense pressure to wrap up that humongous project you've been working on \nfor months. Nerves are frayed. Happy hour is looming. No one can think \nabout \nanything but escape. Then right at four o'clock, in walks a healthy-\nlooking individual toting a strange, padded, chair-like contraption that he \nproceeds to unfold over in one corner. This is the \"corporate massage\" that \nyour boss promised. \nOne brave soul offers to go first, and the rest of you watch while he sits \ndown — fully clothed — on the device, \nwhich seems to support all of his \nweight easily at the \nknees, elbows, chest, and head. As he leans forward and \nrelaxes, you can feel the pressure on your own limbs \nstart to dissipate, too. \nThe massage therapist begins with some strong kneading of the shoulders \nand upper back. \nEFTA00008248\n\nChapter 12: The New Coffee Break: \nCorporate Massage for a Digital \nGeneration \n201 \n\"Ahh, this Is great!\" roars your co-worker through the \ncircular face rest. \nQuietly, but quickly, people start to drift over to that side of the room, and \nsoon a line begins to form. One after another, everyone is treated to ten min-\nutes of much-needed relief, and a funny \nthing starts to happen. Happy hour is \nno longer \ncalling so urgently. As you stand around \nchatting with newly \nrelaxed colleagues, the ideas \nbegin to flow again, and you end up \nstaying till \nafter 7 p.m., coming up with a few great new concepts that will \nmake this pro-\nject even better. \nYes, scenarios like this one can actually \noccur. Massage in the workplace has \nmany such benefits, including the following: \n3 Increases \nemployee morale \n3 \nLowers stress \n3 \nDecreases \noveruse injuries \n3 \nProvides some high-touch to counterbalance high-tech environments \n3 \nOffers \nemployees something new and different \nThe benefits of this type of \nmassage quickly outweigh the \nconcerns I mention \nat the beginning of this section: \n3 \nNobody has to undress, and if they \nreally don't want their hair messed \nup, they just have ask the \nmassage therapist not to massage their head. \n3 The massage \nis usually given in a public space and is \nvery conservative. \n3 \nThe boss realizes that happy employees \nare productive employees. \n3 \nEmployees who receive this \nextra benefit are more likely to feel grateful \nand be more \nresponsible. \nSo \nyou're left with one last issue — who pays for all this? Normally, payment \nis \nhandled in one of three \nways: \n3 \nThe company pays: This scenario, which is the most \ncommon, allows \nemployees to forget about whether or not they can afford the massage, \nand \nit makes the boss \nlook great. \n3 \nEveryone contributes \nto a pool: This scenario is less common, but \nsome companies still choose it. Pulling \nthose few dollars out of your \npocket may hurt at first, but \nwhat you receive is better for you than the \ntypical office-pool birthday cakes. \n3 Everyone pays separately: This scenario is the least \ncommon. Though it \nmay prove quite popular, paying separately often leaves people feeling a \nlittle at \nloose ends. Should they pay? Should they not pay? \nNo matter what the \nscenario, the massage therapists often \nappreciate tips, \nunless everyone is aware that a service charge has been added up \nfront. \nEFTA00008249\n\n202 \nPart IV: Massage at Work \nEither way, the massage more than pays \nfor itself almost immediately. A mas-\nsage pro \nbrought in once a week or once a month can \ntruly upgrade the total \nwork experience of \neveryone Involved. \nIn addition to chair massage, many \ncorporations now offer full body massage \nthrough their wellness programs, employee fitness programs, \nand so on. My \nadvice? Take advantage of this benefit Immediately. \nCall a \nlocal corporate massage provider and ask him to come in for a free \n\"demo-day.\" With the prospect of potentially gaining a new, ongoing client, \nhe'll probably be eager for the opportunity to prove how good he is with no \ninvestment on your part. This approach is also a way to convince your boss \nthat the expense involved is worth the improved morale and \nproductivity. \nThis situation is win-win-win: The massage provider wins new business. Your \nboss wins happier workers. And you win as the hero who introduced this \ngreat new idea \nto your co-workers. \nMassage Chairs \nMassage in the workplace goes by various names, including corporate mas-\nsage, on-site massage, and chair massage. \nBut regardless of what you call it, \nthis type of massage is guaranteed to involve \nthe use of a specially con-\nstructed device known as the massage chair (see Figure 12-1). \nMassage \nchairs were originally developed in the U.S. by a man named \nDavid \nPalmer who wanted an easy way to massage his clients on the job at the Apple \nComputer company. Now, several models are available from a number of sup-\npliers. The basic idea is \nthat people can lean forward into the device, taking a \nload off their \nhips and legs and thereby position themselves perfectly to \nreceive a back, neck, and shoulder massage. Getting Into one of these things \nis more like lying down than sitting in a chair. Try it sometime; you'll be \namazed at how \nsupported and relaxed you feel. \nAlthough they may look slightly intimidating at first, massage chairs are actu-\nally quite easy to get into and out of. Here's how \nthey work: \n1. Place your knees against the pads and lean your chest forward onto \nthe support; then wrap your bands around front and \nplace your arms \non the arm rest. \nThe chair will be adjusted for you so that the face rest is the correct \nheight; simply lean forward into it and feel your weight shift and become \ndistributed evenly throughout your body. \nIf \nyou're wearing a dress, you can still get on. Just swivel your legs in \nmodestly from the side. \n-4 \nEFTA00008250\n\nChapter12: The New Coffee Break: Corporate Massage for a Digital Generation \n203 \nFigure12-1: \nThe \nmes-\nsage \nchair, \na strange-\nlooking but \ncomfortable \npiece of \nequipment \n(This \none \nwas custom \nmade for the \nauthors by \nGolden \nRatio \nWoodworks.) \nTP \n2. Make sure that the face rest is covered with a tissue or towel, for sani-\ntary reasons. \nWipe the surfaces down after each treatment to prevent body oils from \nbuilding up on the material. \n3. Let the chair take your weight and the massage therapist do the rest. \nDon't try to support yourself in any way during the massage. Just relax \nand enjoy! \nMake a little vow to yourself right here — the next time you spy one of these \nstrange contraptions somewhere with a massage therapist standing by ready \nto work, take the plunge and Jump aboard. You can find them in malls, at air-\nports, in special storefronts like The Stress Station, and even on street \ncorners. See what happens! \nOf course, not everyone has access to chair massage. Perhaps you live in a \nsmall town where no one has ever heard of this concept before. Maybe you \nwork at a place where people would look at you like you're insane for sug-\ngesting that you pay somebody for the privilege of sitting in such a strange \ncontraption. \nEFTA00008251\n\n204\n \nPart IV: Massage at \nWork \nTaking the chair on the road \nOffices aren't the only place where massage \nchairs are put to good use. You also see them in \nthe front lines at athletic events and disaster \nsites, among others. \nFor example, after Hurricane Andrew struck in \nsouth Florida, I and a  crew of other \nmassage \ntherapists headed to the epicenter with our \ntrusty massage chairs to provide neck, shoul-\nder, and back relief for weary soldiers andRed \nCross volunteers. \nIf you \ndon't have a specially made massage chair around, you can use a \nnormal chair to receive many of the same benefits. As shown In Figure 12-2, \nsimply turn the chair around and sit In it backwards. Then lean forward onto \na pillow while your partner works on \nyou. The techniques pictured in this \nchapter are done In a \nprofessional massage chair, but you can recreate them \neasily at home by using this setup. \nfigure \n12-2: \nIf you don't \nhave a \ncustom-\nmade, $400 \nmassage \nchair, a \nreg-\nular \nchair \nturned \nbackwards \nworks pretty \nwell, \ntoo. \nEFTA00008252\n\n_ Chapter 12: The New Coffee Break: Corporate Massage for a \nDigital Generation \n205 \nThe Chair \nRoutine \nFollowing is a simplified \nversion of the chair massage routine that people \nlearn in classes and workshops. You can follow it exactly or \nfeel free to con-\ncentrate on the areas \nwhere your partner needs the most work. \nYou don't need any oil or cream to do this type of massage, and your partner \ndefinitely doesn't have to take his or her shirt off. Also, creating an ideal \n\"Inner chamber\" (as described in Chapter 9) for this experience \nisn't so \nimportant either. Think of chair massage as a rough-and-ready kind of experi-\nence that you can enjoy anywhere, \nanytime, no matter how many distractions \nsurround \nyou. \nThe photographs in this chapter show some basic maneuvers. You're tree to \ndevelop your own style based on the moves f  show you in Chapter 10. \nShoulders and upper back \nThe shoulders — \nwhere almost everyone holds a good amount of \ntension \n—\nare best part of the body to begin a chair massage. After your partner is com-\nfortably seated, start with some kneading in that area (see Figure 12-3). \nRgure12-3: \nThe chair \noffers a per-\nfect \nangle \nfrom which \nto \nwork the \nshoulders \nusing hands, \nforearms, \nand elbows. \nEFTA00008253\n\n206 \nPart IV: Massage at Work \n1. Grasp the tops of both shoulders firmly, with your thumbs in back and \nfingers In front, and then begin kneading. \nYour kneading can be relatively firm. For variety, switch both hands to \none shoulder and then the other, \nbut return to both-shoulder kneading \nat the end. \n2. With your palms facing \ndown, press the meaty underside of your \nforearms directly down on top of your partner's shoulders. \nFor a more intense sensation, turn your \nhands palm up and press the \nforearm bones Into the shoulder. \n3. For the ultimate in pressure, bend your arm and use the point of your \nelbow as a finely \nhoned instrument to zero In on tight spots atop the \nshoulders. \nUse the fingers of your other hand to \nguide the elbow precisely into \nplace, and then ease slowly into \npressing because this move is very \nintense. \n4. Stepping back a couple feet, lean into your \npartner's back, supporting \nyourself with your thumbs \nagainst the ridge of muscles on either side \nof the \nspine. \nLean back, slide down, and \npress again, hitting several points down \nalong the spine to mid-back. \n5. With your elbow on the \nmuscles alongside the spine, hit \nroughly the \nsame points that you did with your thumbs. \nBe careful not to press directly against the spine with \nyour elbows as \nthis could be quite painful. \nArms \nWhen a person is seated in a \nmassage chair, her arms are \neasily accessible. \nSupport the entire weight of the arm in your hands \nwhile you're working on it \nso your partner \ndoesn't have to help you. \n1. Squatting or \nbending at your partner's side (see Figure 12-4), use both \nhands to \nencircle the arm, starting at the top near the shoulder, and \nthen squeeze. \nRelease the squeeze, \nmove down a couple inches, and squeeze again, \nrepeating this \nprocess all the way to the wrist. If \nyou want to add some-\nthing to this move, try pressing with \nyour thumbs as you're releasing \npressure with your palms. \n2. \nFollow the hand massage routine from Chapter 11. \nDon't languish there too long In a squatting or \nbending position or you'll \nend up \nwith a sore back yourself. \nEFTA00008254\n\nChapter 12: The New Coffee Break: \nCorporate Massage for a Digital Generation \n207 \n3. Standing up and stepping back a bit, grasp your partner's arm at the \nwrist and elbow then apply a little gentle shaking. \nAfterwards, gently bring the arm back around to the front and lay it \ndown again. \n4. Repeat the process on the other arm. \nFigure \n12-4: \nYou mas-\nsage the \narms from \na \nsquatting \nposition \neither in \nfront of the \nchair or to \nthe side. \nLower back \nThe lower back is the hardest part to get to during a chair massage because \nit's so low. You can kneel if  you want to, or squat, to make these moves more \ncomfortable on yourself. \n1. When you fi nish the arms, brush lightly down the back to the lumbar \narea, get into a squatting or bending position again, and apply some \nfirm pinpoint pressure (as described in Chapter 10) with the thumbs \ninto the muscles on either side of the spine (see Figure 12-5). \nBe careful not to press too firmly in the kidney area. (See Chapter 10 for \nthe \nreasons.) \nEFTA00008255\n\n20s\nPart IV: Massage at Work \nFigure 12-5: \nYou have to \nsquat or \nkneel to \nwork the \nlower back. \n2. Press in firmly with the heel of your hands against the upper portion \nof your \npartner's buttocks, and then make rapid circles with the right \nhand going clockwise and the left \ncounterclockwise (see Figure 12-6). \nFirst made famous in the movie, The Karate Kid, this move incorporates \na little coordination on your part, along with some good old-fashioned \nrubbing. I know, it's complicated, but you can do it! \nNeck \nAs you can see in \nFigure 12-7, the neck Is In the perfect exposed position for \nyou to work on it to \nyour heart's content. \n1. Standing slightly to the side, use the thumb and fingers of one hand to \nknead up and down the \nback of the neck. \nYou can switch back and forth from side to side and hand to hand. \n2. \nStarting at the base of the skull, press in with your thumb on the mus-\ncles to one side of the spine. \n\"Walk\" your thumb down that muscle to the top of the shoulder, press-\ning in at half-inch intervals as you go. Repeat this \nmaneuver two more \ntimes, each time slightly further away from \nthe spine. \nEFTA00008256\n\nChapter 12: The New Coffee Break: Corporate Massage for a Digital Generation 209 \nFigure 12-ec \nPressing \nwith the \nheels of the \npalms, \nmove \nthe left hand \ncounter-\nclockwise \nand the right \nhand clock-\nwise. \nHgure 12-7: \nWith \nthe \nhead tilted \nslightly for-\nward into \nthe face \nrest, mas-\nsaging the \nneck is \neasy. \nEFTA00008257\n\n270\n \nPart IV: \nMassage at Work \n3. With your thumb on one side of the spine and your fingers on the \nother, make small firm circles on the base of the skull where it \nattaches to \nthe neck. \nHead \nYou can modify the \nthree steps in this section in many different ways, \ndepending on your intentions and the situation you find yourself in. If you're \ngiving seated massage to someone who's going out on a date ten minutes \nlater, for example, don't mess her hair up too much because she wants to \nlook neat when she stands up from the chair. \n1. Plant your fingertips firmly on your partner's scalp and make small \ncircles, moving the \ntissue below but not sliding over the hair (see \nFigure 12.8). \nRepeat in several spots. Before you start, ask your partner whether he \nminds having his hair messed up a bit. \n2. Reaching your fingers forward on both sides of the head, find the tem-\nples (which are partially covered by the face rest in a professional \nmassage \nchair) and press in for 5 to 10 seconds. \nThis move is great for people with minor headaches. \n3. Use your fingertips and thumbs to apply mint-kneading all over the \noutside rims of the ears, pulling gently up on the tops and down on \nthe lobes. \nFinish \nChair massage is usually an invigorating experience, and people often have to \nget back to work or \nanother activity soon afterwards.

Utilizing self-massage \np \nFollowing a self-massage mini-routine \nI> Recognizing carpal tunnel syndrome \ny\nou're not always going to be able to convince somebody else to give you \na massage. Like it or not, at times you'll be sore, achy, tired, emotionally \nneedy, and Just plain crying out for a massage, but the people around you \nwill be much more Interested In the football game on TV, or in going to lunch. \nDon't \ndespair. There are some simple massage techniques that you can use \non yourself, without the need for anyone else's participation — or sympathy. \nAnd, coincidentally, those very techniques appear in this chapter! \nThese moves work equally as well at home, of course, but I'm including them \nhere in the massage-at-work section because that's where so many people \nend up all stressed-out, with no outlets to relax. Sure, you can \nstand up in \nyour cubicle and sing the Frank Sinatra tune, I   did it my way,\" \nto take a slight \nedge off the tension, but wouldn't quietly engaging in a few self-massage tech-\nniques be easier — and a little \nmore discreet? \nSome of these moves not only feel good, but can actually make quite a differ-\nence in your productivity level, which should make your boss happy, too. \nThe techniques to fight carpal \ntunnel syndrome, for instance, can help keep \nyou tapping \naway at the computer for years, and spare your company some \nexpensive worker's comp bills at the same time. \nSo, \nlimber up those fingers (use the massage-muscle building tips from \nChapter 10 if you'd like) and get ready for a treatment from one of the \nmost \ntalented, and reliable, massage masters around — you. \nEFTA00008261\n\n274\n \nPart IV: Massage at \nWork \nSett\n-Massage: The Basics \nSay you're sitting at your desk. Your neck is killing you, but \nyou don't want to \nask a co-worker to massage it because the other people In your office may get \nnervous, jealous, or both. What're you gonna do? Well, you can grab that \nnifty massage gizmo that you have stashed \nin \nyour \nbottom drawer, but it \nmakes a loud, buzzing noise. Instead, sitting right \nthere in your chair, you can \ngive yourself an entire mini-massage, get some good relief, and be relatively \ndiscreet. \nSelf-massage is as easy as following a few simple guidelines. Don't stress the \nrest of your body out while trying to relax one spot. Use correct body \nmechanics (see Chapter 10) while applying self-massage moves, Just as you \ndo for partner massage. Here are the basic rules for self-massage: \n3 Keep breathing: This rule holds true whether you're massaging a part-\nner \nor yourself. \n3 Focus on the sore spots that you find and be willing to experience a \nlittle \"pleasurable pain\": At the same time, don't overdo it — self-\ninflicted, black-and-blue marks are hard to explain. \n3 Be intuitive: Nobody knows better than you where that tight spot is. \nUsing the routine in this chapter as a mere template; follow your own \nInner guidance. \nSett-Massage \nMini-Routine \nKeeping the points from the.preceding section In mind, you can move \nstraight into a ten-minute mini-routine right at your desk. If you're at home, \nyou can do this on a sofa or a stool just as easily as you can on your chair at \nwork. In fact, you can do this routine anywhere you can sit down, although \nyou may look a little funny massaging your own feet on a city bus. \nIrrigate your head \nOne of the biggest causes for all of your problems, whether you know it or \nnot, is a non-irrigated head. Think about it. All day long you're walking or \nstanding or sitting, and your head is the highest point on your body. Your \nheart has to pump the blood against gravity to supply your brain, which can \nleave you feeling foggy-headed at times. Have you ever experienced that in \nthe middle of a long day at work? Why not help your brain stay sharp by irri-\ngating it with extra oxygen-rich blood? \nEFTA00008262\n\nChapter 13: Cubicle Maneuvers: Self-Massage for the \nKeyboard Jockey \n215 \nA \ngreat way to start the self-massage \nroutine is to simply lean forward in \nyour \nchair, getting your \nhead somewhere in the vicinity of your \nknees. Keep your \nfeet flat on the ground and \nclasp your hands behind your \nback, as shown in \nFigure 13-1. If you feel limber enough, \nraise your hands up toward the ceiling \nfor a nice stretch. \nFigure 13-1: \nTo start the \nself-\nmassage, \nlean forward \nin your \nchair \nand bring \nsome fresh \nblood to \nyour \nbrain. \nStretch your arms \nand upper \nback \nSitting upright once \nagain, continue your warm-up by \nreaching across your \nbody with \none arm and grasping it at the elbow \nwith the opposite hand. Pull \nthe \nelbow in against your chest (see \nFigure 13-2), which should \ncreate a \nstretching \nsensation across your shoulder. If you don't feel \na stretching sen-\nsation, either you're super-limber, or \nyou're not pulling on the elbow firmly \nenough. \nRepeat with \nthe other arm. \nReach around to \nthe back of your neck this time, \ngrasp your elbow once \nagain and pull to the opposite side \n(as shown in Figure 13-3), \nwhich stretches \nyour upper \narm and further opens your shoulder joint. \nFor an extra stretch, \nbend \ntoward the side you're \npulling with at the same time. \nRepeat \nwith the other arm. \nEFTA00008263\n\n216 \nPart IV: \nMassage at Work \nFigure 13-1 \nSitting up \nstraight \nagain, reach \nacross your \nbody to \nstretch the \nshoulder \nand upper \nback \nFigure 13-3: \nWith one \nhand behind \nyour head, \nraise the \nelbow, \ngrasp it \nwith \nthe \nopposite \nhand, and \npull for \nanother \nstretch. \nMassage \nyour temples, \nface, and jaw \nTime to start the \nactual massage \nmoves. Reach up and apply \ncircular \nrubbing — see Chapter 10— \nto your temples, as \nFigure 13-4a shows. \nThis \nmove is a good \nway to combat tension \nheadaches. Make \nyour circles slow, \ndeliberate, and firm, staying \nin contact with one \narea on the skin \nwhile you \nmove \nover the bones below. \nSliding your \nfingers up on to your \nforehead, continue the \ncircular rubbing \nuntil your fingers \nmeet in the middle \nabove the nose (see \nFigure 13-4b). Then \npush \nin with the fingertips and \nglide back toward the \ntemples again, keeping \nfirm pressure against the \nskin the whole time. \nRepeat two more times. \nEFTA00008264\n\nChapter 13: Cubicle Maneuvers: Self\n-Massage for the Keyboard Jockey \n217 \nYou may be surprised at how much tension gets lodged in your jaw muscles. \nTension hides out there like an enemy soldier wearing camouflage gear, espe-\ncially while you're sitting at your desk, straining forward to concentrate on \nthe computer screen. With the proper pressure and sensitivity, you can flush \nthis tension \nout. \nUsing your fingertips, press in at the angle of your jaw, and \nwhile you're \npressing, open and close your mouth slightly, which allows you to find the \nexact point that feels like it's holding the most tension. \nApply slow deep cir-\ncular rubbing to that spot, plus a little pinpoint pressure (both moves are \ndescribed in Chapter \n10), until you feel your Jaw start to relax and drop (see \nFigure 13-4c). \nUse enough pressure with these moves to sink your fingers into the \njaw mus-\ncles slightly but not so \nmuch that you feel pain. Be careful; the \njaw's a \nsensitive area. \nUsing your thumbs, \"hook\" them in to press up against the bone just beneath \nyour \neyebrow, right next to your nose, as shown in Figure 13-4d. \nThis is \nanother good headache point. Hold the pressure \nfor about 5 seconds. \nRpm \n13-4: \nMassaging \nall around \nthe face. \nEFTA00008265\n\n275\n \nPart IV: \nMassage at Work \nRub \nthat neck \nReach \naround to the back \nof your neck with \nboth hands and hook \nyour \nthumbs up under \nthe base of the \nskull (see Figure \n13-5a). Press In firmly \nand \nhold for .5 to 10 \nseconds. This move alone \nshould leave you feeling \nmore alert \nand relaxed. \nNow drop your head \nforward and pick a hand, any \nhand (probably your \ndominant one), \nto perform kneading on \nthe back of your neck as you \nsee in \nFigure \n13-5b. Squeeze from \nthe base of your neck \nup to your head and \nthen \nback \ndown again. Repeat twice. \nTurn your head to the left \nand reach across with \nyour left hand to knead atop \nyour right \nshoulder and up onto your \nneck, using your thumb \nto press into \nany knots you find along \nthe way (see Figure \n13-5c). This move also provides \na good \nstretch for your neck. Repeat \non the opposite side. \nSqueeze \nyour arms \nand hands \nStarting at your \nshoulder, begin squeezing \ndown your arm, as shown in \nFigure 13-6. When you reach a \ntender spot, hook your \nthumb in and hold for a \nmoment. Stop \nwhen you reach your \nwrist, glide lightly back \nup to your shoul-\nder, and repeat one \nmore time. \nRepeat on \nthe opposite arm. \nPinch the \nwebbing between your \nthumb and forefinger of your \nopposite hand \n(see Figure \n13-7). Hold for 5 to 7 seconds. \nThis spot may be quite \nsensitive. \nYou can also do some coin \nrubbing on the fingers, \ncircular rubbing on the \nwrists, and \nany of the other moves \nfeatured in the hand massage \nsection of \nChapter 11— \nmodified, of course, to be performed \nby one hand on yourself. \nEFTA00008266\n\nChapter 13: Cubicle Maneuvers: Self-Massage for the Keyboard Jockey \n219 \nFigure 13-5: \nGetting rid \nof that \npain \nin \nyour \nneck. \nMassage your tower \nback \nScoot forward to the front of your \nchair and reach around to your lower back. \nUsing your thumbs, press into several points along the-muscles \nbeside your \nspine (see Figure \n13.8). \nThen lift and press onto the base of your spine (the \nsacrum) itself, hitting several more points.

(See \nFigure 13-9). \nEFTA00008268\n\nChapter 13: Cubicle Maneuvers: Self\n-Massage for the Keyboard Jockey \n22 \nFigure \n134 \nReach \naround to \nyour lower \nback and \nuse your \nthumbs \nand/or \nknuckles to \npress in. \nFigure \n134 \nBend one \nleg and \nplace your \nfoot on your \nopposite \nknee \nto \nmassage \ndown \nyour leg. \nIf you're in an area where \nyou can take your shoes off, by all means do so and \napply as many of the foot massage moves from Chapter 14 as you can. \nWhen you finish the self-massage mini-routine, take a couple of deep, \nrelaxing \nbreaths (see the \"Breathing lesson\" sidebar in Chapter 7) before you dive \nInto whatever activity you have lined up \nnext. \nEFTA00008269\n\n222\n \nPart IV: \nMassage at Work \nWhy \nmassaging \nyourself \nfeels different \nYou may notice \nthat even when you \napply self-\nmassage techniques \nwith an incredible amount \nof verve and enthusiasm, they \nstill don't feel \nquite as good as \nwhen somebody \nelse applies \nthe very same \nmoves on the very same parts of \nyour body. But why? \nThe \nreason is simple. Massage, like \ntickling (you \ncan't do that very \nwell to yourself either), is \npri-\nmarily a \nsocial interaction. \nStudies (yes, actual \ntickle studies \nby serious researchers) \nhave \nshown that preschool \nchildren couldn't be \ntickled \nwhen they were in a \nbad mood or by \nsomeone whom \nthey didn't like. They were \npoked in the ribs and brushed on \ntheir feet, but \nthe reaction \nwas completely \nnegative. It seems \nthat tickling is as much \nabout relationship and \ncontext \nas it is about contact. And so it \nis with \nmassage. A large \npart of the enjoyment \nof a \nmassage \nis the social \ninteraction with \nanother \nperson, \nwhich actually causes the sensations \nto \nfeel different \nCarpal \nTunnel \nSyndrome \n(CTS) \nYou've \nprobably heard the phrase \ncarpal tunnel syndrome \n(CTS for short), \nand you know it has \nsomething to do \nwith pain in the hand \nand wrist area, \nright? \nThat's the \n\"syndrome\" part of the \nphrase. But what is the \ncarpal tunnel \nanyway? An \nunderground passage \nfor carp? A tube running \nthrough your \nhand \nsomewhere? No, the carpal tunnel \nis actually an area in \nyour wrist, sur-\nrounded on \nthree sides by the \nlittle bones of the hands \n(carpal bones) and \non \none side by the \ntransverse carpal \nligament, as shown in \nFigure 13-10. Several \ntendons pass through \nthis \"tunnel,\" along with \nthe median nerve, a \nvery \nImportant \nnerve that supplies \nsensation and action to \nmost of your hand. \nInflammation or swelling \nof the tendons and tissues \nthat surround the \nmedian nerve \ncan compress it within \nthe carpal tunnel's \nconstricted space. \nThis decidedly un-fun \nexperience can cause \npain, numbness, \ntingling, burn-\ning, and \nloss of hand strength, \namongst other problems. \nRepeating the same \nwrist-Intensive \nactivity, such as typing on a \ncomputer keyboard, over \nand \nover and \nover again, triggers this \ninflammation. \nCompression of the median \nnerve was recognized as a \nproblem as far back as \n1854; in 1947, Dr. \nGeorge Phalen made \nhis first diagnosis of \n\"carpal tunnel \nsyndrome.\" Today, this \ncondition debilitates \npeople at an alarming \nrate. It \nnow affects \napproximately ten \npercent of all workers who \nengage in repetitive \nactivities with their hands. \nEFTA00008270\n\nChapter13: Cubicle Maneuvers: \nSelf-Massage for the Keyboard Jockey \n223 \nFigure 13-10: \nYour \ncarpal \ntunnel looks \nlike \nthis. \nDo you \nhave CTS? \nIf you've been experiencing \nsome funky sensations in your own hands and \narms lately, don't panic. You may Just have some normal aches and pains \ncaused by overwork. A nice vacation \nand some well deserved wrist-rest will \nput you right back in shape. However, CTS is not something to take lightly. \nMany people \nend up having to undergo surgery, endure considerable pain, \nand lose valuable time at work because of this condition. \nAs with any health problem, early detection is the key to effective treatment. \nIf you notice \nany of the symptoms in the following bulleted list, immediately \nseek medical advice, in addition to trying \nthe exercises and massage tech-\nniques in this section: \n3 You wake up in the \nmiddle of the night or first thing in the morning with \nnumbness, tingling, and an achy feeling In your hands. \n3 \nYour little finger seems to be \nunaffected while the rest of your fingers \nexperience pain and \nnumbness. \nEFTA00008271\n\n224 \nPart IV: Massage \nat Work \n3 You \nbegin losing strength in \nyour hands: Your grip \nbecomes weak; you \nbegin dropping \nthings. \n3 You experience \npains shooting down your \nforearms. \n3 Your hands and wrists \nbecome swollen. \nFigure 13-11: \nPhalen's test \nfor CTS. The \nbacks of \nyour hands \nare \ntogether, \nbut without \npressure, \nfor \n60 seconds. \nOne \nway to test yourself \nfor CTS is to take \nPhalen's test, which is \nquite easy to \ndo. \nCompletely flex your wrists \nand hold the backs of \nyour hands together —\nwithout force — \nfor 6O seconds (see \nFigure 13-11). Any \nnumbness, tingling, or \npain, \nindicates a positive \ntest, and you should \nseek a physician's \nopinion. \nWhat you can \ndo about CTS \nAt first, \nyou don't have to do \nmuch to combat \nCTS. Simply shaking \nout your \nhands \nvigorously relieves the Initial \nnumbness or tingling. \nBut the pain can \nprogress to a point that \nmakes your work \nunpleasant or even impossible. \n(CTS is not \nuncommon, by the \nway, in massage pros \nwho're using their \nhands \nall day In \nquite intensive ways.) \nThe best \nstrategy at this early stage \nis, of course, to stop \ndoing what's caus-\ning the pain. \nHowever, because your pain\n-causing activity is often your \nmoney-making activity as well, \nthe pain is often overruled. If \nyou must con-\ntinue the activity, \nyou can do several things to \ntry and improve the \nsituation. \nJust one \nor a combination of the \nsuggestions listed here \nmay help you: \n3 Take breaks: Even \nshort breaks during the \nwork day help relieve the \nrepetitive \nstresses you're putting \non your hands. \n3 Get \nergonomic: Make sure that \nyour wrists are as straight \nas possible \nwhile working and \nthat your back is upright. \nUse wrist rests for your \nkey-\nboard and \nmouse. Don't press \nweight onto your wrists \nwhile working. \nEFTA00008272\n\nChapter 13: Cubicle \nManeuvers: \nSelf\n-Massage \nfor the Keyboard \nJockey \n225 \n3 \nImmobilize it: Use inexpensive splints and braces (available in \ndrug and \nmedical supply stores) to immobilize \nyour wrist while working and even \nwhile sleeping. \n3 Ice your wrist: An ice pack on your wrist helps \nreduce the inflammation \nof tendons \nand tissues in your carpal tunnel. \n3 Apply \nheat: \nHeat \nhelps \nsoothe \ntightened \nmuscles in your upper arms, \nshoulders, and \nneck that often accompany CTS. \n3 Seek treatment \n•  Chiropractic: Spinal adjustments may help relieve pressure on.the \nnerves of your arm and hand, \nreducing pain. \n•  Acupuncture: This therapy balances the \nentire \nsystem and \nmay \nhelp heal the injured nerve. \n•  Ultrasound: High-frequency sound waves may help relieve pain \nand inflammation. \n•  Physical therapy: Physical therapy \nincludes many types of therapy \nthat can \nhelp rehabilitate the wrist area after treatment. \n• Massage therapy: Certain massage therapists are experts in CTS \nrelief. \n•  Homeopathy: Some good anti-inflammatory ointments and creams \nare available that can be used alone or in conjunction with any of \nthe other treatments. Homeopathy utilizes minute \namounts of a \nremedy that would cause symptoms On this case \ninflammation) in \na \nhealthy person. \n• \nSurgery: Surgery involves cutting (and sometimes severing) the \ntransverse carpal ligament that surrounds your wrist, which is a \npretty dramatic step to take. \nPressure is taken off the median \nnerve, and eventually scar tissue grows in to fill the gap. \nSometimes, in later stages, it's the only thing that will help. But \nthen you run the risk of re-experiencing the pain as the scar heals \nand the tissues tighten around the carpal \ntunnel once again. \n3 Use the exercises and self-massage \ntechniques in this section. \nExercise and \nsettmassage for aS \nThe following are simple techniques that are meant to \nhelp, not cure, CTS. \nRemember, always seek the advice of a physician when treating any serious \nhealth problem. \nIf you want some up-to-date Information on CTS, visit www. sechrest . corn/ \nmmg/ct \nsktsintro . html , where you can even view an animation of what \nCTS surgeries look like. \nEFTA00008273\n\n226\n \nPart IV: Massage at Work \nChinese \nexercise \nballs \nSteve Chagnon, a \nmassage therapist who \nstudied in China and the \nU.S., has \ndeveloped a treatment \nprogram for CTS sufferers, \nand he offers a simple \napproach for \npeople who want something \nthey can do for \nthemselves. \nAccording \nto him, Chinese exercise \nballs are an effective, \nconsistent way to \ntreat this situation. \nChinese \nexercise balls are inexpensive \nand widely available in \ndepartment \nstores, specialty shops, and \nChinese grocery stores. \nThey're a little smaller \nthan a golf \nball, and they come in pairs. \nTo use them, you put them \nboth in \none palm and rotate \nthem around each other, \nusing only the one hand to \ncreate the \nmovement (see \nFigure 13-12). \nFigure 13-1t \nUsing the \nChinese \nexercise \nballs is a \nquick and \neasy way to \nrelieve some \nCTS \npain. \nMost squeeze-gizmos get all your \nmuscles flexing and extending \nat the same \ntime, but with \nthe exercise balls you're only \nflexing one muscle at a time, in \nrotation, which helps to \npump your lymph fluids. \nTraditionally, the exercise \nballs are said to \nstimulate reflex points in the \npalm, but this lymph\n-pumping \naction is a \nmore important factor in \naddressing CTS, according to \nChagnon, \nwho believes that a \nbuild-up of lymph fluids in the \nwrist area is a major con-\ntributing factor to the condition \n(see the explanation of the \nlymph system in \nChapter 1). \nJust using \nthe exercise balls five minutes \na day will help. You may want \nto \nkeep them nearby and pick \nthem up during computer \ndownloads or while \nbooting up. \nWarming up your arm and hand \nmuscles in this way at the \nbegin-\nning of a work session is \nespecially important. \nEFTA00008274\n\nChapter \n13: \nCubicle \nManeuvers: \nSelf\n-Massage \nfor \nthe \nKeyboard \nJockey \n227 \nSelf\n-massage \nfor \nlymphatic \ndrainage \n*aro \n\"Once

The art of \ndeveloping fast reflexes for use in such real-world situations \nas \ngunfights and race \ncar driving. \nC. The act \nof flexing \nsomething \nover again after you've flexed it once \nalready. \nD. \nNone of the \nabove. \nThe answer, as you may have suspected, is A, but just knowing that \ndoesn't \ndo you much good, \ndoes it? Not unless you know a little of the background of \nreflexology and the philosophy behind this unique therapy, as well. \nZone Therapy \nThe origins of \nmodern reflexology are rooted in another treatment method \ncalled zone therapy. In 1917, Dr. William H. Fitzgerald of Boston City \nHospital \npublished a book called Zone Therapy, or \nRelieving Pain at Home. In it, he \nstated that many types of health problems could be helped, or even cured, by \napplying pressure to various strategic points, mostly \non the hands. \nThis whole idea did not catch on like wildfire, but one of Dr. Fitzgerald's asso-\nciates, a therapist in his office named \nEunice Ingharti, took the idea and \ntweaked it a bit, \nexperimenting with many people, mostly on their feet, which \nshe thought were more sensitive than the hands. Eventually, she wrote her \nown books, Stories \nthe Feet Can Tell, and that follow-up favorite, Stories the \nFeet Have Told. Ingham's work and her books heralded the birth of \nmodern \nreflexology. \nThe work of Eunice Ingham is continued today at \nthe International Institute of \nReflexology, founded in 1973. You can call or write the Institute to request \nbooks, charts, tools, and more. \nBut just what is zone \ntherapy anyway? According to zone theory, your body \ncan be divided (metaphorically, of course) \ninto long slender pieces. \nEverything that's going on in any one part of a particular zone can be felt in a \ndistant part of that same zone. You can see, \nthen, how something happening \nin your abdomen can be reflected, or felt, in your foot. By stimulating a cer-\ntain point in the foot, you can.treat \nthe pancreas, for example. \nAll of this talk about reflexes and zones may leave you feeling a little \n\"zoned \nout\" yourself, but don't let that worry \nyou. The whole concept is pretty ' \nsimple if you Just remember that the bottoms of the two feet put together can \nbe looked at like a miniature map of the \nentire body. So the head is up by the \nbig toe, the spine goes down the middle, and so on. Figure 14-1 shows a \nreflexology chart. \nEFTA00008279\n\n232\n   Part IV: Massage at \nWork \nFigure \n14-1: \nA reflexol-\nogy chart. \nEyes \nEars \nLung \nSolar \nplexus \nDiaphragm \nGallbladder \nTransverse \ncolon \nAscending \ncolon • \nIleocecal \nvalve \nBrain \nHead & sinuses \nPituitary \ngland \nThyroid, \nneck, \nparathyroid \nThymus \nHeart \nThyroid area \nLiver \nAdrenal glands \nStomach \nPancreas \nDuodenum \nSpinal area \nSmall intestine \nBladder \nTailbone \nSciatic \nnerve \nArm \nShoulder \nSpleen \nKidney \nDescending \ncolon \nSigmoid colon \nSome people \nswear by \nreflexology as a life-saving \nhealing method. \nIn fact, the \nwoman I learned the \ntechnique from \nwas diagnosed with \na serious form of \ncancer \nand not given much \nchance of survival. \nNone of the \nconventional \ntreatments seemed \nto be helping, so as a \nlast resort she \nturned to a Greek \nman in his \nnineties who \nspecialized in \nreflexology. He also \nrecommended \ncoffee enemas. \nWithin several \nmonths, this woman was \ncured and has been \nliving \na normal, \nproductive life for over 20 \nyears. (After the \nexperience, how-\never, she did \ndevelop a slight \naversion to coffee \nshops.) \nFrankly, nobody can tell you \nwhy reflexology works. \nBut the truth is it often \ndoes. \nReflexology is still a \ntheory, but one \nwith practical \napplications, and it \ncertainly \nwon't hurt you to give \nit a try. It may \nindeed help your \noverall \nhealth, but at the \nvery least reflexology \nis guaranteed to \nfeel darn good on \nyour \nfeet. \nFoot \nMassage \nRoutine \nThis \nsection gives you a 20\n-minute foot \nmassage routine based on \nthe princi-\nples \nof reflexology. \nThe routine Is so \neasy to do that \nalmost anyone can \nfollow \nEFTA00008280\n\n Chapter14: Relief for \nthe Feet with Reflexology \n233 \nthe instructions and perform the entire routine from start to finish the very \nfirst time, \neven \nmembers of the United \nStates \nlegislature. So, of \ncourse, that \nmeans you should have no problem at all. \nPositioning \nFirst, get yourself and your partner in a comfortable position. The partner-\nreclining position shown in Figure 14-2 is the one favored by professional foot \nmassagers around \nthe world, \nbut you can also \nposition your \npartner on \na bed \nor massage table so that her feet are just at the edge. She can even lie on the \nfloor. Also, pay attention to the way you're bending over to access your part-\nner's soles and toes. You don't want to hurt yourself while trying to help \nsomeone else. \nYou can perform this routine through stockings or socks if you don't want to \nremove them. So far, though, no method has been devised to perform reflex-\nology through a pair \nof shoes. \nPoints to remember \nIf you want to remain friends with the person you're giving the foot massage \no, keep in mind a few things when \nyou're about to dig into her soles: \n3 Start on the left foot. This compliments your partner's natural digestion \nand \ncirculatory patterns. \n3 \nDon't use oil, because it makes the foot too slippery. Corn starch works \nwell to absorb \nexcess \nmoisture, so rub \nsome on your \npartner's feet \nbefore you \nbegin. \n3 \nAlways talk to your partner and ask for \nfeedback. \n3 Don't diagnose any problems or treat someone for serious•disorders \n(leave that to \nphysicians). \n3 \nDon't use any instruments or tools to push against the feet (such as \npencil erasers for example, which have been known to get lodged \nbetween toes). Use only \nyour fingers and thumbs. \n3 \nNever push so hard that you cause pain or discomfort. If your partner is \nin pain, ease up your pressure a little \nbit. \n3 Finish one foot \ncompletely, and then go on to the next. \nEFTA00008281\n\n234\n    Part IV: Massage at Work \nFigure 142• \nKick your \nfeet \nup. Rest \na \nspell. This \nis an optimal \nposition \nfor \nreflexology. \nBasic \nmoves \nYou can make certain basic, time-tested moves on the feet. These moves have \nbeen passed down by practicing \nreflexologists from generation to generation, \nand now you \ncan use them, too. This section \nprovides you with detailed \nexplanations of these moves \nand how to use them yourself. \nCradling \nCradle your partner's foot (at either the ball \nof the foot or the ankle) in both \npalms, with \nyour fingers pointing straight ahead. \nThen move your hands back \nand forth rapidly, just an inch or so (as shown in Figure 14-3). This move Is \nespecially good for warming up, and you can also use \nit in the middle of a \nfoot massage to give your \npartner a little extra pleasure. Cradling feels so \ngood \nit was called \"dessert\" by one of my \ncolleagues who specialized In \nreflexology at a spa where I worked. \nThumb \nWalking \nThe most basic move \nof all in foot reflexology is \"thumb \nwalking,\" which Is a \nlot trickier than it looks. Start by \nplacing the pad of your thumb firmly against \nyour partner's foot (as shown in Figure 14-4a). Then bend the thumb and \ncreep it forward like an inchworm across the \nsurface, pressing in while you do \nso \n(as shown in Figure 14-4b). Every time you bend your thumb, \nmove your \nhand forward just slightly. You may want to practice this technique a little \nbefore subjecting your partner to a spastic or weak inchworm \nmovement. \nEFTA00008282\n\nChapter14: Relief for the Feet with Reflexology \n235 \nFigure 14-3: \nThis \nmove is \ncalled \n\"cradling,\" \nand it feels \nmost \ndelicious. \nFigure 14-4: \nStart with \nyour thumb \nin the posi-\ntion on the \nleft (a); then \ninch \nyour \nthumb for-\nward while \nbending it \nto wind up \nin \nthe posi-\ntion on the \nright (b). \nIndex anger \ntechnique \nSometimes (for \nexample, when you're working on the \nsides and tops of your \npartner's feet), using your thumbs is just plain awkward. That's when you can \nuse the length of your index finger to slide next to the ankles and between the \nlong bones that run from the heels to the \ntoes, for Sample, as shown in \nFigure 14-5a. \nEFTA00008283\n\n236\n \nPart IV: Massage at \nWork \nFigure 14-& \nUsing your \nindex \nfi\nnger (a), \nhooking \nin (b), \nwringing \n(c), \nand doing \ncircles \n(d). \nHooking in \nUsing the tips of the thumbs or index fingers, bend slightly at the last knuckle \nand \"hook in\" at the point \nyou're targeting (see Figure 14-513). This technique \nallows for some \npinpoint pressure on the bony, intricate surfaces of the foot. \nWringing the foot \nBecause the arch of the foot corresponds to the spine in \nreflexology, this \ntechnique is like giving a chiropractic adjustment to the foot. Grasping your \npartner's toes with one hand and her heel with the other, give a gentle twist \nin opposite directions as if wringing out the arch of the foot (as shown in \nFigure \n14-5c). \nAnkle circles \nHolding your partner's ankle In one hand, circle her foot around In both \ndirections (clockwise and counterclockwise) for several seconds, stretching \nthe muscles and tendons in the area, and warming up the ligaments (see \nFigure \n14-5d). \nStep-by-step \nBegin by getting into the most comfortable position, as mentioned earlier, \nand then do this warm-up: \nEFTA00008284\n\nChapter 14: \nRelief for the \nFeet with \nReflexology \n237 \nV \nCradle the \nball of the foot. \nV \nCradle the \nankle. \nfro Do ankle \ncircles. \nsof Stretch the toes back and forth. \nV \nSqueeze the foot. \nNow you're ready to move into the 15-step foot massage routine that follows, \nwhich is based on the work of Claire Marie Miller in North Carolina. \nRemember to start on the left foot, complete the entire routine, and then \nrepeat the process on the right foot. Refer to Figure 14-1 if you need help. \nI. Head: Your head is filled with lots of important anatomical highlights, \nsuch as the brain. It's worth spending a few extra \nminutes here as you \nbegin your \nreflexology routine. \nTo \naffect the \nreflexes of the head, do \nsome small, \nfocused, thumb walk-\ning in three lines \ndown the big toe and three lines across the bottom of \nthe big toe. \n2. Neck: The neck can be an area of nagging pain. Sometimes working \nthe reflex areas for the neck can help bring relief. \nDo thumb walking back and forth along the base of the big toe, right \nwhere it attaches to the foot. To specifically treat the region at the base \nof the back of your skull, \"hook in\" with your \nthumb on the lower, inside \npart of your big toe, between it and the second toe. This is often a key \npoint \nfor relieving headaches and neck tension. \n3. Face: Yes, even the face has a reflex on the \nfoot, which is perhaps why \nit seems so easy to put your foot in your mouth. \nDo thumb walking across the top of the big toe, then \n\"hook in\" right at \nthe base of the toenail. \n4. Sinuses: The sinus cavities are hollow areas in your head, behind your \nface. Keeping them clear and healthy helps you breathe more easily. \nThe points for the sinuses can be found on the bottoms of all of the little \ntoes. To stimulate them, do three lines of thumb walking down the \nbottom of each toe, and \"hook in\" right in the center of each toe for a \ncouple seconds. \n5. Ears/eyes: The ears and eyes have reflexes by the base of the middle \ntoes. Stimulating those reflexes may help you keep your senses of \nsight and hearing keen and alert. \nEFTA00008285\n\n23s\nPart \nIV: Massage at Work \nUsing your \nknuckles or both thumbs, press in on the spots on the \nbottom of the foot between the second and third toes (for the eyes) and \nbetween the third \nand fourth toes (for the ear reflexes). You can press \nboth areas at the same \ntime. The spots are on the very edge of the \nbottom of the feet, almost on the webbing between the toes themselves. \n6. Lungs/chest: The area around the balls of your foot reflects your air \npassages, bronchial tubes, \nlungs, and chest muscles. If you stop \nbreathing, you may run into some \nserious problems, and so you will \nbenefit by paying attention to the healthy functioning of your lungs. \nUse the index \nfinger technique for this reflex, sliding the length of your \nfinger between the long metatarsal bones on top of the foot and pressing \nin against them. You can \nalso switch your hand around and slide your \nfinger between the same bones from the bottom. \n7. Diaphragm: The \ndiaphragm (discussed in more detail in Chapter 7) is \nthe muscle at the bottom of your lungs that is responsible for keeping \nyou breathing. So, if you like breathing, try \nto keep this muscle happy. \nPushing the toes up toward your partner's head with one hand, use the \nthumb of the \nother hand to walk back and forth along an imaginary line at \nthe base of the ball of the \nfoot, approximately two inches from the toes. \n8. Spine: Many people experience \nback pain, and many of those same \npeople seem to have pain in the arches of their feet as well. A coinci-\ndence? Not when you know \nthat the arches of the feet correspond in \nreflexology with the spine. \nDo thumb walking up and down the reflex for the spine, which is \nbasi-\ncally the arch of the foot. You may want to switch thumbs when you're \nmoving up the arch and back down, which will make this technique less \nawkward. \nThen \"wring\" the spine out by twisting the arch of \nthe foot. Hold the heel \nwith one hand and the toes with the other, while twisting gently \nin oppo-\nsite directions. \n9. Inner organs: The center of the bottoms of the feet correspond to sev-\neral of your internal organs, and this is the area where \nyou can easily \nget confused. You may want to study the chart in Figure 14-1 quite \nclosely as you go about stimulating the reflexes here. The internal \norgans are where you take the outside world in and transform it into \nyour body. \nImportant digestive and filtering processes take place here. \nWhen you're working on \nthe left foot, do \nthumb \nwalking in the center \nbelow the lung and diaphragm reflexes, where you'll find the areas corre-\nsponding to the stomach, the pancreas, the spleen, and the heart. Then \nwalk your thumb from left to right across the center of the foot and \ndown the \noutside, which corresponds with the last half of the large \nintestine. \nEFTA00008286\n\nChapter14: \nRelief for the Feet \nwith Reflexology \n239 \nWhen working on the \nright foot, walk the thumb in the \nsame area, but as \nyou \ndo, you'll be stimulating \nthe liver and gallbladder \ninstead. Then walk \nyour thumb up the \noutside edge of the heel \nand across the center of \nthe \nfoot to \nstimulate the first half of \nthe large Intestine. \nUnderstanding the large \nintestine reflex is easier \nif you consider both \nfeet \ntogether. Picture the large intestine \ngoing up the right side of the \nabdomen, across the \nupper abdomen, and down the left side \n(because \nthis is what it actually does). Now you \ncan imagine how you're affecting \nthis reflex by walking \nyour thumb up the outside of \nthe right foot, across \nthe \ncenter of both feet, then down \nthe outside of the left. \n10. Small \nintestine: \"A man is only as \nhappy as his digestive tract.\" \nThis \nancient saying, \nwhich I just made up this minute, \nhighlights the impor-\ntance of healthily functioning intestines. \nUsing \nyour thumbs to walk helter-skelter in all \ndirections, crisscross \nback and forth over the bottom of \nthe heel, which corresponds to the \nlengthy loops of the small \nintestine. \n11. Hips/knees: Your hips \nand knees are your \nfoundation, and stimulating \nthese \nreflexes can help keep \nyou in balance. \nWalk your \nthumbs along the upper part \nof the foot toward the outer \nedge, midway \nbetween the toes and the heel, moving in \nall directions \naround \nthe general area of the cuboid bone, \nwhich is the little protuber-\nance that sticks out the \nfarthest in the middle of your \nfoot on the \noutside edge. \n12. Sciatic: \nThe largest nerve in your body, \nthe sciatic can be the unfortu-\nnate victim of a \nproportionally large amount of pain. \nUsing the thumb and index \nfinger, pinch all along the back of the base \nof \nthe heel, then up a \ncouple inches along the Achilles \ntendon toward the \ncalf. Repeat several times. \n13. \nReproductive organs: Men and \nwomen, as you've undoubtedly \nnoticed by now, \nhave different reproductive \norgans. But, as it so hap-\npens, the associated \nreflexes are located on the same \nareas of the feet \nfor both sexes. \nHalfway down from the \ncenter of the ankle bones, toward the \nbottom of \nthe heels, \nyou'll find the reflexes for the \nreproductive organs. The \ninner \nankle points correspond to \nthe uterus or prostate, and \nthe outer ankle \npoints \ncorrespond to the ovaries or \ntesticles. Use your thumb or the \ntip \nof your index finger to \n\"hook in\" for a few seconds on \nthese points. You \ncan \nalso walk your thumb up over the top \nof the ankle from one point to \nanother, which stimulates the \nfallopian tubes. \nEFTA00008287\n\n24\n \n0 \nPart IV: \nMassage at \nWork \nWhat to do if you \nfind a problem \nWhile \nyou'reexploring the various reflex areas \non your partners foot, you may come across a \nvery specific \nspot that is significantly more \ntender than \nthe rest. You'll be able to \ntell you've \nhit a tender area, because \nyour partner will sud-\ndenly jerk \nher foot out of your hand and shout \n\"VVhoa, \nwhat's that spot?\" When \nthis happens, \nconsulting your \nreflexology chart, discovering \nthe corresponding reflex, and immediately pro-\nclaiming the presence \nof a  life-threatening \ndisease in,that \narea of the body is \nnot a  good \nidea. Feel free to tell your \npartner which part of \nthe body the tender area represents, but that's \nall you should do. This \nis not a time to show off \nyour \nnewfound knowledge of foot anatomy and \nproclaim yourself a medical \nexpert. \nRather than diagnosing \nher \"illness,\" tell her \nthat if the pain \npersists in that spot, she \nshould \nconsider consulting with her physician and get \na general checkup. You actually may have stum-\nbled upon a viable health \nconcern here. Then \nagain, your partner \nmay have stepped on a tack \nthe day before, in which.case, the tender spot \nyou're hitting in the \ncenter of her left foot is \nsimply \na  boo-boo, not the sign \nof a  diseased \nspleen. \nStimulating the \nreproductive organ reflex points \nfor pregnant women Is \nsaid to help induce labor. \nAlthough I've never heard of a woman \ngoing \ninto \npremature labor due to a massage to the \nfoot, just to play it safe, \nstay \naway from this area completely \nif your partner may possibly be \npregnant. Some \npeople skip foot reflexology \naltogether on potentially \npregnant people for this reason. \n14. \nBladder and kidneys: Save these reflexes \nfor the end of the routine, \nbecause they're \norgans of elimination, and stimulating \nthem promotes \na cleansing \nreaction. \nStarting near the heel, use thumb \nwalking up and back along \nthe arch of \nthe foot, almost up to \nthe ball of the foot. This \nline is a little more onto \nthe \nbottom of the foot than the \nspine reflex (explained in Step 8). \nRepeat \ntwice. \n15. Overall squeeze of \nthe foot: Never finish a \nfoot without saying good-\nbye to it fi\nrst.

They're the ones out there \nliving it up at expensive luxury spas, \ngetting all the massages, right? Not! \nOver the \npast decade, the household Income of the average spa-goer has \ndropped from around $500,000/year down to about $50,000/year. That one \"0\" \nmakes a lot of difference. Today, spas are for everybody. If you're not making \n$50,000/year, don't despair. With the advent of day spas, which I describe in \nthis chapter, the experience of luxury is \nbecoming even more accessible to \npeople from all \nwalks of life. And, if you're steadfastly opposed to spending \nmoney, this chapter also contains a few tips and techniques to turn your very \nown home \ninto a luxury spa, almost for free. \nSpas: More \nthan Just a Pretty Jacuzzi \nSpas are not, as commonly believed, just a kind of Jacuzzi. Although the word \nspa has become interchangeable with hot tub, a spa can also be a really cool \nplace where all kinds of \nexciting things take place, like chardonnay grape \nmassages \nfor instance. \nEFTA00008291\n\n244 \nPad V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nBack in the good old days of King Louis' court in France (it may have been \nLouis \nXV, or \nXIV, or \nperhaps VIP ... I'm \nnot \nsure), \ncertain \nladies-in-waiting \nfound themselves waiting around \nso much that they began feeling jaded. \n\"Another typical almond-oil massage from our love slave, Gregory?\" said one \nlady to the next. \"How boring.\" \nSo, they came up with a new Idea. Their servants filled huge vats with \nsmashed chardonnay grapes, and the ladies proceeded to Jump in au nature! \nfor a total-immersion aromatherapy \nexperience. The sensation was so new, \nand \nthe positive effects of the grapes on their skin so pronounced, that they \ndecided to make It a tradition. \nThus was born an early version of a spa \ntreatment that can still be experi-\nenced today. At the Meadowood Spa in \nNapa Valley, California, for example, \nthey offer a treatment based on this theme (ladies-in-waiting not included). \nThe distilled essence of chardonnay grapes is infused into the massage \ncream used by the massage \ntherapists there. \nChoosing a Spa \nToday, whether you plan to immerse yourself in grapes, or to simply try to \nlose a few pounds and look \nyour best, you can choose from a large array of \nspas to visit. They range from \nsuper-luxurious to down-home rustic. So how \ncl,* \ndo you decide where to go? \nSpas = H2O \nWhat is a spa \nanyway, and what does the word \nspa really mean? Originally, it  was a  Latin \nacronym from \nthe words, Sanitas Per Aqua, \nmeaning health through water. This was a \nphrase favored by the Romans, \nwho took those \nthree words \nwith \nthem everywhere they went, \nincluding a town in modern-day \nBelgium that \nhad healing hot spring \nwaters bubbling out \nof \nthe ground. They called this town Spa, \nperhaps \nalso in  reference to the Latin words 'espa' \n(meaning \"fountain\") and \n'sparse' (from sparg-\nere, meaning, \"to bubble up\"). \nYou can go to Spa, Belgium, and immerse \nyourself in the waters there. Visit 209.41.63. \n136/spa/spa . htni on the Web to find out \nmore. \nEFTA00008292\n\n Chapter 15: The Spa Lifestyle: Massage, Youth, and Beauty 245 \nFirst, \nknowing what kinds of spas are out there helps. Spas fall into three \nbasic categories: \n3 \nDestination spas: This is the King Louis kind of spa, the type of place \nyou go when you want a super special experience. They're called desti-\nnation spas because they are dedicated to the spa experience and \nnothing else. When people visit them, the spa is their final destination, \nand they usually stay for several \ndays to a week. \n3 Resort spas: Becoming more and more popular, \nthese spas are an impor-\ntant part of a larger resort. Guests may travel to the resort for other \nreasons, but many of them take advantage of the spa while they're there. \n3 Day spas: The fast food joints of the spa world. Day spas are places to go \nto receive spa treatments, massages, and more, and you don't have to \ntravel far or stay overnight \nto do so. \nVisiting the spa down the street \nThese days, you can probably find a day spa available right in your very own \nneighborhood. Several multimillion dollar day spas have opened recently, but \nthe majority existed first as hair salons that expanded into spa services. Some \ngood massage is going on at day spas, because many skilled massage thera-\npists are finding work there. \nAlthough the true origins of the term day spa are somewhat shrouded in mys-\ntery, the term is generally attributed to a business woman and spa owner \nfrom Connecticut named Noelle DeCaprlo. She started her day spa in 1978 \nand is credited with being the first \nperson to classify her establishment in \nthis \nmanner. \nWant to give your Aunt Minnie in Cleveland a spa surprise for her birthday \nbut you don't know how to set it up? Just call 1-888-SPA-W1SH (888-772-9474) \nand order a gift certificate that's good for massages, facials, and other treats \nat nearly 800 day spas across the U.S. And check out the coupon at the back \nof this book to receive a discount! \nChoosing a spa that's right for you \nSpas range from rugged adventure \noutposts In the desert to the most puffy \npampering palaces on the planet. You \nhave almost unlimited choices when \nyou're deciding where to go, which is great, but the number of choices may \nalso make \nyour decision kind of difficult. \nEFTA00008293\n\n246 \nPart V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nSome spas, such as the Green Valley \nspa in St. George, Utah, offer rock climb-\ning \non the menu right alongside their massages. Some \nspas expect you to Join \nin on every exhausting 6 a.m. mountain hike they offer. Others leave you \nalone to steep in herbal baths all day. \nSo, \nhow \ndo you choose? \nFirst, decide what's important to you and \nwhat you want to accomplish on \nyour spa trip. This \ncan usually be broken down into a few basic \ncategories: \nfitness, healing, spirituality, \nrelaxation, or some combination of these. \nNext, talk to someone who's been \nthere before, or get the details from a reli-\nable source. Here are three sources that \nmay help you make the right match \nwith a spa: \n3 Get in touch \nwith Spa Finders travel agency and check out their \nmagazine by calling 800-ALL-SPAS \n(800-255-7727) or visiting \nwww.spafinders.com. \n3 Pick up the spa travel guide, Fodor's Healthy Escapes (Fodor's Travel \nPublications), by Bernard Burt, which lists great \nspas of all types in \nmany parts of the world. \n3 The International SPA \nAssociation (ISPA) has a Web site, the Global Spa \nGuide, at www. global s \npaguide . corn, which may help you find the right \nplace for your spa trip. \nSpa Treatments \nSo what do people actually do at spas all \nday, other than get massages and \ndouse themselves in crushed grapes? Believe it or not, they are also in pur-\nsuit of improved health. Yes, that's right. And the way they achieve It \nis to eat \nspa food, follow a \nspa exercise program, and receive what are known as spa \ntreatments, all of which \nare good for you in one way or another. Spa treat-\nments Include: \n3 \nScrubs \n3 Wraps \n3 \nHydrotherapy \n3 \nFacials \n3 \nMud, seaweed, and other messy things \nEFTA00008294\n\nChapter 15: The Spa Lifestyle: Massage, Youth, and Beauty 247 \nif you don't want to travel to one \nof the three types of spas to receive these \ntreatments, you can create them at home for yourself and your family. The \nadvantages of this approach are obvious. First, if \nyou're like most people, you \nlive right in your own \nhome, so you won't have to travel far to get \nthere. Also, \nhaving your husband or wife or best friend wrap you \nin herb-infused sheets is \na lot cheaper than paying a professional wrapper to do it. \nIf \nyou're like most people, a 10-day spa \nvacation in Maui is a little out of \nreach, except perhaps as a \nonce-in-a-lifetime dream vacation. But you can still \ntake advantage of your local day spa a few times a year, and create some spa \nexperiences for yourself at \nhome, each and every week. Each type of spa \ntreatment I list below \nincludes a version you can try at \nhome, and, as you can \nsee, they're not that difficult. \nFor the following treatments, you need a \nvery specialized piece of equipment. \nDon't worry — it's very \ninexpensive, and you can find it in the \nspa depart-\nment of your local drug store. It looks amazingly like a \nsimple 6-pack cooler, \nbut I \ncall it a spa thermal unit Use it to store the hot moist towels that you \nneed \nto wipe off spa goop from \nyour partner's body. \nScrubs \nDuring \ntheir stay at a spa, many people sign up for \nan exfoliation, which is a \nword that comes from that ancient spa \nlanguage, Latin. It means \"to strip away \ndead leaves.\" In other words, It's a fancy name for a body scrub. \nBody \nscrubs are good for you because they \nslough away dead skin cells, \nallowing your skin to breathe again and \npreparing your pores to absorb all \nthose \nenriching ingredients like massage oils from India and mango bath salts \nfrom The \nBody Shop. \nIf you don't have the time or patience to create the entire body \nscrub experi-\nence that follows, try using \na pair of scrub gloves. You can find them in beauty \nsupply stores, drug stores, and gift shops. \nThese textured gloves do the exfo-\nliation for you while you simply rub \nthe skin. No water, soaps, or other \ningredients are needed. \nBody scrub ingredients \nBody scrubs are very easy \nto do. You need just a few simple ingredients: \n3 Loofah sponge \n3 4 cups of warm water in \nbowl \n3 4 hot, moist, wrung\n-out hand towels in an ice chest \nEFTA00008295\n\n248\n Part \nV: Living the Good Life: \nMassage for Every Body  \n3 Washcloth \n3 \n2 bath towels \n3 Body bath \n3 Exfoliant (1/2 cup sea salt with \napproximately 3 tablespoons of water \nand 3 drops of \nessential oil added) \nThe \nexfoliant itself is quite simple. Mix the \nsea salt with water a little at a time \nuntil you have a batter-like \nconsistency, and then add a few \ndrops of your \nfavorite \nessential oil. Any of the many \nover-the-counter skin scrubbing \nprod-\nucts you can buy at \nthe beauty store or department store will \nwork quite \nnicely, too. \nYou may not want to do this \ntreatment on your new $800 silk carpet from \nTurkey, because drips and drops of salt and \nother ingredients do tend to find \ntheir way onto whatever surface you're \nusing. \nStep-by-step \nbody scrub \nThe \nfollowing steps show you how to \ncreate a body scrub that's as nice as \none you \nexperience at a spa. Just make sure to keep \nyour partner warm \nbecause wet bodies cool down \nfast. You can cover the areas \nyou're not work-\ning on with a \ntowel. \nI. With your partner face down \non a bath towel, moisten her back and \nthe back of her \nlegs with a washcloth. \n2. Place a dab of exfollant \nin one palm and use circular \nmovements to \nscrub your partner's \nskin. \n3. Use a hot, moist towel from the \ncooler to wipe off the exfollant. \n4. Dip \nthe loofah sponge in the bowl of \nwater, squeeze a dab of body \nbath onto \nit, and then go back over your partner's skin again \nwith cir-\ncular movements. \n5. Use your second hand towel to wipe the skin. \n6. Have your partner turn over and repeat Steps 1-5 \non the front of the \nlegs, torso, and arms. \nNever use sea salt or body exfoliants on the face. \nYou can purchase exfo-\nHants made \nspecifically for the face in the cosmetics \ndepartments of \nmost major department stores. \n7. When you've finished \nexfoliating the front of the body, apply some \nmassage \nlotion to the skin. \nYou can either do this \napplication of lotion quickly, or you can linger and \nperform an entire massage, depending upon your mood and your \npart-\nner's mood. \nEFTA00008296\n\nChapter15: The Spa Lifestyle: \nMassage, Youth, and Beauty \n249 \n8. Have your partner turn \nover once more, replacing the damp bath \ntowel beneath her \nwith a dry one, and apply skin \nlotion to her back \nand the backs of her legs. \n9. Touch your \npartner's skin (or have somebody else \ntouch it) gingerly, \nexclaiming, \"Ooh, aah, \nyou feel so smooth!\" \nFacials \nAs you may know, the \ncosmetics industry is big business, with \nlots of expen-\nsive products out there for you to buy, but all you need in order to \ngive \nyourself or a partner a very nice \nfacial treatment is a little bit of aloe and a \nripe papaya. You \nnever knew it could be \nso easy, did you? \nFacial \ningredients \nYou have \nto have just a few things ready in order to \nperform a fun and effec-\ntive facial: \nfro \n3 hot moist hand towels in \nyour cooler \nv \nCotton pads \nV Facial toner \nV 1/2 ripe papaya (no \nseeds or skin) blended with 1 \nteaspoon aloe vera gel \niv Skin cream \nStep-by-step facial \nFollow the steps in this section to create a relaxing, \nrejuvenating facial. \n1. Cleanse the face \nwith skin toner and remove any \nmakeup. \n2. Place a hot, moist \ntowel on the face and hold it in \nplace for 2 minutes, \nallowing the pores to open. \nRemember to leave an \nopening for the mouth and nose if \nyou want your \npartner to be able to breathe through this procedure. \n3. Remove the towel and apply the \npapaya/aloe blend in a thin smooth \nlayer over the \nface, using your fingers. \n4. Place \nanother hot towel over the face to keep the mixture moist. \n5. Massage your partner's hands while the face is covered. \n6. Exchange the towel for a warm one after a few minutes and \ncontinue \nmassaging the \nhands. \nEFTA00008297\n\n250 \nPart V: \nLiving the Good \nLife: Massage for Every \nBody  \n7. Remove the \ntowel, wiping \noff whatever's left of the \npapaya/aloe mix-\nture \nwith it. \n8. Using a \nface cream, do the face \nmassage routine in \nChapter 11. \nRemember \nto always stroke \nupwards when you're giving \na facial, like \nprofessional \nestheticians do, so you won't pull \ndown on the delicate col-\nlagen fibers which give your skin its tone. \nWraps \nSome \npeople think that body \nwraps are only good for \nlosing inches. And cer-\ntain wraps can \nhelp you slip into that red \ndress that's been hanging for years \nin the closet. But, as you've \nprobably been told (by everyone \nexcept the \nmanufacturers \nof the wraps), what you're \nreally losing is water \nweight, which \nwill, unfortunately, come back. \nSerious \nhealth spas use wraps \nthat detoxify the body, \nusually known as \nherbal wraps. \nAnd they work by \ntricking your body into \nthinking it has a fever, \ncausing it to purge \nitself of internal toxins. While \nworking as a wrapper at \nbig \nspas, I \nused to routinely unwrap \npeople and find the sheets \npermeated with \nthe \nsmell of nicotine and \nother products that the \nclient's body was purging. \nOther types of \nwraps, like aromatherapy ones, \nfor example, are available, \nbut \nmy favorite is the herbal \nwrap, because It is the most deeply \ndetoxifying, so \nthat's the \none I describe for you here. \nThis \ntreatment is a bit more involved than \nthe others, so only attempt it \nif \nyou're in a truly \nexperimental mode and want to learn by \ntrial and error. \nHerbal wrap ingredients \nGet ready for a fun \nproduction in your kitchen as \nyou prepare the herbal \nwrap, and don't be discouraged if \nthe wrap is not as warm as \nyou'd like the \nfirst time you try. This treatment takes a little practice to do \nwell. \n3 3 ounces of \nherbs — the fresher the better \n(Try a combination of \nchamomile, rosemary, \nlemongrass, and eucalyptus.) \n3 A little bag or piece of \ncheese cloth in which to tie up the herbs for soak-\ning (Even a clean sock will do in a pinch.) \n3 \nA sheet for soaking and wrapping \n3 A big pot to heat water in and \nmake the herbal solution \n3 A \npair of rubber gloves handy so you \ndon't scald your fingers \n-al \nEFTA00008298\n\nChapter 15: The Spa Lifestyle: \nMassage, Youth, and Beauty 251 \nII\n3 A rubberized \nsheet, or space blanket, or piece of plastic (like \na drop \ncloth) \n3 A wool blanket \nHerbal \nwrap step-by-step \nFollow these steps to create a do-it-yourself herbal wrap similar to the type \ngiven \nat great luxury \nspas. \n1. Place the herbs in the cloth, basically creating a big tea bag, and drop \nit in a big pot of hot \n(not boiling) water. \nMaximum \ntemperature should only be around 165 degrees Fahrenheit. \nSoak the \nherbs 20 minutes. Then add the sheet to the pot \nof hot tea and \nlet it soak for a few minutes. \n2. While the sheet is soaking in \nthe herbal tea, lay the wool blanket \ndown, then place the plastic or rubberized sheet on top of it. \n3. Wring the sheet out very well, \nremembering to wear your rubber \ngloves. \nLay the sheet down on top of the plastic and have your partner lie down \non it. In order to make the herbal \nwrap work best, have your partner sit \nIn a hot bath, Jacuzzi, or \nsauna before getting wrapped. \n4. Wrap around your partner the hot \nsheet, then the plastic wrap, and \nthen \nthe wool blanket. \n5. Make sure your partner is comfortable. \nYou can put something beneath his knees and head for support, if \ndesired, and \ngive him a sip of cool water through a straw. Leave him \nwrapped \nfor about 20 minutes, keeping an eye on \nhim. And, if he asks, \nscratch his nose for him (wrapped people often complain of \nitchy \nnoses). \n6. \nWhen you unwrap him, give him some more water and help him sit in \na comfortable chair where he can relax \nfor another 20 minutes, let-\nting the herbs dry \nnaturally on his skin. \nHydrotherapy \nHydrotherapy is a \nword that means, obviously, therapy with \nfire hydrants. Just \nkidding ... but that description is actually quite close to the truth. Would you \nbelieve, for example, that \npeople pay good money in spas to stand naked \nagainst a tile wall while a hydrotherapy expert \nsprays a blast of cold water at \nthem from a pressure hose? It's true \n(this is called a Scotch Hose treatment). \nEFTA00008299\n\n252 \nPart V: Living the \nGood Life: Massage for \nEvery Body  \nHydrotherapy treatments in \nluxury spas can also \ninvolve the use of super-\nexpensive hydrotherapy tubs, which look \nlike a cross between a bathtub and \na \nJacuzzi. You don't need to \nbe in one of these tubs to \nexperience hydrother-\napy. In \nfact, your own bathtub or shower at \nhome will do just fine. \nHere are a few \nideas for taking advantage of \nyour own water source to do a \nlittle \nhydrotherapy at home: \n3 \nBathe \nsomeone. For most of us, the last \ntime we were bathed was in \nearly childhood by our mothers, and we've forgotten how soothing it is. \nUsing a pitcher, pour warm water over your partner's \nhead, shoulders, \nand back in the bath. \nThen wash her slowly and luxuriously. \n3 Take a cold plunge. Many \nspas have what's known as a cold \nplunge, \nwhich is a pool kept at a \nshockingly low temperature. Patrons jump in \nafter being heated up in saunas and whirlpools. You can simulate the \nextremely Invigorating effects of this \nactivity by drawing a cold bath and \nimmersing yourself for 30 \nseconds (or. as long as you can stand it). \n3 Share a bath with a Mend. First, \nmake sure the friend wants to share \nthe bath with you. \nAfter you determine that, \nslip into a tub of warm \nwater with 10 drops of \naromatherapy oll added, and see what happens \nnext. It may not be entirely therapeutic, but it \ncertainly will be fun. \nExercise \n... a day of pleasure \nThe spa lifestyle is for everyone —unless unless \nyou're the type who \ndisdains pleasure and \nhealth, like the flagellant monks \nof the Middle \nAges, for example, who used to wander around \nthe streets beating themselves with \nsticks. If \nthat's your idea \nof fun, definitely stay away from \nanything to do with spas. \nlf, \non the other hand, you.have \nwhat it.takes to \ntreat yourself to \nsome healthy enjoyment in life, \nwhy not plan an entire day of spa pleasures? \nThe sultans used \nto do it, and so did.Cleopatra \nwith rose petals a foot \nthick °lithe floor of her \nlove chamber. But how about you? \nYou can recreate a day of luxury just like the \nones people experience at spas. Trade each \ntreatment with a lucky partner and spend.the \nday together. Then go out and \ncelebrate your \nindulgence with a healthy meal at a restaurant. \nThe whole \nexchange (not including dinner) \ntakes \nabout 5 hours. Just follow these simple \nsteps: \n1. First start with a body scrub to cleanse the \nskin and prepare you to absorb \nthe healthy \n&Mutsu' the oils and other ingredients to \nfollow. \n2.  Take turns soaking \nin a  bath (or soak \ntogether \nif you're so inclined), with \na dozed \ndrops of your favorite aromatherapy \noil or \na few ounces \nof healing herbs added. \n3. Exchange long \nluxurious massages, fol-\nlowing along with \nthe step-by-step \ninstructions in Chapter 11. \n4.  Give each other a \nspa facial to prepare \nyourselves for reentry into the world. \nEFTA00008300\n\n Chapter \n15: The \nSpa Lifestyle: Massage, Youth, and Beauty \nMud, \nseaweed, and other messy things \nOther kinds of spa treatments work, too, but I don't go into them here, \nbecause if you tried them at home you may mess up your furniture or carpet. \nThese treatments involve the use of such products as mud, seaweed, and \nclay\n—and \nthey can be really \nmessy! If you do experiment with these prod-\nucts (many of which are available at cosmetics counters and in beauty \nsupply \nstores), try to confine your activities to the bathroom, where you're less \nlikely to stain things. \nMassage-O-Matic Speciatty Stores \nWhen you're searching for \nitems to create your own spa or massage environ-\nment at home, try checking out a new type of outlet \nknown as the massage \nspecially store. Until \nrecently, this type of store didn't even exist, but now \nthey're popping up in many locations. If you ever find yourself \nnear one of \nthem, you \nreally should pay a visit, because they're quite cool. And don't be \nintimidated by the New Age feel \nat some of these places. Everyone is allowed \nInside, not just crystal-toting members of the massage avant-garde. \nThree basic types of massage-oriented \nstorefronts exist: \n3 Manufacturers' outlets \n3 Ergonomic specialists \n3 Massage-o-matics \nManufacturers' outlets \nSome of the companies that manufacture equipment such as tables and \nchairs for massage pros have also begun \nexperimenting with selling their \nwares \ndirectly to the public. These companies are still concentrated in \nthat \nglobal hotbed of \nmassage \ninnovation, \nCalifornia, although \nthey exist else-\nwhere as well.

This \nkiosk take on the massage \nphenome-\nnon is ideal for people \ntraveling through airports or \nrushing through big \ncities.

Yes, \nyou. Are you \nplanning on stretching much before you jump Into that game? If \nyou're like most part-time athletes, \nyou're probably not guilty of over-\nstretching. Am I right? \nIt's Just such a hassle. Well, this is \nanother arena \nwhere massage can come In handy. What could be better than having some-\none stretch your muscles for \nyou? That, and much more, is precisely what \nyou can do with sports \nmassage. And you get the lowdown on it in \nthis chapter. \nWhen \nthe Going Gets \nTough, \nthe Tough Get a \nMassage \nIf you're a serious athlete, chances are pretty good you probably understand \nthe benefits of massage already. \nMost competing athletes think massage is \nvaluable to athletic \nperformance. Just look at top \nOlympic competitors, many \nof whom have used massage for years to \ngain an extra edge. In fact, beginning \nin 1996, massage became an official part of the services offered to all athletes \nin the Olympic Village \nitself. \nAthletes utilize massage in a number of \nways: \n0\n V \nTo rehabilitate after \ngetting injured in their sport \nPo To recover from \nintense workouts and competition \nEFTA00008305\n\n258\n \nPart \nV: Living the Good Life: \nMassage for Every Body  \n0\n 3 To maintain optimal \nmuscle tone and flexibility on an ongoing basis \n3 To appear relaxed and \ncool getting their massages In front of the compe-\ntition \nat big events \nGood times to use \nsports massage \nYou can \nuse sports massage any time you \nwant, even right before church on \nSunday morning, or at \nmidnight after drinking margaritas \nall evening at the \nannual company Fourth of July party. But \nusing sports massage right around \nthe time \nyou're going to be engaging in the sport Just plain \nmakes more sense, \ndon't you think? And that \nbasically boils down to three \ndifferent occasions: \n3 Pre-event massage: As the name would imply, this type of sports mas-\nsage is used by athletes directly before the \nevent. And, contrary to \npopular belief, a massage at \nthis time will not zone the \nathlete out to a \nstate of \nzombiehood, but rather invigorate \nher further in preparation for \ncompetition. \n3 Post-event \nmassage: Directly after an event (like just past \nthe finish line \nat the Boston Marathon), is a \nplace and time that athletes almost \nuniver-\nsally appreciate a \ngood massage. Massage \nhelps the muscles, not to \nmention the psyche, \nrecover more quickly. \n3 \nOngoing \ntraining massage: Getting massaged throughout the \ntraining \ncycle \nis more and more popular with many \nathletes. Some even receive \nmassage every day. \nWhere to find sports massage \nIf you live in \na large metropolitan area, chances \nare good that you have a \nsports massage clinic \nsomewhere close by. If you live in a small town, \ntry \ninquiring at your local osteopath or chiropractor's \noffice. They may know \nsomeone who offers sports massage. \nMassage pros go through a special advanced training in \norder to become cer-\ntified sports massage therapists. \nYou won't offend anyone by asking \nabout \ntheir certification and where they got it. So if \nyou're really looking for a quali-\nfied person, check out their qualifications. Makes sense, doesn't It? \nAthletic trainers are quite \noften sports massage therapists also, or they can \nat \nleast \nrecommend one. Beware, though, of the \ntrainer who thinks he's doing \nsports massage \nJust because he knows how to give a few karate chops \nto your \nback. He may be doing you a disservice, and \nhe probably doesn't understand \nthat true professional \nsports massage is becoming a highly \nevolved discipline. \nThe days of Rocky Balboa's coach \ngiving him a shoulder rub along with a \nmoti-\nvational \nspeech before the big fight are over. \"And if \nhe gets up, hit him again!\" \nEFTA00008306\n\n \nChapter 16: Higher, Faster, Stronger: Sports Massage \n259 \nCall the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) at 847-864-0123, and \nthey will provide you with the name of someone on their National Sports \nMassage Team (NSMT). \nThe Techniques \nSports massage, when applied by skilled practitioners, is an advanced form \nof massage therapy, with many involved maneuvers. The Instructions here \nare not meant to make you an expert. They simply suggest a couple of moves \nthat can help ease the strains of the weekend warriors in your life, including \nyou. In other words, after reading this chapter, don't go out and \nannounce \nyourself as a special trainer for Olympic marathon runners. That should be left \nto the pros. \nSporty modes \nThis section provides you with some basic sports massage moves. \nNotice \nhow they're similar to \nregular massage moves? It's just that they're bigger \nand often deeper, and certain moves are used much more frequently during \nsports massage then, say, \nduring a relaxation massage. \nCompression \nOften in sports, overworked and overtired muscles have to be pressed into \nsubmission. \nWith this \nmove, shown In Figure 16-1a, you can \napply enough \ndirect pressure to help relieve muscle spasms and provide a calming effect to \nthe area. \nCross-fiber friction \nYou may remember the term cross-fiber from Chapter 10. Then again, you \nmay not. And you may be thinking to yourself, what the heck is cross\n-fiber \nfriction anyway? Don't \nfret: Cross-fiber friction is simply the use of some rela-\ntively Intense rubbing across the opposite direction that the muscle fibers \nrun \nin \nany \nparticular \narea, as you can see in Figure 16-1b. \nThis technique is \nespecially good for muscle fibers that are put under strain during sports. \nDeep pressure \nPeople who work out a lot often end up creating some really sore spots along \nwith the improved tone in their bodies. Pinpointing these sore spots can be \ntricky, but after you do, treat them to some direct deep pressure, as shown in \nFigure 16-1c, to help release knotted, cramped, and contracted muscle tissues. \nEFTA00008307\n\n260\n \nPart V: Living the Good Life: \nMassage for Every Body  \nKneading \nWhen you're kneading an athlete, \nyou want to make sure your motions are \nbig and \nstrong, and that your hands grasp as \nmuch muscle tissue as possible. \nSee Figure 16-1d, and \nrefer to Chapter 10 for the three steps of kneading, \nwhich are squeezing, rolling, and pushing. \nFigure \n16-1: \nCompres&on \n(a),\ncross-fibr \nfrietionlb), \ndeep \npros-\nsure(c), and \nkneading(d). \nStretches \nncr Stretches feel \nreally good to people who've \nbeen using their muscles a lot in \nsporting \nactivities, but be careful not to over-stretch people and possibly \ninjure them. Always ask for feedback from your partner \nwhile you're perform-\ning the stretch, and always err on \nthe side of not-enough stretch rather than \nforcing it toward too\n-much. \nHamstring stretch \nWith your partner lying on her back, lift one leg up, \nsupporting it firmly at the \nankle and on the hamstrings \nthemselves, as you push the leg slowly and \nsteadily back toward the head. Don't lock \nthe knee during this maneuver. \nHold the stretch for 5 to 10 seconds, and then release (see Figure 16.2a). You \ncan add more impact by having your \npartner push back against your hands \nduring the \nstretch, then release while you stretch the \nleg a little farther. \nEFTA00008308\n\n Chapter 16: Higher, Faster, \nStronger: Sports Massage \n26 \nQuad stretch \nThe quadriceps muscles in the \nfront of the thigh get especially tight on runners \nand other athletes. A good way to stretch them is to have your partner lie face \ndown, raise her leg up to 90 degrees, then lift her foot straight up while also \nlifting beneath her knee with \nyour other hand, as shown in Figure 16-2b. Only \nlift \nuntil you feel the natural resistance of \nher muscles. For an extra stretch on \nlimber \npartners, bring the foot closer to the \nbuttocks at the same time. \nCalf \nstretch \nWhen you stretch the calf, you stretch the Achilles tendon, too, which is \nextremely strong. So don't be afraid to \ngive a deep stretch here by \ncupping \nthe heel and pressing your \nforearm firmly against the bottom of the foot, \nmoving the toes toward the head, as shown in Figure 16-2c. \nArm stretch \nLift the hand up \nover the head, pulling up slightly on the elbow, as shown in \nFigure 16-2d. This stretch is easier to do \non a massage table, but if you don't \nhave access to a table, just try \nbending your partner's elbow out to the side a \nlittle first \nuntil you get her arm into the correct position. \n044\" \nlatat \nFigure \n16-2 \nStretches \nfor \nthe \nhamstring(a), \nquad(b), \ncalifs), and \nEFTA00008309\n\n262\n \nPart V: Living the Good \nLife: Massage for Every Body  \nRoutines \nYou can perform an entire \nsports massage routine, which is \ngoing to look sim-\nilar to the \nregular routine you discover in \nChapter 11, except that \nyour \npartner will be wearing \nan athletic outfit instead of a towel! But that's \nnot the \nonly difference. You'll also be using a lot more cross\n-fiber friction, compres-\nsion, and deep kneading, \nfocusing on the muscles that have \ndone the \nexertion. And some extra stretching aids \nin recovery, too. Other than that, \nthough, don't \nbe too surprised if sports massage looks \namazingly similar to \nnon-sports massage. \nA Pain in the Elbow, \na Pain in the Butt \nAthletes run into all \nkinds of problems because they push their muscles to \nthe limits, and certain sports are famous for causing \ncertain pains. You've \nprobably heard of tennis \nelbow, for example, and runner's \ncramps, both of \nwhich are \nproblems that can be helped \nwith sports massage. \nTennis etbouf \nTennis elbow is a slow, creeping, \ndebilitating condition that can really make \nyou unhappy over a long period of time. This condition is a \nswelling of the \ntendons in the forearm near \nthe elbow and an irritation of \nthe muscles there \ncaused by repetitive use. Of \ncourse, the best thing to do when you start \nnoticing this type of pain is to stop doing what's causing it \n(namely, playing \ntennis). Some people don't \nwant to stop playing tennis, \nthough. In that case, \ntry \ntaking a break just for a few days, using \nice to reduce soreness in the area. \nAlso, a physician may be able to help by prescribing anti-inflammatory drugs, \nso check with your doctor. \nA little \nsports massage can help tennis \nelbow, too. Remember to do some \ngradual warm-up massage moves first before digging straight in with these \ntwo rather intense maneuvers. Also, \napply ice for 5 to 10 minutes beforehand \nto reduce \ninflammation. Then follow these steps: \n1. Supporting the arm at the wrist, with \nthe elbow resting on the floor or \nmassage table, grasp \nyour partner's forearm and slide your \nhand \ndown slowly from her wrist toward \nthe elbow, as shown in \nFigure 16-3a. \nRepeat this move several times with \nyour hand in differ-\nent positions so your thumb presses against \nthe entire forearm. \nEFTA00008310\n\n \nChapter16: \nHigher, \nFaster, \nStronger. \nSports \nMassage \n263 \n2. \nUsing \nthe \ntips \nof \nyour \nfi\nngers \nor \nthumbs, \napply \ncross\n-fiber \nfriction \nto \nthe \nmuscles \non \ntop \nof \nthe \nforearm \nnear \nthe \nelbow, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n16-3b. \nThis \nis \nthe \narea \nmost \ndirectly \naffected \nin \ntennis \nelbow, \nso \ntake \nit \neasy \non \nyour \npartner, \nusing \nmore \nice \nif \nnecessary \nto \nlessen \ndiscomfort. \nApply \nmore \nsqueezing, \ngliding, \nand \na \nlittle \nkneading \nafterwards \nto \nhelp \nsmooth \nthings \nout. \nFigure \n16-3: \nSqueeze \nthe \nforearm \nmuscles \nand \npush \nslowly \ndown \ntoward \nthe \nelbowiek \nthen \napply \ndeep \nfriction \nto \nthe \nfore-\narm \nmuscles \nnear \nthe \nelbowfb). \nRunner's \ncramps \nRunners \noften \nget \nmuscle \ncramps \nIn \ntheir \ncalves, \nhamstrings, \nquads, \nor \nbut-\ntocks \nafter \npushing \nthemselves \nto \nthe \nlimit. \nIf \nyou've \never \nbeen \nthe \nvictim \nof \nrunner's \ncramps, \nyou \nknow \nthat \nthey \nare \nnot \nfun \nat \nall. \nThese \ncramps \ntake \nover \nyour \nleg \nlike \nan \ninvading \nalien \nfrom \nthe \nlatest \nepisode \nof \nStar \nTrek, \nand \nthey \nshow \nno \nmercy. \nIf \nyou're \nstanding \nat \nthe \ntime \nthe \ncramp \nstarts, \nyou \nbegin \nlimping \naround \nand \nscreaming \nlike \na \nmaniac. \nAnd \nif \nyou're \nlying \ndown, \nthe \ncramp \nis \neven \nworse. \nThe \nfollowing \ntechniques \nmay \nhelp \nthe \nnext \ntime \nsomeone \nyou \nknow \nfalls \nvictim \nto \na \ncharley \nhorse. \nFor \nover \na \ncentury \nnow, \nrunner's \ncramps \nhave \nalso \nbeen \nknown \nby \nthe \nterm \ncharley \nhorse, \nwhich \noriginally \ncame \nfrom \nthe \nworld \nof \nbaseball. \nNo \none \nknows \nfor \nsure \nwho \nCharley \nwas, \nor \nwhy \nhe \nhad \na \nlame \nhorse, \nthough \nsome \npeople \nsay \nhe \nwas \na \ngroundskeeper \nat \na \nSioux \nCity \nballpark. \nMake \nsure \nthe \nathlete \ndrinks \nplenty \nof \nfluids \nto \ncounter \nthe \ncramping \neffects \nof \ndehydration. \nAnd \nafter \nthe \nmassage, \ntry \nplacing \nsome \nice \non \nthe \narea \nfor \na \nfew \nminutes \nto \nfurther \nreduce \nsoreness. \nEFTA00008311\n\n264 \nPart V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nWhen a \ncramp strikes, follow these steps to help ease the athlete's pain: \n1.

After a few seconds, release the pressure and apply a stretch to the \nmuscle that is cramping, as shown in Figure 16-4b. \n3. Grasping at the far end of the muscle on either side of the spasm \nitself, push the muscle fibers in \ntoward the middle, as shown in \nFigure 16-4c. \nHold for \nseveral seconds. \n4. Have your \npartner contract the opposing muscles, which in \nFigure 16-4d are the muscles in front of the lower leg, near the shin. \nThis technique will have the effect of further loosening the cramping \nmuscle. \n5. \netch gently one more time. \nrihrors\n6410:41\nFyne 16-4: \nRelief for a \ncramping \nmuscle. \n.4 \nEFTA00008312\n\nChapter\n \n17 \nTaking \nIt \nWith \nYou: \nMassage \nOn \nthe \nGo \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO \n0 \n000000000000000000 \nIn \nThis \nChapter \nr> \nReceiving \nmassage \naround \nthe \nworld \nD \nGetting \nmassaged \nwhile \non \nthe \nroad \nD \nUsing \nmassage \nto \nrelax \nwhile \nflying \nW\nt\nherever \nyour \nhands \ncan \ngo, \nmassage \ncan \ngo, \ntoo. \nAnd \nthere's \nno \nlimit \no \nthe \nstrange \nand \nwonderful \nenvironments \nyou \ncan \nfind \nyourself \nin \nwhen \nseeking \nout \nprofessional \nmassage \nor \nexchanging \none \nwith \na \ntraveling \npartner. \nThe \nonly \nproblem \nis, \nyou \nhave \nto \nget \nto \nyour \ndestination \nin \norder \nto \nenjoy \nthe \nmassage \noffered \nthere, \nand \nthe \ngetting\n-there \npart \noften \ncauses \nquite \na \nbit \nof \ntension. \nThat's \nwhy \nI \nshare \na \ncoach\n-class \nmassage \nwith \nyou \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthis \nchapter, \nto \nhelp \nmake \ngetting \nthere \na \nlittle \nless \nof \na \npain. \nOne \nWorld, \nMany \nMassages \nIf \nyou \ntravel \naround \nmuch \nand \nreceive \nmassages \nin \ndifferent \nparts \nof \nthe \nworld, \none \nthing \nyou'll \nnotice \npretty \nquickly \nis \nthat \neach \nculture \nhas \nits \nown \ndistinct \nattitudes \nabout \nmassage \nand \nits \nown \nunique \nideas \nabout \nwhat \na \nmas-\nsage \nshould \nbe. \nIn \nTurkey, \nfor \nexample, \nthe \nmassage \nyou \nreceive \nin \na \ntraditional \nhamam, \nor \nbathhouse, \nmay \ninclude \na \ntremendously \nvigorous \nrub-\ndown \nin \na \nbig \nsteamy \nchamber \nby \na \nsilent \ngiant \nwho \nis \napparently \nindifferent \nto \nyour \ndiscomfort, \nor \nyour \nbliss, \nfor \nthat \nmatter. \nOn \nthe \nother \nextreme, \na \nmassage \non \na \ncruise \nship \nsailing \nthe \nwarm \nwaters \nof \nthe \nCaribbean \nmay \nbe \nan \nairy\n-light, \nsoothing \nexperience \ngiven \nto \nyou \nby \na \nsensitive \nand \ndelicate \nEnglish \nwoman. \nEFTA00008313\n\n266\n \nPart V: Living \nthe Good Life: Massage for Every \nBody  \nJust say the word \nWherever you are in the- \nworld, people often \nappreciate it if you attempt afewwords of their \nlanguage.

Day \nafter day, for thousands of miles, with their butts \nglued into high-bucket seats, they roll across \nthe countryside, their necks, shoulders, \nand \nbacks getting more and more tense as they go. \nYou can't get much \ntougher than truckers. \nThey're not the type to \ncomplain, but recently \neven they, too, have seen the light about mas-\nsage. The \nTriple T Truck Stop in Arizona now \noffers therapeutic massage to the \nguys and gals \nhauling goods in their big rigs across \nthe U.S. \nIf you've ever had any thoughts along \nthe lines \nof, \"I'm too tough for massage. That's for \nwusses who can't stand pain,\" just consider the \nexample of the truckers. \nIf they see the \nvalue of massage therapy, it's \ngood enough for me — \nand for youl \nMassage in \nCoach Cass \nThe \ntoughest thing about travel is \nthat it involves an awful lot of \nmoving \naround, often in air-tight steel tubes hurtling through the upper atmosphere. \nAir travel is one sure way to get \nstressed out. Whoever uttered that famous \nphrase, \"Life is a journey, not a destination,\" \nprobably wasn't sitting In coach \nclass on a transoceanic flight at the time. \nAlthough there's just no way to get what you need \nthe most on flights \n(namely, a hot shower and lots of fresh oxygen), you can still offer yourself or \nyour traveling companions a little relief with a coach-class massage. By the \nway, this technique works equally well in first or business class, although it \nmay not be \nquite as necessary. \nThe coach-class self-massage \nImagine yourself sitting in your coach-class seat like a good little passenger, \nall packed in like fruitcake in a tin, when \nsuddenly the thought strikes you \nthat you are, indeed, exceedingly uncomfortable, \nand you need to do some-\nthing about it. You've already stood up twice to stretch, climbing all over \nother passengers to do so. Nothing seems to help. \nThe time to try massage has arrived. The five-step routine shown here is \nespecially good for relieving tension In your sinus area, which can become \nsore due to \ncabin air \npressure changes and \ndehydration. Just follow these \nsteps and take a look at Figure 17-1: \nEFTA00008316\n\nChapter17: \nTaking \nIt \nWith \nYou: \nMassage \nOn \nthe \nGo \n269 \n1. \nLean \nforward \nslightly \n(not \ntoo \nfar, \nor \nelse \nyou'll \nbang \nyour \nhead \ninto \nthe \ntray \ntable \nof \nthe \nseat \nIn \nfront \nof \nyou), \nand \nhook \nyour \nthumbs \ninto \nthe \ntender \nneck \nmuscles \njust \nbelow \nthe \nbony \nridge \nat \nthe \nbase \nof \nyour \nskull. \nPress \nin \nhere, \nmaking \nlittle \ncircles \nwith \nyour \nthumbs \nas \nyou \napply \nfirm \npressure, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n17\n-la. \n2. \nUse \nyour \nthumbs \nto \npress \nin \nto \nthe \nupper \ninner \ncorner \nof \nyour \neyes, \nright \nnext \nto \nthe \nnose, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n17-1b. \nPressure \nagainst \nthe \nnose \nbones \ncan \nhelp \nrelieve \nsinus \nsoreness. \nIf \nyou're \nwearing \nglasses, \ntake \nthem \noff \nfirst. \nAnd \nif \nyou're \nwearing \ncon-\ntacts, \ndon't \npress \ndirectly \nagainst \nthem \nthrough \nyour \nclosed \neyelids. \nThis \nmove \ncan \nbe \ndone \nvery \ndiscreetly, \nbut \nif \nyou \nend \nup \nsitting \nnext \nto \nsomeone \nwho \nlooks \nat \nyou \nstrangely, \njust \nsmile, \npoint \nat \nyour \nown \nhead, \nand \nsay, \n\"Sinus \ntrouble. \nIf  \nI \ndon't \ndo \nthis \nmy \neyes \nwill \nfall \nout.\" \n3. \nWith \nfirm \npressure, \nmake \nfingertip \ncircles \non \nyour \ntemples, \nmoving \nthe \nskin \nand \nmuscle \nover \nthe \nbone \nbelow \nwhile \nkeeping \nyour \nfingers \nfirmly \nanchored \nto \none \nspot \non \nthe \nskin \n(see \nFigure \n17-1c). \n4. \nPress \nstraight \nin \non \nthe \ntemples \nand \nhold \nfor \n5 \nto \n10 \nseconds \n(as \nshown \nin \nFigure \n17-14 \nYou \nmay \nalso \ntry \nmoving \nyour \njaw \naround \na \nbit \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime, \nwhich \nwill \nallow \nyou \nto \npress \nat \nslightly \ndifferent \ndepths \ninto \nthe \nmuscles. \n5. \nPress \nthe \nheels \nof \nyour \nhands \ninto \nboth \nsides \nof \nyour \nhead, \nabove \nthe \nears, \ncompressing \nthe \njunction \nbetween \nyour \nparietal \nbones \nand \nyour \ntemporal \nbones \n(as \nshown \nin \nFigure \n17-1e). \nHold \nthis \nfor \nup \nto \n30 \nseconds. \nIt \noften \nhelps \nreduce \nheadaches \nand \ntake \npressure \noff \nyour \npoor \nskull \nin \nthose \npressurized \nairplane \ncabins. \nBe \ncareful \nnot \nto \nwallop \nthe \npassengers \non \neither \nside \nof \nyou \nwith \nyour \nelbows \nwhen \nperforming \nthis \nmaneuver. \nA \ncouple \nextra \ntips \nTry \nstretching \nyour \nlegs \nout \na \nlittle \nand \npushing \nseveral \npoints \nalong \nthe \nout-\nside \nof \nyour \nthighs \n(being \ncareful \nnot \nto \nkick \nthe \nperson \nin \nthe \nseat \nin \nfront \nof \nyou \nand \ncause \na \nmid-air \nscene!). \nThen \nbend \nforward \na \nbit \nand \nreach \nunder-\nneath \nyour \nknees \nto \nmassage \nthe \nupper \ncalves. \nIf  \nyou \nhave \nstuffy \nsinuses, \nand \nnothing \nelse \nhas \nhelped, \ntry \ndoing \nwhat \nthe \nscuba \ndivers \ndo: \nPinch \nyour \nnose \nshut \nand \nblow \ngently \ninto \nit \n(be \ncareful \nnot \nto \nblow \ntoo \nhard). \nThis \nsimple \ntechnique \noften \nequalizes \npressure \ninside \nand \noutside \nyour \nhead. \nAh \n... \nrelief. \nEFTA00008317\n\n270 \nPart V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body \nFigure 17-1: \nYour coach-\nclass \nmassage. \nEFTA00008318\n\nChapter \n18 \nMassage \nfor \nthe \nWhole \nFamily \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n• \nC \no \n0 \n0 \nC \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOO \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nIn \nThis \nChapter \nD \nSharing \nmassage \nwith \nyour \nwhole \nfamily \np \nMassaging \nyour \nbaby \np  \nEnjoying \nmassage \nduring \npregnancy \nGiving \nmassage \nto \nseniors \nW\nelcome \nto \nthe \nmom-and-pop \nchapter \nof \nthis \nbook, \nthe \none \nthat \ngives \nyou \nthat \nwarm \nand \nfuzzy \nfeeling \ninside. \nYes, \nyou \ncan \ninclude \nevery-\nbody \nin \nthe \nfamily \nin \nyour \nnewfound \npassion \nfor \nmassage, \nfrom \nnewborn \nbabies \nright \nup \nthrough \nGrandma \nand \nGrandpa. \nAll \nit \ntakes \nis \na \nlittle \ncreativity \non \nyour \npart, \nand \nthe \nwillingness \nto \nshare \nyour \nnewfound \nskills. \nAlt \nin \nthe \nFamily \nElaine, \na \nsales \nmanager \nfrom \nLiving \nEarth \nCrafts \nmassage \nmanufacturing \ncom-\npany \nin \nCalifornia, \nput \nit \nbest: \n\"The \nfamily \nthat \nmassages \ntogether, \nstays \ntogether.\" \nThat \nmakes \nsense. \nIf \nyou \ncan't \nshare \nmassage \nwith \nyour \nfamily, \nwho \ncan \nyou \nshare \nit \nwith, \nright?
