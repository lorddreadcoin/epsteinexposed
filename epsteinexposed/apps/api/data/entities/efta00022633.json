He's investigating (what he believes is) an \nambulance which operated out of Epstein's compound. Just forwarding along, FWIW. Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:35 PM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nSubject: Re: SDNY raid on Little Saint James \nMr. =, \nThank you for the reply. On the Ambulance issue I confirmed through Ms. at USVI EMS the \nfollowing. \n1. The vehicle has no registration of any kind. Required are Certificate of Need, ALS and BLS certification, \nMedical Director, Protocols, Staff providing care need to be USVI certified. These are huge violations of law. \nNone of these requirements we even attempted to be obtained. \n2. To import a vehicle of this type, the above requirements need to be in compliance. No record if it's \nimportation is on record with USVI EMS. This could mean \nA. Some corruption in customs allowed its importation. \nOr \nB. It was smuggled via shipping container. \n3. It holds a USVI license plate. Registering a vehicle of this type would be impossible, considering the above \nitems. It was however able to obtain a tag from BMV. \nWe confirmed through FDLE the vehicle was NOT listed on his Sex Offender Registration as his many other \nvehicles are. \nI will attach several screen shots of drone video we obtained from YouTube channel Rusty Shackleford . In the \nfinal picture the Ambulance appears to have been moved or removed from the property. \nThis is Ms. email \nI gave her yours also. I believe they are doing an official investigation and would be glad to cooperate. I am \navailable if I can be of any further help. \nOur viewers, and I think the public in general, are not happy with what happened with Epstein. As I'm sure \nSDNY is not. The questions we hear most, and are trying to answer with factual information are: \nEFTA00022633\n\n1. Is this video an official raid? \n2. Why did it take so long? \n3. Has this, and all his properties been searched and seized? \nAnswers to these questions would do much to restore the public's confidence in the investigation, as well as \nthose victims yet to come forward. A statement from SDNY would be welcomed. \nDo you think a  statement will be forthcoming? If so when? Thank you again for your time and attention. \nGodspeed with the Epstein case. \nPS: You might have already done this, but the Rusty Shackleford videos showed a lot of activity going on prior to \nthe raid. Think this would be valuable if evidence was being removed or destroyed. \nRegards, \nJ Taylor \nI lost Traffick Report Show \nbig \nEFTA00022634\n\nSent from my iPhone \n> On Aug 14, 2019, at 12:49 PM, \n(USANYS) \nwrote: \n> Thanks very much for the call, I'll decline to comment at this time. \n> And if you want to share any of the information , you can forward anything to this email. \n> Public Affairs \n> United States Department of Justice \n> U.S. Attorney's Office 'Southern District of New York \n'Mobile: Press Office: \n> \n----Original Message---\n> From: John Taylor \n> Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:38 AM \n> To: =, Nicholas \n(USANYS) \n> Subject: SDNY mid on Little Saint James \n> Mr. \n> Per our phone conversation please send us a statement (press release) on the recent Task Force raid on LSJ.
