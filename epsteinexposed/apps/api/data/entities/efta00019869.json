As we've previously discussed, \nI'm attaching a trial subpoena requiring to testify at our trial, which is scheduled to begin on November 29, \n2021. I expect we will call to testify sometime in early December 2021 during that trial. \nAfter our prep tomorrow, I do not think we will need to meet with again until we get closer to trial. I'll plan to \nreach back out in early November to arrange for a VTC on which we can conduct a refresher prep session and to arrange \nfor travel and hotel for trial. \nThanks and see you tomorrow. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00019869",
