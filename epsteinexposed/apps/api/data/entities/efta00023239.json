We remain committed to getting to the bottom of this puzzling \ninflux of cash. Is there any guidance the office can provide that there is interest in the financial issues raised by \nthe Epstein affair, even after his death. \nFinally we have been told that the offices of Southern Trust were searched on Aug. 12-- the same day authorities \nsearch Epstein's island residence. Can you confirm? \nWe also have been told by an eyewitness that two weeks before Epstein's arrest, there were several large garbage \nbags with shredded documents seen outside the office door to Southern Trust. Do you know anything about this? \nIf nothing else, I  hope we can engage some discussion on these issues. As much as we are committed to solving \nthe many mysteries of Epstein's financial business, we want to separate fact from fiction and fact from Internet \nconspiracies \nbest \nmatt \nhttps://www.nytimes.corn/2019/10/03/business/jeffrey-epstein-southern-trust.html \nMatthew Goldstein \nThe New York Times \n(w) 212-556-1665 \n(c) 347-843-9938 \n®mattgoldstein26 \nEFTA00023239",
