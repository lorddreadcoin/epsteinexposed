If \ntrue, I  understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order. \nLeaving that aside I  want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of \nWednesday, he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally \nnothing to read, listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the \naccompanying batteries. \nMost troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been \nreturned to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive \nwork product that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to \nprepare for our next meeting. When I  saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the \ndocuments he was working with when he was taken from the cell. I  am very concerned that these documents have \nEFTA00028385\n\nbeen seized by the staff at MCC. Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him \nimmediately. \nLastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward. \nBruce A.
