First, this goes beyond what we said we would do or told the court we would do. Second, in \nany event, we are separately gathering any potentially relevant emails from the agent with victims or witnesses. Third, we \nhave no reason to believe there were significant gaps in retention or collection for such that we would expect \nthat any of his emails with her would be in what we already have. \nOn Oct 9, 2020, at 9:05 PM, \nChiefs, \n> \nwrote: \nToday, we spoke with SA one of the original FBI agents from the Florida investigation of Epstein. \ntold us he has a number of emails with AUSA regarding the case. Our view is that we do not need to collect \nthose emails from because we have already received thousands of emails, which were collected by OPR \nand should encompass any emails with the FBI about the Epstein case. is going to send us any emails he received \nfrom victims or witnesses. We also discussed other documents has in his possession from the Epstein \ninvestigation and asked him to send us any that sounded potentially discoverable. \nPlease let us know if this approach sounds right to you or if you would like to discuss. \nThanks, \nEFTA00013243",
