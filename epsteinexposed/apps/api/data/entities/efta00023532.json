Motto Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York. New York 10007 \nJuly \n1, 2021 \nVIA ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States \nCourthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to bring to the Court's attention an opinion \npiece (the \"Op-Ed\") published yesterday in the New York Daily News, which was authored by \nDavid Markus, Esq., who represents the defendant in connection with this case. Mr. Markus's \nstatements in the Op-Ed were in violation of Local Rule 23.1, which contains provisions relating \nto extrajudicial public statements by attorneys. Accordingly, for the reasons stated below, the \nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court order Mr. Markus to comply with Local Rule \n23.1. \nA. Mr. Markus's Statements to the Media \nDavid Markus represents the defendant in connection with appellate matters in this case. \nIn particular, Mr. Markus has handled the defendant's bail appeals in this case, including an \nargument on her behalf in the Second Circuit. As the Court may recall, on April 14, 2021, Mr. \nMarkus emailed Chambers requesting permission to bring electronics to the courthouse to attend \nthe defendant's arraignment on the superseding indictment. The Court informed Mr. Markus that \nhe would need to file a notice of appearance before making such an application to the Court. Mr. \nMarkus did not file a notice of appearance, but he attended the arraignment and spoke to members \nof the media thereafter.' \nI See Stephen Rex Brown, Ghislaine Marvell Makes First Court Appearance, N.Y. Daily News (Apr. 23, 2021), \nhttp :Thinvw.nyda ilynews.corn/new-york/ny-ghisla ine-maxwell-arra ignment-20210423-\nb3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html (quoting Mr. Markus, speaking outside the courthouse following the \ndefendant's arraignment and identifying him as \"her attorney\"). \nEFTA00023532\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 309 Filed 07/01/21 Page 2 of 3 \nHonorable Alison J. Nathan \nJuly \n1, 2021 \nPage 2 \nMr. Markus has made multiple statements to the media in the past few months.2  On May \nII, 2021, the Government emailed the defendant's counsel of record in this case and expressed \nconcern about Mr. Markus's statements, citing Local Rule 23.1. Defense counsel did not respond. \nMost recently, on June 30, 2021, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed in the New York Daily \nNews.3  The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill Cosby and argued that this case should be \ndismissed in the wake of Mr. Cosby's release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein's \nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that \"[t]he trial court, just like the trial \ncourt and intermediate appellate court in Cosby's case, has agreed to let the government out of its \ndeal.\" The Op-Ed further claims that this case is \"extremely weak\" and asserts that \"[a] jury should \nreject those flimsy and stale charges.\" The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as \"Maxwell's \nappellate counsel.\" Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.4\nB. Relief Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.1 \nLocal Rule 23.1 generally prohibits extrajudicial statements of opinion that a  reasonable \nperson would expect to create \"a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with \na  fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\" SDNY Local Rule 23.1(a). \nThe Rule further provides, in relevant part, that statements of \"opinion as to the accused's guilt or \ninnocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case\" are among those that \n\"presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with \na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\" SDNY Local Rule 23.1(d)(7). \nThe Rule applies to all statements made by lawyers \"in connection with pending or imminent \ncriminal litigation with which they are associated.\" SDNY Local Rule 23.1(a). Furthermore, the \nRule provides that the Court \"may issue a special order governing such matters as extrajudicial \nstatements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial \nby an impartial jury ....\" SDNY Local Rule 23.1(h). \nMr. Markus is plainly governed by Local Rule 23.1, because he is not only \"associated\" \nwith this criminal case, but he is also counsel of record in the defendant's appeals in connection \nwith this matter. Mr. Markus's comments to the media—most egregiously, the Op-Ed—were \nclearly in violation of Local Rule 23.1. Not only did his statements directly comment on the merits \nof this case, but they did so in a manner designed to appeal directly to the pool of potential jurors \n2 See Ben Feuerherd, Feds Detail Ghislaine Maxwell's 'Enhanced Security Schedule' In Prison, N.Y.

Nathan \nJuly \n1, 2021 \nPage \n3 \nin this case: the Op-Ed was published in a local newspaper, and it contained an express overture \nto jurors, discussing the verdict defense counsel wishes jurors to reach in this case. What is more, \nthe Op-Ed falsely suggested to potential jurors that this prosecution is barred by a non-prosecution \nagreement—a legal contention this Court has considered and squarely rejected. \nThis Court has already entered an Order—at the request of the defendant—indicating the \nCourt's expectation that \"all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with \nthis Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1.\" (Dkt. No. 28). Mr. Markus's \ncontinued comments are in violation of that Order, are inappropriate, and are likely to interfere \nwith the Court's ability to conduct a fair trial with an impartial jury in this case. Accordingly, the \nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court issue an order pursuant to Local Rule 23.1(h) \ndirected specifically to Mr. Markus and instructing him to comply with Local Rule 23.1. \nRespectfully submitted, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  Is\nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern \nDistrict of New York \nTel: (212) 637-2225 \nCc: Christian Everdell, Esq.
