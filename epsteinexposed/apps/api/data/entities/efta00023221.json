Our team has reviewed your draft and is prepared to go forward with the call \nat 12:30pm today. \nBest, \nOn Nov 11, 2020, at 12:08 PM, Kathleen E. Cassidy \n< \nwrote: \nAll: \nWe want to give you a draft of our suggested changes (attached) before our conversation this afternoon. We \nrealize the time is short before our scheduled call, so if you do not have sufficient time to review it in \nadvance of our call, we are happy to push the time for our call back until after you have had a chance to \nreview it. \nWe have tried to work within the framework you provided. There are some allegations which we do not \nbelieve are accurate. Given the long passage of time, however, we understand that there might be different \nrecollections about what occurred. We have tried to set forth both views of what occurred. We understand \nthat you do not want a Fatico hearing and are willing to agree that we will not ask for a Fatico hearing to \nattempt to resolve the different recollections. \nWith respect to the specific allegations about being present during massages when girls were sexually \nassaulted, does not believe she was ever present during any of these incidents and believes that the \ngirls misremember the circumstances. We note that these events occurred a long time ago and were \nemotionally charged, a circumstance which can cause people to have faulty memories. \nIndeed, we think that some of the evidence seems to contradict the victim's claims that was present \nwhen they, as minors, were sexually molested by Epstein. \nSpecifically, based on allegations in a lawsuit, one of the victims referred to in the statement of facts states \nthat she was abused on Epstein's ranch when she was a minor and that was present. But flight logs \nreflect that the first time that the victim was on a flight to or from the ranch where she states the abuse \noccurred was in April 2003, after the victim was 18 years old. Moreover, the victim's attorney has also stated \nthat a photo of the victim and Epstein in which the victim is smiling, taken in December 2002, was taken \nbefore the victim knew that Epstein would sexually abuse her. This appears to contradict the victim's \nallegation that in the summer of 2002 she was flown to the ranch and abused by Epstein in the presence of \nTo be clear, we are not asserting that this victim is lying about Epstein abusing her. Our point is simply that \nthis occurred 18 years ago and that she appears to be confused about the timing of events and who was \npresent. \nAnother victim claims that that walked in on an incident where the victim was performing on \nEpstein in his New York townhouse. This victim has named as a defendant in her civil suit and has \nalleged that this incident occurred in 2005. During this time period, worked out of Maxwell's home \nand spent little time in Epstein's townhouse. Staff, including =, were never allowed to roam the halls or \ngo into private areas of Epstein's Manhattan home unless they were summoned there. never walked in \non someone when that person was giving Epstein and believes that this victim must be confusing \nher with someone else. \nEFTA00023223\n\ndoes not doubt that Epstein abused these women, as he did with almost all young women and girls \nhe came into contact with, but the available evidence does not support the assertion that was \npresent for or witnessed any sexual abuse of these victims while they were minors. Accordingly, we do not \nobject to allowing these women telling their stories but we cannot agree that the allegations in their stories \nconcerning are correct. \nLet us know what would work best for a call. \nThanks, \nKate \nKate Cassidy \nNecheles Cassidy LLP \nMobile \n<2020.10.11 Defense edited SOF.docx> \n<2019.11.20 Complaint v.
