Hardy \nSection Chief, \nRecord/Information \nDissemination \nSection \nRecords \nManagement Division \nEndosure(s) \nEFTA00024040\n\nFBI FACT SHEET \n• The primary functions of the FBI are national security and law enforcement. \n• The FBI does not \nkeep a file on every citizen of the United States. \n• The FBI was not established until 1908 and we have very few records prior to the 1920s. \n• FBI \nfiles generally contain reports of FBI investigations of a wide range of matters, including counterterrorism, \ncounter-intelligence, cyber crime, public corruption, civil rights, organized crime, white collar crime, major thefts, \nviolent crime, and applicants. \n• The FBI does not issue clearances or non-clearances for anyone other than its own personnel or persons \nhaving access to FBI facilities. Background investigations for security clearances are conducted by many \ndifferent Government agencies. Persons who received a clearance while in the military or employed with some \nother government agency should contact that entity. Most government agencies have websites which are \naccessible on the internet which have their contact information. \n• An identity history summary check or \"rap sheet\" is NOT the same as an \"FBI file.\" It is a listing of \ninformation taken from fingerprint cards and related documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, \nfederal employment, \nnaturalization or military service. The subject of a \"rap sheet\" may obtain a copy by \nsubmitting a written request to FBI CJIS Division —  Summary Request, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV \n26306. Along with a specific written request, the individual must submit a new full set of his/her fingerprints in \norder to locate the record, establish positive identification, and ensure that an individual's records are not \ndisseminated to an unauthorized person. The fingerprint submission must include the subject's name, date and \nplace of birth. There is a required fee of $18 for this service, which must be submitted by money order or \ncertified check made payable to the Treasury of the United States. A credit card payment option is also \navailable. Forms for this option and additional directions may be obtained by accessing the FBI Web site at \nwww.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. \n• The National Name Check Program (NNCP) conducts a search of the FBI's Universal Index (UNI) \nto identify \nany information contained in FBI records that may be associated with an individual and provides the results of that \nsearch to a requesting federal, state or local agency. Names are searched in a multitude of combinations and \nphonetic \nspellings to ensure all records are located. The NNCP also searches for both -main\" and \"cross \nreference\" files. A main file is an entry that carries the name corresponding to the subject of a file, while a cross \nreference is merely a mention of an individual contained in a file. The results from a search of this magnitude \ncan result in several \"hits\" and \"idents\" on an individual. In each instance where UNI has identified a name \nvariation or reference, information must be reviewed to determine if it is applicable to the individual in question. \n• The \nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for records and provides copies of FBI files \nresponsive to Freedom of Information or Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for information. RIDS provides \nresponsive documents to requesters seeking \"reasonably described information.\" For a FOIPA search, the \nsubject's name, event, activity, or business is searched to determine whether there is an associated investigative \nfile. This is called a \"main file search\" and differs from the NNCP search. \nFOR GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FBI, VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT \nwww.fbi.gov \n7/18/16 \nEFTA00024041\n\nEXPLANATION OF EXEMPTIONS \nSUBSECTIONS OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 552 \n(b)(I) (A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign \npolicy and (B) are in fact properly classified to such Executive order; \n(bX2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; \n(bX3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the \nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding \nor refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; \n(bX4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; \n(bX5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other titan an agency in litigation with \nthe agency; \n(bX6) personnel and medical \nfiles \nand similar \nfiles \nthe disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; \n(bX7) records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records \nor information ( A ) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.

Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find \nuseful. \nPart 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests \n5 U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the \nrequirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S. C. § 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses \nare limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA.

The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and \nforeign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests \nfor records about individuals (5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.0 § 3024(1)(1)j. The mere \nacknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) \nand/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3): 50 USC § \n3024(i)(1). \nThis is \na standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not \nexist. \nPart 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals \n(i) \nRequests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of \nany individual's name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption \n(b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) U.S.C. §§ \n552/552a (b)(7)(E), OM.

The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records \nwhich could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to \nFOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption ()(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (bX7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)). \nThis is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist. \nPart 3: General Information: \n(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by \nsearching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by \nsearching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, \nintelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its \ndual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel \nfunctions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters (\"FBIHQ\"), FBI \nField Offices, and FBI Legal Attache Offices (\"Legats\") worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) \nrecords. \n(ii) \nFBI Records \nFounded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, \nthe FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, \nsubject, or \nentity. \n(iii) \nRequests for Criminal History Records or \"Rap Sheets.\" The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division \nprovides Identity History Summary Checks —often referred to as a criminal history record or 'rap sheets: These \ncriminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative \"FBI file.\" An Identity History Summary Check \nis a listing of information taken from fingerprint \ncards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, \nfederal employment, naturalization, or military service.

Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the \nrequirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S. C. § 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses \nare limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA \ncan be found on the \nIbi.gov \nwebsite. \n(ii) National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and \nforeign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (bX1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests \nfor records about individuals [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.0 § 3024(i)(1)]. The mere \nacknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) \nand/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3); 50 USC § \n3024(i)(1). \nThis is \na standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not \nexist. \nPart 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for \nIndividuals \n(i) Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of \nany individual's name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ \n552/552a (b)(7)(E), (j)(2). This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or \ndo not exist. \n(ii) Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records \nwhich could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to \nFOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E). (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)). \nThis is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist. \nPart 3: General Information: \n(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by \nsearching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by \nsearching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, \nintelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its \ndual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel \nfunctions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters ('FBIHQ\"), FBI \nField Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices ('Legats') worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) \nrecords. \n(ii) FBI Records \nFounded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, \nthe FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, \nsubject, or entity. \n(iii) Requests for Criminal History Records or \"Rap Sheets.\" The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division \nprovides Identity History Summary Checks —often referred to as a criminal history record or \"rap sheets?
