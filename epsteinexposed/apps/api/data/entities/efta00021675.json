EPSTEIN was a \nmember \nand VISOSKI was the manager. Further, Plan D LLC was established in 2012 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nPer a request to the FAA dated August 07, 2017 from VISOSKI, they requested to change the tail number from N415LM to \nN212JE. \nIn January 2018 they changed the tail number to N212JE. VISOSKI provided phone number and e-mail: \nOn August 14, 2019 I was told that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and was in a hangar at the Cobb County airport \n(KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia. \nFlight plans indicated N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it \noperated from \nTeterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). \nPer a bill of sale dated December 22, 2020, Lawrence VISOSKI on behalf of Plan D LLC \"sold\" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC \nwho \"sold\" it the same day \nto N550GP LLC in Ontario, CA.

New York, NY 10022. The signature on the aircraft registration application is \nnot legible \nbut they listed their title as President. They changed the tail number to N908JE in April 2001. On the 2013 re-registration \napplication for N908JE, \nDarren K. INDYKE, Vice President signed as Vice President of JEGE Inc. \nThey were the registered owner of N908JE from 2001 until October 05, 2019 when the registration was cancelled. \nThe aircraft was on the Part 125 certificate of JEGE Inc. and the CEO was Jeffrey EPSTEIN, \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33406 Phone \nN9081E was certificated for passenger operations only (not cargo). \nN908JE has a business configuration with a kitchen and bedroom and has approximately 25 seats in the aircraft and they \naren't economy seats. \nIt was used for private business not charter flights. \nhttps://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/1237885/n908je-boeing-727-100 \nEFTA00021677\n\nN908JE might be in Brunswick, Georgia (BQK).
