Our event is held here every year, but is \nvery small in comparison to many other meetings and conventions that are held here on a non-regular basis. If \nthere's a possibility that they could have attended another event that was in the city, you may want to contact the \nNew Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau (www.neworleanscvb.com) to see what other events may have \noccurred during that time. I  do not know how far their records go back, but having worked in hotels in the city, I \nknow that they publish lists to its members of meetings taking place in the city. \nSony we couldn't be of more help. \nAdele \nOn Apr 14, 2011, at 3:00 PM, \nJo \nwrote: \nEFTA00019165\n\nGood afternoon, \nAfter calling 1-800-648-8411 for general conference information, the young lady there suggested that I  email you as the \nconference coordinator. \nI  am a special agent with the Miami Division/West Palm Beach Office of the FBI. The phone number below, 561-833-7517, \nis the main office number in West Palm Beach, and Miami's office number is 305-944-9101. (The switchboard operators at \neither number can verify my identity.) \nI  am trying to locate the financial and /or investment conference that two individuals attended in New Orleans between \napproximately 1998-2000 and what hotels your conference would have used during those time periods. I  believe your \nconference may be the one I  am looking for. \nI  am trying to determine if the following two individuals attended the New Orleans Investment Conference between 1998-\n2000; \n1. Jeffrey Epstein \n2. \nAny information or assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you, \nSA \nFBI Miami Division \n505 Flagler Dr. Ste. 500 \nWest Palm Beach, FL B401 \n(561) \n833.7517 \n(561) 650-6951 fax \nAdele A.
