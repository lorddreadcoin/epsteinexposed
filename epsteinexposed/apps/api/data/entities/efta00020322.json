Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (MN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential \nmaterials, scenes \nDate: Mon, 22 Mar 2021 21:18:42 +0000 \nInline-Images: image00 Ljpg \nAll, \nWe have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the \ncase and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. \nFirst, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices \nwhich are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the \nphysical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. \nSecond, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her \nown defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by \nwhich she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. \nIn order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: \nPhysical Evidence \n•  All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street \nand made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to \naccommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. \no  We do not need the \"bulky\" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence \npieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and \nphotograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. \no  From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes \nwith cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two \"cash\" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. \no  If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are \nand where they are. \n•  We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission \nfrom Judge Nathan to do so. \n•  Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can \nbring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats \nof each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by \nMarch 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. \n•  The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem \"highly confidential.\" You can identify any \"highly \nconfidential\" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If \nwe need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, \nwe will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence \nreview proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item \nbasis. \n•  The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence \nview the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek \nEFTA00020322\n\nleave of the Court in advance. \n•  We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl \nStreet but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a \nseparate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the \ngovernment. \n•  Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described \nbelow) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the \ndiscovery deadlines last fall and why. \nHighly Confidential \nElectronic Evidence \n•  Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 \"highly confidential\" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our \nunderstanding that you previously provided all \"highly confidential\" images to our client —  and to defense counsel —\nfor review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were \nlocated and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. \n•  During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a \ndefense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked \"highly \nconfidential\". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, \npreviously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). \nPlease let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. \nThank you. \nLaura A.

Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes \nAll, \nAttached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding \ndiscovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. \nIn response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: \nRegarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: \n•  There are three categories of these images: \no  Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not \nbeen previously provided to you) \no  Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have \npreviously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) \no  Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of \nEpstein (which have not been previously provided to you) \n•  The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, \nand the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. \nEFTA00020323\n\no  All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must \nbe viewed using Cellebrite. \no  The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple \ndevices. \no  The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each \nimage. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all \nother images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. \no  The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder \nto indicate which device each image was seized from. \n•  Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and \nthere is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able \nto provide a  single laptop for review of these images. \nRegarding the physical evidence: \n•  Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items \nassociated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the \nFBI New York office's current investigation. \n•  The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two \nitems (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 \nFederal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that \nyou will have all evidence in one place. \n•  The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the \nfollowing conditions: \no  The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and \nplace them in a location where a large group of people can view them. \no  The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. \no  At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. \no  The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. \nTo ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend \nto be physically present for this review. \no  Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team \nmay bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If \nthe defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who \nare present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the \npresence of nudity. \no  Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. \n•  To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, \nthe FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large \nitems, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed \nHighly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if \nnecessary. \n•  The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a \nsingle location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media \nthat does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI \nanticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in \ndowntown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. \no  To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's \nresidences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For \nyour awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on \nall of those discs. \nPlease let me know how you wish to proceed. \nBest, \nEFTA00020324\n\nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nI  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 15, 2021 6:00 PM \nTo: 'Laura Menninger' \n<Imenninger@hmflaw.com>.\n(USANYS)\nCc: Jeff Pagliuca \n<jpagliuca@hmflaw.com>•\n Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>.
