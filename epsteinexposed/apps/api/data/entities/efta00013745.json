    "text": "\n\nVIA ELECTRONIC MAIL \nLilly Ann Sanchez, Esq. \nFowler White Burnett \n1395 Brickell Ave Fl 14 \nMiami Florida 33131-3300 \nRe: \nJeffrey Epstein \nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of Florida \nOctober \n9, 2007 \nDear Lilly: \nThank you for your letter to First Assistantaregarding the selection of an attorney to \nrepresent the victims identified in the investigation of Mr. Epstein. While I appreciate your client's \ninterest in a resolution of the victim's claims without the filing of lawsuits, I do not believe that your \nproposal falls within the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement signed by your client and the \nUnited States. \nI would recommend the following. The U.S. Attorney's Office would ask Judge Davis to \nassist in the selection of one or more attorneys to represent the identified victims. If Judge Davis \nis willing to perform that limited service pro bono, Mr. Epstein will not need to pay for that service. \nThe United States would provide Judge Davis with a  list of criteria for the selection of the \nattomey(s). \nThe selected attorney(s) would represent the victim(s) on a contingency fee basis, pursuant \nto a fee agreement reached between the victim(s) and the attomey(s). If he deems it appropriate, \nJudge Davis can propose the terms of that agreement, subject to acceptance by the victim. The \nlawyer(s) can interview each potential client to determine how they want to proceed —  including \nwhether she wants to use the attorney selected by Judge Davis or if she wants to choose her own \nattorney. Judge Davis can advise the selected attorney(s) of Mr. Epstein's desire to settle the cases \nout of court using Judge Davis as the mediator/special master, which the attorneys can report to their \nclients. If any one or more of the victims, in consultation with their independent counsel, wants to \nmediate the case, and agrees that Judge Davis should serve as the mediator/special master, they can \nproceed accordingly. At that point, Mr. Epstein's payment of Judge Davis's fees would be more \nappropriate. \nEFTA00013745\n\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, \nESQ. \nOCTOBER 9, 2007 \nPAGE 2 \nI am out of the District, so I am not available to meet with you this week. I am available for \na telephone conference tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. or Thursday at 5:00 p.m., if you would like to discuss \nthis in more detail. I also have not heard any more from Jay Lefkowitz or Guy Lewis, so please let \nme know whether I need to contact them directly or if you will share this information with them. \nThank you for your assistance. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited States Attorne \nBy: \ncc: \nEFTA00013746",
