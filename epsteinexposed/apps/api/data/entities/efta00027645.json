I expect he'll testify on 11/29, \nbut he could possible bleed over into 11/30 if we get tied up in jury selection issues, so I'd like to schedule his flight out of \nNY for the evening of 11/30. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you, as always, for your help. \nEFTA00027645",
