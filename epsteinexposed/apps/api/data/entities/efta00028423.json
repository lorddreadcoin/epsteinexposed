Please advise if the Govt intends to \nmark all 302s as \"confidential\" or just the identifying info (names, addresses, etc). \nPar 12 - defense should be allowed to retain discovery through the filing date of a 2255 \nReid, Mike may have additional questions, points. \nAvailable after 1 to discuss. \nThanks \nMarty \nMartin G.
