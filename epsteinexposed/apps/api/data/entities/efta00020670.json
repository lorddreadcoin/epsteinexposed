Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(AJN) \nDate: Mon, 27 Jul 2020 22:26:28 +0000 \nAttachments: GM,_protective_order,_clean_version.docx \nAttached is a Word version of the proposed protective order we submitted to the Court. In regards to your prior email, it \nsounds like it would be a more productive discussion after you have had the chance to review the redline of our proposed \norder. So we propose a call at 9:30am tomorrow morning. Let us know if that works for you and I will circulate a dial-in. \nThanks, \nFrom:  \nSent: Monda Jul 27 2020 5:43 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nMR \nWe also request that the defense provide the Government with a Word version of its proposed protective order \nsubmitted to the Court earlier today. We are not able to run a redline using the filed version. \nRegards, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 27, 2020 16:43 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nPursuant to the Court's Order of this afternoon, we write to schedule a telephonic meet and confer on issues relating to a \nprotective order in the above-captioned case. Please let us know what time you are available today between 5:00 p.m. \nand 8:00 p.m., or tomorrow between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. In particular, it would be helpful to get the defendant's \ncurrent position on the following: \n- Whether you are aware of any case in any federal district in which a protective order was entered in a criminal \ncase that prevented the Government from showing its own documents to prospective witnesses or their counsel \nwithout requiring restrictions upon those witnesses and their counsel; \nEFTA00020670\n\nWhether you are able to describe any expected reason why it would be necessary or useful for the defendant to \nreference by name — rather than by pseudonym or other anonymized identifier — any victim in a public statement \nor publicly-docketed filing (and rather than by sealed filing, if such named identification is necessary), such that \nthe Government may consider whether it can formulate language to address any such concerns, without \nconceding any right of the defendant to name any individual who has self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein \nor Ghislaine Maxwell at any time; and \nWhether the defense is willing to itself propose any language to address the Government's concerns in relation \nto the issue described immediately above, regarding the defendant's desire to be able to reference by name any \nvictim in a public statement or publicly-docketed filing, without conceding that any such right exists. \nAdditionally, also relating to the production of discovery, please mail, or otherwise have delivered, a 1 terabyte hard drive \nfor purposes of the Government's discovery production. While we are in the process of determining the size of an initial \nproduction, and the size may total substantially less than 1 terabyte, that will ensure our ability to make a robust initial \nproduction and should be suitable for subsequent productions as well. That can be sent to my attention at our Office. \nRegards, \n= \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00020671",
