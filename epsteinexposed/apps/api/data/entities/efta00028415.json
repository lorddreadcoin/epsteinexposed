Just on the risk assessment, is there any way at all for them to pull that? We expect \nwe may get questions on it at the bail hearing on Monday, so totally understand it's with the vendor but if it's all possible \nto pull that file so we can have a copy that would be great — just wanted to check. \nthanks very much again, \nIM• \nFrom: • \nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2019 08:25 \nTo: \nCc: \n<Me \nSubject: Re: Epstein case/NYPD Sex Offender Monitoring Unit \n> \nThe discovery of the photographs will not have any effect on, nor will it alter, the status of his sex offender \nregistration. We have conferred with the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) in Albany in order to \nobtain his case file which would include the risk assessment. They are in the middle of a multi-year project to \ndigitally scan all of their dots and the Epstein file is with the vendor. We should have it within 10 days. \nLt.

M, \nThanks very much for being in touch, and I'm in receipt of your email — should Mr. Epstein be granted bail and released, I \nwill certainly advise his attorneys that he or they must contact you immediately to arrange for the processes required in \nEFTA00028415\n\nNew York State. I'm also copying my colleagues on the case, prosecutors and S so they're \naware of the issue as well. \nSeparately, at the bail hearing yesterday the judge asked if there is any effect from the discovery of nude and partially-\nnude photographs of women and girls who appear to be young, including possibly under 18 years of age, discovered \nduring a search on Saturday in his New York residence. Do you know if there is any impact of that with respect to his New \nYork registration and/or offender status? Or if there's another person I should check with about that? I'm happy to give \nanyone a call. \nSimilarly, I believe that there may have been a 2011 state risk assessment in connection with Epstein—is it possible to \nobtain a copy of that? \nthanks very much, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, July 09, 2019 12:22 \nTo: \nSubject: Epstein case/NYPD Sex Offender Monitoring Unit \nMr. \nThank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. \nEpstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish \nresidence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a \nnew photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at \nmy office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or \nconcerns in this matter. \nLt \nNew York City Police Department \nSpecial Victims Division \nCommanding Officer \nSex Offender Monitoring Unit \nRoom 1414 \n100 Centre Street , N.Y, N.Y. \nEFTA00028416",
