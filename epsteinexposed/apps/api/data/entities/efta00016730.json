Hopefully \n—+ \nanother para \nor intern will confirm the quotes, etc., for the whole document, but I think one of us should lay eyes on the key cases in \neach section. If you have bandwidth, would you mind doing either section I or sections II and III? \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, October 18, 2021 12:08 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: \n<)'; \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Monday \nAmazing! Thank you! \nI've attached a draft for citechecking. We'll probably make some small tweaks before finalizing the table of contents and \nauthorities. This is pretty long, so if there's another paralegal who can help pitch in, feel free to rope them in too. I'll see \nif I can find an intern who can help. \nThanks! \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Sunday, October 17, 2021 8:55 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Monday \n<S; \n(USANYS) \nHi \nFor sure, I'll definitely have time to tackle this tomorrow.
