These charges, which were brought in November 2019, stem from the \ncorrectional officers' falsification of institutional count and round forms on the night that Jeffrey Epstein \ncommitted suicide. The deferred prosecution agreements will require, among other things, the defendants to \ncooperate with a pending Office of Inspector General investigation by providing truthful information about the \nevents in question; an admission of guilt from both defendants as to the conduct set forth in the indictment; \nand for both defendants to complete 100 hours of community service, preferably in an area related to the \ncriminal justice system. The USAO-SDNY plans to file a public letter by Friday, May 21 notifying the Court of the \ndefendants' acceptance of the deferred prosecution agreements and seeking a hearing date; the USAO-SDNY \nanticipates that the deferred prosecution agreements will be entered by the Court by the following Friday, May \n28. \nDESCRIPTION: \nOn November 14, 2019, USAO-SDNY obtained an indictment against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas which \ncharged them with multiple counts of making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and conspiring \nto (i) make false statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful function of the MCC, in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. § 371. As alleged in the Indictment, on August 9 and 10, 2019, the defendants falsely indicated on \nBureau of Prison forms that they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. On August 10, 2019, \ninmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while housed in the Special Housing Unit at the MCC. After \ndiscovering Epstein's body, the defendants admitted to their supervisor that they had failed to conduct at least \nsome of the required counts and rounds. The falsification of records occurred prior to their discovery of \nEpstein's body. \nEFTA00013389\n\nThe USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to both defendants. The USAO-SDNY has \ndetermined that deferring the defendants' prosecution is an outcome consistent with the interests of justice, \nthe mitigating personal circumstances of the defendants, and the Department's practice in the overwhelming \nmajority of other cases in which correctional officers have been investigated or charged with falsifying count or \nround forms. As a condition of the defendants' agreement, they will be required to admit their guilt and \ncooperate by providing truthful information with the Office of Inspector General, which is preparing a report \non, among other things, their conduct on the night in question, the circumstances in which they discovered \nEpstein's body after his suicide, and the institutional failures that led to Epstein's death at the MCC The \nagreement does not preclude any administrative action or termination by the Bureau of Prisons. The \ndefendants will also be subject to pretrial supervision for six months, must refrain from committing any crimes, \nand will be required to complete 100 hours of community service. This outcome is supported by the \ninvestigative agencies, the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, as well as the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, and has been approved by Pretrial Services. The USAO-SDNY plans to send a public letter by \nMay 21, 2021 to notify the Court that the Government has offered, and the defendants have accepted, deferred \nprosecution agreements, and in order to request a hearing date, which the Government expects to be \nscheduled for the following week, by May 28. \nReport ID: 2021-05-66021 \nFor Official Use Only \n(FOUO): \nThe term used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sensitive \nnature, not otherwise categorized by statute or regulation, the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely \nimpact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential \nto the national interest.
