However, there seem to be some technical issues, \nas they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the IA Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a \"codec problem,\" meaning there was probably some sort of \nuser error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever \nsent us the media. With this one \nexemption, \nthe rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. \nI'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need further assistance. \nFile Type of Media Length (hr, min, sec) Description \n31E-MM-1.08062-1A Vol. 3 \n(located in 61-1A Sec. 03, FDPS pg. 250 \non T-drivel \nAudio 3:08:54 \n48 Grand Jury Testimony audio files dated 7/19/2006 (media \nreceived from the PEI State Attorney's Office). \n31E-MM-108062-1A43 \nin 1A Sec.

As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we \nwere hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents \nthat looked like the attached file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If  not, no worries at all, we have them from \nthe primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent. \nThanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, February 13, 2019 9:53 AM \nTo: \nCc: a e'; USANTS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \nH \n(FBI) \n•S: \nWanted to \nquickly \ncheck in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week -  I  think you were able to transmit the scanned records tos but I'm \nnot sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we last spoke, or if  you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for \nsure that all the materials you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was included). \nAnother person on our team, S who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via phone her number is \nlet us know if anything would be helpful on our end. \nthanks again! \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 2019 17:19 \nTo: \nCc: =IM \nUSANTS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \n(NY) (FBI) \nea \nand please \nEFTA00018254\n\nFollowing up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact info -  I'm reachable at this email address or by \nphone at (off ice) or (cell).
