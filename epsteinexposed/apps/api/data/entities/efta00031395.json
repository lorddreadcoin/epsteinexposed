I believe also sent out notifications, and hopefully \nshe can tell us how many she sent. \nFor the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing \nand either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing \nbut had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were \nnot referenced on the record. \nI don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but \nwas unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, October 30, 2019 1:06 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: FW: Epstein Victim Impact Statements \nImportance: High \n(USANYS) \nAre we able to answer these questions for ODAG quickly? I am sure we can answer the second, and maybe the first — not \nsure about the third. \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, October 30, 2019 12:53 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS). \nCc: \n(ODAG) \nSubject: Epstein Victim Impact Statements \nImportance: High \nThe Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of \ntheir issues is the \nDistrict Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to \"have their day in court.\" The \nCourt's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has \nalleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing \nbecause they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. \nEFTA00031395\n\nCan your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about \nmaking a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim \nimpact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but \nwere unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? \nPlease provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but \nthe Department's response to the mandamus petition is due tomorrow \nI really \nappreciate your assistance. \nNational Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention & Interdiction \nOffice of \nthe De ut Attorney General \nEFTA00031396",
