She said there was interest from the AG's \nOffice in the release and had some questions. We talked through things, and she said she'd carry the info back. She said \nshe or someone else from DC might follow up. \nThanks, \nSubject: Epstein FOIA \nMorning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. \nShe asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process \nquestions, and I anticipate declining to comment anyway. \nDo we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a  hard time hearing during the call, but my \nimpression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks. \nSpokesman \nUnited States Department of Justice \nU.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of New York \nEFTA00029454",
