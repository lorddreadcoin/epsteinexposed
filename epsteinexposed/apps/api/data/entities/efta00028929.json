(June 16, 2016) \niv \nEFTA00028933\n\nGhislaine Maxwell submits this reply in support of her Motion to suppress all evidence \nthe government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and \nto dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. \nIntroduction and Summary of the Argument \nIf the government meant to reassure this Court that nothing improper happened, its \nResponse was anything but \nreassuring. \nThe government now confesses that it had significant and substantial contact with \nattorneys in 2016—while the defamation suit against Maxwell was \non-going—as part of an effort to instigate a criminal prosecution of Maxwell for allegedly \ntrafficking and others and then lying under oath. Doubling down on an increasingly \nfarfetched story, however, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it \nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief \nJudge \nof the Southern District of New York. \nContrary to the government's portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor \nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney's Office, in an a parte proceeding, \naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of \nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell. \nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would \nnever have obtained the 90,000 pages of material it now possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention \ninjustice, to allow the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government \ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge. \n\"In a situation like this, the judiciary ... may exercise its supervisory power to make it \nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government's unwillingness to own up to it was \nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.\" \n1 \nEFTA00028934\n\nWang v. Reno, 81 F.3d 808, 821 (9th Cir. 1996). For the reasons given below, the exercise of this \nCourt's supervisory authority is called for here. \nI. The Facts \nPressed into some minimal measure of candor, the government now admits the following \nfacts are \ntrue: \n• \nOn February 29, 2016, AUSA M, the Human Trafficking Coordinator and \nProject Safe Childhood Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, Ex. J, p 1, met with Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller, Stan \nPottinger, and Brad Edwards, who represented M, Ex. K, p  I. \n• The meeting concerned allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking by \nJeffrey Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J, pp 1-3. \n• At the meeting, attorneys told AUSA the following: \no That Maxwell was Epstein's \"head recruiter\" of underage victims. Id. at 2. \no \nThat was underage when she was brought to New York \"for training \nby Maxwell and Epstein [in] how to service men.\" Id. at 3. \no \nThat had a pending civil lawsuit against Maxwell for defamation \nalleging that Maxwell had recruited to be trafficked and abused by \nEpstein. Id. at 4, 7. \no That Maxwell was asserting truth as a defense to defamation claim. \nId. at 4, 7. \no That Maxwell had photos of naked underage girls on her computer. Id. at 6.1\n' No such photos were found on or produced from any computers associated with Maxwell. \n2 \nEFTA00028935\n\no That Maxwell and Epstein-friend \"took sexually explicit \nphotos of [M] regularly.\"2 Id. \no That, as a birthday present, Maxwell gave Epstein a sexually explicit photo of \ntaken when was sixteen.3 Id. \no That Epstein hung the photo on one of his walls.4 Id. \no \nThat has a note in Maxwell's handwriting with the name of another \nvictim. Id. at 8.5\no \nThat was \"live in\" sex slave from 2000-2002.6  Id. at 3. \no That there were other victims of Epstein and Maxwell, including \nM, id. at 7, who is apparently Accuser-I in this case, and another woman \nwhose description matches id. at 9, who is apparently \nAccuser-3. \no That Accuser-I was \"highly credible.\" Id. at 7. \no That Epstein and Maxwell used \"the same MO with\" Accuser-3 that they used \nwith . Id. at 7, 9. \no \nAnd that \"wants [a] prosecution.\" Id. at 7. \n2  Maxwell denies ever taking any photos of M, and we have seen no sexually explicit photo \nof \nin any of the civil or criminal document productions. \n3  Not only did Maxwell not meet until was seventeen years old, Maxwell never \nprovided any such photo to Epstein, nor, to our knowledge, has any such photo ever been produced, in the \ncivil or criminal cases. \nAgain, we have not seen any such photo produced in any discovery, either in the civil or \ncriminal cases. \nWe are aware of no note in Maxwell's handwriting being produced in the action, or the \ncriminal discovery. \n6 \nwas in fact living with her fiancé at the time and held multiple other jobs, as later \nconfirmed through depositions and documents in the action. \n3 \nEFTA00028936\n\n• The attorneys promised to send \nAUSA \nsupport their request for a prosecution. Id. at 8. \n• Calling the meeting \"intriguing,\" AUSA \n\"affidavits and depositions\" to \nemailed the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision three days later and proposed to \"talk over\" the facts with him. Ex. M, pp 1-\n2. He agreed. Id. at I. \n• In the days and weeks after the February 29 meeting, there were several emails \nbetween \nattorneys and AUSA Exs. L & N. \n• There was also at least one phone call. Ex. K, at 4. \n• attorneys provided AUSA with documents as promised. Id. at 2; see \nalso Ex. L, p 2. \nMost importantly, the government now admits that AUSA III  the prosecutor in \ncharge of the case who appeared before Chief Judge McMahon on April 9, 2019, knew all of this \nand still denied that Boies Schiller had any role in fomenting the investigation and claimed that \nthere had been no contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before November 2018, when \nhe claimed the investigation first began. \nNone of these statements by AUSA to Judge McMahon were true. \nAs \ndescribed above, \nattorneys pressed the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York to investigate and prosecute Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J. \nThen, two months after the meeting with AUSA attorneys told Judge \nSweet—who was presiding over defamation against Maxwell—that there was an \n4 \nEFTA00028937\n\n\"ongoing criminal investigation\" into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate \ndocuments, invoking the \"law enforcement privilege.\" Ex. P.7\nIn late November 2018 and early December 2018-just two months before AUSA \nfiled the ex parte request before Judge McMahon seeking modification of the civil \nProtective Order entered by Judge \nSweet—AUSA \nshared with AUSA as \nwell as one other member of the trial team and the heads of the Public Corruption Unit, \neverything she learned from her contacts with attorneys. Ex. N. \nAUSA \ngave \nAUSA \nand his colleagues: (1) nine pages of detailed, \nhand-written notes from the February 29 meeting; (2) the emails she received from \nattorneys; and (3) all the documents provided to her by attorneys. Id. Some of what she \ngave \nAUSA \nincluded material Boies Schiller attorneys designated a short time later \nas \"confidential\" under Judge Sweet's Protective Order, including flight records and Palm Beach \nPolice Department Records. \nAUSA \ntook an active role in gathering these materials from AUSA \nCopying \nAUSA \nAUSA \nhad emailed AUSA on December 5, 2018, \nto obtain all the records of the February 29 meeting with attorneys. Id. at 1. In that \nemail, \nAUSA \nalso asked \nAUSA \nwhether, after February 29, she met \"again \nwith [Peter Skinner] or anyone \nelse.\" Id. \n7  Two other aspects to the privilege log are notable: (a) In the litigation, Boies Schiller \ndid not produce its emails with the U.S. Attorney's Office to Maxwell, despite the fact that they were \ndirectly responsive to a Request for Production of Documents Maxwell served just a couple of weeks \nafter those emails were sent; and (b) Peter Skinner, the Boies Schiller attorney at the AUSA \nmeeting who also sent emails to AUSA after the meeting, Ex. L, is not even listed on the \nprivilege log, though the log purports to reflect all email communications about the \"ongoing criminal \ninvestigation\" that Boies Schiller had tried to initiate just a couple of weeks earlier. \n5 \nEFTA00028938\n\nBarely twelve hours later, when AUSA hadn't responded, \nAUSA \ntook it upon himself to follow up, emailing AUSA \"Just quickly following up on this — \nwe're trying to get a complete handle on the landscape —  thanks!\" Id. \nAUSA \nresponded one hour later: \"Just went through my files and found a folder \nw/ the notes I took and the documents they brought me.\" Id. She turned everything over to \nAUSA \nand other prosecutors in the office, including one other prosecutor on this trial \nteam. Id. \nAUSA \ndid not answer AUSA original question: \"[D]id [she] meet \nagain with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else\" after the February 29, 2016 meeting with \nattorneys. Id. But AUSA certainly did not deny a second meeting or a subsequent phone \ncall occurred. Id. \nBy the end of the day on December 6, 2018, AUSA had in his \npossession \neverything and her attorneys provided to AUSA as \nwell as AUSA \nextensive hand-written notes. He also had access to AUSA herself for any follow up \nquestions. By the end of the day, AUSA had a \"complete handle on the landscape,\" \njust as he asked for a couple hours earlier. \nWhen \nAUSA \nappeared before Judge McMahon barely four months later, \nhowever, he told her none of this, unequivocally and falsely disavowing any role by Boies \nSchiller in fomenting the investigation and denying any contacts between Boies Schiller and his \noffice before November 2018. Even though AUSA had a \"complete handle on the \nlandscape,\" he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon. \nII. The Government's Response to Maxwell's Motion. \nConfronted with evidence of AUSA misrepresentations to Judge McMahon, \nthe government has filed a Response reluctantly admitting that the U.S. Attorney's Office had \nsustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2016. Even so, the government tries its best to minimize \n6 \nEFTA00028939\n\nthe significance of those interactions and of AUSA misrepresentations to an Article \nIII federal judge. This Court should not permit the government to whitewash its conduct. \nThe discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the \ngovernment now offers of its conduct. And if that weren't enough, the government's defense \nfails on its own terms, because if this Court were to assume its truth (an assumption the \ngovernment has not earned), AUSA statements to Judge McMahon would still have \nbeen demonstratively and materially false. \nA. The Government's Defenses Are Not Credible. \nDiscovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the \ngovernment now offers of its conduct. \n• Defense 1: The February 29, 2016 meeting was only about Epstein. \nAUSA \ncontemporaneous hand-written notes entirely undermine the \ngovernment's claim that the February 29, 2016 meeting was about Epstein only and had nothing \nto do with Maxwell. Resp. at 89 & n.39. \nSee Ex. J. AUSA \nnotes refer to Maxwell as \nEpstein's \"head recruiter\" of underage girls; they document allegations that Maxwell \"regularly\" \ntook sexually explicit photos of and other underage girls, which she kept on her \ncomputer; they allege that Maxwell gave one such photo to Epstein as a birthday present, which \nhe hung on his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought to New York \nto personally \"train[] [her] . . . [in] how to service men;\" and they assert that Maxwell used the \n\"same MO\" to recruit other girls to the sex trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA \nnotes belie any notion that attorneys—who at that very moment were suing Maxwell \n7 \nEFTA00028940\n\nfor defamation for denying she had trafficked and abused \nwere \nfocused only on Epstein \nand not on Maxwell. \nDespite \nAUSA \ncontemporaneous notes showing that the meeting very much \nconcerned Maxwell, the government now claims that \"the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not \nMaxwell,\" and that the discussion included only \"passing references to Maxwell.\" Resp. at 89 \nn.39. The government bases this argument exclusively on a phone call prosecutors conducted \nwith \nAUSA \non February 11, 2021, five years after the February 29 meeting actually took \nplace. Ex. K. This Court should reject the government's revisionist history. \nThe best evidence of what happened on February 29, 2016—at least the best evidence the \ngovernment has produced so far—is AUSA contemporaneous notes.8 Ex. J.; Abdel! v. \nCity of New York, No. 05 CIV. 8453 KMK JCF, 2006 WL 2664313, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, \n2006) (denying motion to quash third-party subpoena because \"contemporaneous statements of \nwitnesses constitute best evidence\"). Although the government attached these notes to its \nResponse, Resp. Ex. 5, the government does not rely on them as part of its argument, choosing \ninstead to rely on AUSA 2021 recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62-66, 89 & \nn.39, 92 \n(citing Ex. 4). \ns   It appears the government does not actually want to know anything beyond what AUSA \nremembers (or doesn't remember) of 2016. All the government did in response to Maxwell's Motion was \ntelephone AUSA The government apparently: (1) did not search its system for any and all emails \nfrom, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawlpa Pottinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and \n(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA such as the other attendees of the meeting \n(Pottinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA talked to about her \ncontacts with attorneys. \nMost conspicuous, of course, is the government's failure to interview AUSA or secure \nan affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell's Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary \nhearing can address these issues. \n8 \nEFTA00028941\n\nBut in her 2021 interview, \nAUSA \nmostly disclaimed a memory of what happened \nin 2016. Ex. K. The phrases \"does not recall,\" \"does not remember,\" or some similar expression \nof lack of memory appear at least thirty-two times in the notes of the government's 2021 call \nwith \nAUSA \nId. \nMany of AUSA disclaimers, however, are simply not credible. For example, \nAUSA \nclaimed not to \"have an independent memory of the v. Maxwell \n[defamation] lawsuit being mentioned\" during the meeting, id. at I, even though her notes are \nreplete with references to the lawsuit, Ex. J. After reviewing her notes, AUSA denied \nthat they refreshed her memory. Ex. K, p  I. \nAUSA \nsimilarly denied remembering whether attorneys ever provided \nher with documents, id. at 6, despite the email from Peter Skinner just hours after the February \n29 meeting providing AUSA with numerous documents, Ex. L, p 1-2, and despite the \nfact that AUSA in 2018 personally delivered those documents to AUSA \nAUSA \nand one member of the prosecution team in this case, Ex. N, p 1  (12/6/2018 \nEmail to \nAUSA \n\"Just went through my files and found a folder w/ the notes I took \nand the documents they brought me. Want to come by?\"). \nWhen \nAUSA \ndid claim to remember what transpired, her memory was often \ninconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence. Take just one example. \"To [her] knowledge,\" \nAUSA \nsaid, she did \"not receive[] any discovery materials from any civil case.\" Ex. K, p \n6. That is not correct. The government admits that AUSA received from \nattorneys, and turned over to AUSA and others in the office, including flight records \nand Palm Beach Police Department Records. Resp. at 66 & n.2. Both of these \ndocuments were \nproduced in discovery in the civil case. \n9 \nEFTA00028942\n\nFrom any perspective, therefore, AUSA 2021 version of events is not \nworthy of \ncredence, nor is the government's Response to Maxwell's Motion, which adopts AUSA \nversion of events (to the extent she claims to remember them) while ignoring the \ncontemporaneous evidence of what actually happened. The record is surpassingly clear: In \nFebruary 2016 and the weeks and months after, attorneys \"pitched\" a \nprosecution of \nMaxwell and Epstein.' \n• Defense 2: The government was not asked to consider a perjury charge \nagainst Maxwell. \nNoting that the February 29, 2016 meeting occurred before Maxwell's two depositions \n(April and July 2016), the government insists that attorneys did not ask (indeed could \nnot have asked) the government to consider charging Maxwell with perjury. Resp. at 63. Again, \nthe documentary evidence belies this claim. \nFirst, \nAUSA \ncontemporaneous notes say that a wants prosecution.\" Ex. \nJ, p \n7. AUSA knew what attorneys were after, which is why she emailed the \nChief of the Criminal Division just days after the meeting to discuss the \"intriguing\" case, Ex. \nM. \nSecond, in the 2021 interview with prosecutors, AUSA did not deny that \nattorneys asked her to consider a perjury prosecution. Ex. K, p 5. Instead, AUSA \nsaid that she \"does not remember one way or the other if any of the attorneys referenced \nthe possibility of perjury.\" Id. \n9 There are other indications as well that attorneys pressed AUSA to investigate \nMaxwell. For example, while AUSA notes say \"is wanting to cooperate,\" Ex. \nJ, p 2, they say nothing of the sort about Maxwell, instead describing her as Epstein's \"head recruiter,\" id. \nSee also Ex. O. \nI0 \nEFTA00028943\n\nThird, in the same interview, AUSA admitted that she contemplated a perjury \nprosecution, and she \"recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have ... challenges.\" \nEx. K, p 5. Left unexplained by the government in its Response to Maxwell's Motion is why \nAUSA \nwould have contemplated a perjury prosecution if attorneys had not \nproposed \none. \nThere are two possible explanations. Either (1) attorneys knew in February \n2016 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with \nAUSA \nat the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA \nand attorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed. \nEither way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2016, and the \nResponse's insistence otherwise is not credible. \n• Defense 3: Maxwell's argument relies on nothing but the Daily News \narticle. \nThe government says that Maxwell's argument \"is premised solely on her use of selective \nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous \nsources and hearsay.\" Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its own \nterms. \nWhen Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government's emails and \nAUSA \ncontemporaneous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v. \nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (1963). The government did not disclose these materials until \nMaxwell challenged the government's candor and conduct before Judge McMahon. One \nwonders whether the government would have provided them to Maxwell had she not filed this \nMotion. \n11 \nEFTA00028944\n\nThe government's claim also fails on its own terms. The article is not meaningfully \nanonymous.10 Among others, the article quotes David Boies, who said: \nWe were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. \nSome of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's \nbeen developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive \nsex trafficking ring going on. \nThe article also quotes Brad Edwards, who describes in his self-published memoir the various \ncontacts attorneys had with the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2016. \nFinally, as detailed above, \nAUSA \ncontemporaneous notes confirm most of \nthe \narticle's substance.\" Ex. J. \n• Defense 4: There was only one meeting. \nThe government denies there was a second meeting between the U.S. Attorney's Office \nand attorneys. Resp. at 92. This denial, though, is based solely on AUSA \nfoggy memory and in the absence of any credible investigation. Contrary to the government's \nclaim, the evidence strongly suggests there was a second meeting or some further contact \nbetween them. At the very least, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing to find the truth. \n10 Stephen Rex Manhattan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and \nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2016, New York Daily News (Oct. 13, 2020), \nhttps://www.nydailynews.cominew-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-20201013-\njinzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-stoiy.html.\nTo the extent the article relies on unnamed sources, there is no indication those sources are \nanonymous in the sense that the author is unaware of their identity. In the 2021 call, the government \napparently did not ask AUSA whether she was one of the unnamed sources. See Ex. K. \n11 The government also says the article is hearsay. Resp. at 89. This is an odd claim for the \ngovernment to make while asking this Court to credit double hearsay: someone's notes of statements \nmade by \nAUSA \nduring a phone call. The government's hearsay argument does nothing but \nsupport Maxwell's request for an evidentiary hearing. \n12 \nEFTA00028945\n\nTwo of the sources in the Daily News article insisted there was a second meeting in the \nsummer of 2016.12\nIn addition, as described above, AUSA in 2021 said she recalls contemplating a \nperjury prosecution of Maxwell. Ex. K, p 5. But if there were only the one meeting, it makes \nlittle sense for \nAUSA \nto have been thinking about a potential perjury prosecution in \nFebruary of 2016, before Maxwell had even been deposed (unless the plan was to set a perjury \ntrap for Maxwell). It is more likely that AUSA contemplated a perjury prosecution after \na second meeting with attorneys, which took place after at least one of Maxwell's \ndepositions. As reported in the Daily News, \"David [Boles] was particularly frustrated by the \nfailure to pursue a perjury \ncharge.s13\n \"We have her dead to rights,\" he said.14\nThis Court cannot accept without further inquiry the government's assertion that there \nwasn't a second meeting or any further contact between the U.S. Attorney's Office and \nattorneys. At a minimum, an evidentiary hearing is required. \n• \nDefense 5: AUSA \nhad no idea what was in Boles Schiller's files. \nThe government stands by the claim that AUSA had \"either little or no \nadditional information than [Judge McMahon did] in terms of what materials there are [and] who \nwas deposed\" and, for all the government knew, the deposition transcripts would show \"page \nafter page of people taking the Fifth.\" See Resp. at 70. The government's Response is not \ncredible. \n12 Supra Note 10. \n13 Supra Note 10. \n14 SUM/ Note 10. \n13 \nEFTA00028946\n\nFor one thing, the government admits that attorneys turned over \nseveral \ndocuments in 2016, which were in the government's possession when AUSA claimed \nto Judge McMahon that he did not know what was in Boies Schiller's file. Moreover, by the time \nAUSA \ntold Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would \nshow \"page after page of people taking the Fifth,\" it was already a matter of public record that \nMaxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p 1. \nThe government's argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge \nMcMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller's entire file. At a minimum, the government \nhad to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to \ndetermine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or \nMaxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the \ngovernment issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the \nProtective Order, and the second for material outside the Protective Order's reach. Clearly, the \ngovernment knew more about Boies Schiller's file than AUSA let on. \n• Defense 6: The \"subject of your investigation\" to whom Judge McMahon \nreferred was Jeffrey Epstein. \nAccording to the government, when Judge McMahon asked AUSA \"about \ncontacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the \nissuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation,\" Mot. Ex. E, p 2, Judge McMahon \nwas referring only to Epstein. Resp. at 71. This is not a plausible reading of the transcript. \nAfter his first appearance before her, Judge McMahon haled AUSA back to \ncourt for one \nreason. \"I'll be very up-front with you,\" she said. Mot. Ex. E, p 2. \n14 \nEFTA00028947\n\nI  want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Battk[15] kind of situation, so I would \nlike to know about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the \nBoies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your \ninvestigation. \nId. (emphasis added). \n\"Tellingly,\"16 Judge McMahon did not ask AUSA about the \"target\" of his \ninvestigation; she asked about its \"subject.\" The \"subject of [the] investigation\" is much broader \nthan its \"target.\" \n\"A `target' is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial \nevidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the \nprosecutor, is a putative defendant.' \"A `subject' of an investigation is a person whose conduct \nis within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.\" The scope of an investigation, in turn, \nincludes not only potential defendants and potential victims, but also the conduct at issue and the \nlocations involved. \nWere there any doubt about Judge McMahon's meaning, she put that doubt to rest in her \nwritten order authorizing the subpoena. Mot. Ex. G, p 21. The \"subject of the investigation,\" she \nexplained, was \"the matters that were the subject of the [defamation] Action.\" Id. And \nhaving asked AUSA about his office's contacts with Boies Schiller \nabout \"the \n15  Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). \n16 \"Tellingly,\" claims the government in the Response, \"Maxwell omits [the phrase 'subject of \nyour investigation'] of this question from her motion.\" Resp. at 70 n.34. Not true. On page 13 of \nMaxwell's Motion, in arguing that AUSA mislead Judge McMahon, Maxwell fully and \ncompletely quotes Judge McMahon's question, just as she does above. Mot. at 13 (quoting Ex. E, p 2). \n11  United States Department of Justice, JUSTICE MANUAL, JM § 9-11.151, Grand Jury, Advice of \n\"Rights\" of Grand Jury Witnesses (updated Jan. 2020), available at: https://www.justice.govijm/jm-9-\n11000-grand-jury#9-11.151 (last accessed Mar. 11, 2021). \n18 Id. \n15 \nEFTA00028948\n\nmatters that were the subject of the [defamation] Action,\" and having been misled by \nAUSA response, Judge McMahon erroneously (though blamelessly) concluded that \n[n]othing in this record suggests to me that or Boies Schiller had anything \nto do with the Government's decision to convene a  grand jury to look into the \nmatters that were the subject of the Action. .  .  There is no evidence of \n\"collusion,\" to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller \ndid not foment the Government's investigation. \nhi. (emphasis added). \nFor her part, AUSA shared the very concern Judge McMahon later expressed to \nAUSA that Boies Schiller was trying to instigate an investigation of Maxwell to \nleverage its position in the \"ME Action.\" Mot. Ex. K, p 3. In the 2021 call, AUSA \nrecalled that the \npending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation . . . gave [her] some pause \nbecause she had other occasions where civil litigants have decided to report \nsomething to the \nUSAO \nbecause they think it will help them in their civil case. \nAUSA \neven mentioned this concern to the Chief of the Criminal Division. Id. If AUSA \nand the Chief of the Criminal Division recognized what was going on, AUSA \ncan hardly feign ignorance.19\nIf the government means to suggest that when Judge McMahon asked about any prior \ncontacts concerning \"the subject of your investigation,\" she was somehow confining her inquiry \nto the time period surrounding November 2018, see Resp. at 90-91, that too is an implausible \nreading of the transcript. If Judge McMahon meant \"subject\" to be a term of art (\"subject\" of the \ninvestigation as opposed to a \"target\" of the investigation), then the government should have \n19  Of \ncourse, if AUSA honestly did not understand Chief Judge McMahon's uestion, \nonce she issued her opinion there could no longer be any doubt. And at that point, AUSA \nwould have been duty-bound to correct the misimpression he had created. N.Y. Rules of Professional \nConduct, Rule. 3.8, cmt. [6A] (\"Like other lawyers, prosecutors are subject to Rule 3.3, which requires a \nlawyer to take reasonable remedial measures to correct material evidence that the lawyer has offered \nwhen the lawyer comes to know of its falsity.\"). \n16 \nEFTA00028949\n\ndisclosed the Boies Schiller contacts for the reasons given above. And if Judge McMahon meant \n\"subject\" to have its everyday meaning, then she was asking about something even broader: \nWhether the U.S. Attorney's Office had contacts with Boies Schiller about the \"subject\"—i.e., \nthe \"conduct\"—being investigated. \nNothing about the transcript supports the government's overly narrow, hindsight-based \ninterpretation of Judge McMahon's question. \n* * * \nFor these reasons, this Court should reject the government's attempt to rewrite the history \nof its investigation and its affirmative misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. \nB. Assuming the Government's Defenses Are Worthy of Belief, the \nGovernment Still Misled the Court. \nEven if the government's account were worthy of belief (which it is not), that doesn't get \nthe government off the hook. \nThe government would like this Court to believe that: (1) the February 29 meeting \nconcerned a prosecution of Epstein only and not Maxwell; and (2) when Judge McMahon asked \nAUSA \nabout his office's prior contacts with Boies Schiller concerning \"the subject of \nits investigation,\" Judge McMahon was referring to Epstein only and not Maxwell. \nEven if those two assertions were true, however, then AUSA still misled \nJudge McMahon and misrepresented the origins of the investigation. Under the government's \nversion of events, \"the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\" Resp. at 89 n.39. If that's \ntrue, \nAUSA \nunquestionably should have told Judge McMahon about the February \n2016 meeting when she asked him \"about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office \nand the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your \ninvestigation\"—i.e., Epstein. AUSA did not tell Chief Judge McMahon about the \n17 \nEFTA00028950\n\ncontacts with Boies Schiller on the topic of Epstein any more than he shared the contacts on the \ntopic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably \nfalse. \nWhether Boies Schiller \"pitched\" a prosecution of Epstein only or of Epstein and \nMaxwell as a duo, \nAUSA \nmisled Judge McMahon by denying there was any \"pitch\" \nwhatsoever. \nIII. The Materiality of the Government's False Statements. \nThe government halfheartedly suggests that \"there is no reason to believe that a \ndescription of the February 2016 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon's \nanalysis of whether she was facing a `Chemical Bank kind of situation.' Resp. at 91. Hardly. In \nfact, there is every reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the \nsubpoena if AUSA had not so misled her. \nHow do we know? Because Judge McMahon said so—at least twice. \nJudge McMahon first made this clear by haling AUSA back in for one and \nonly one reason: To ask him about the contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before \nNovember 2018. So crucial was this question to Judge McMahon's decision that the transcript of \nthe \nAUSA \nsecond appearance before her is just three pages long. Mot. Ex. E. \nJudge McMahon made her thinking even clearer in her written order authorizing the \nsubpoena. Mot. Ex. G. On page 12 of her opinion, when attempting to reconcile Chemical Bank \nwith Martindell,2° Judge McMahon found that \"nothing in the record suggests that the \nGovernment's investigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I \nwill return later in this opinion.\" Mot. Ex. G, p 12. \n20 Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). \n18 \nEFTA00028951\n\nJudge McMahon \"returned\" to that point when discussing whether Maxwell could have \nreasonably relied on the Protective Order: \n[T]heaihing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is \nthat or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank \ndid—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the \npurpose of fomenting an investigation. But I  am not faced with that situation. \nNothing in this record suggests to me that or Boies Schiller had anything to \ndo with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters \nthat were the subject of the Action. On the contrary—the Government has \nadvised the Court that it  contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties \nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the \nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its \nfiles because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of \n\"collusion,\" to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller \ndid not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United \nStates Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies \nSchiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on \nhis/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. \nId. at 21. \nContrary to Judge McMahon's understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government \n(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of \"collusion\"; it was \"quite clear that \nBoies Schiller did . . . foment the Government's investigation\"; and AUSA knew \nmuch more about what was in Boies Schiller's files than he let on. \nThe Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant \nattempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred. \nJudge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knowing all the facts. AUSA on \nthe other hand, had a \"complete handle on the landscape,\" and he withheld the truth from Judge \nMcMahon. Had AUSA not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have \nauthorized the subpoena.' \n21 \nIt's notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA la Judge McMahon \nwrongly concluded that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order. In fact, the \n19 \nEFTA00028952\n\nIV. The Remedy for the Government's Misconduct. \nA. Pursuant to its Inherent Power, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence \nObtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are \nthe Fruits of that Evidence. \nThis Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among \nthe parties. McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 340 (1943). \"Judges have an obligation to \nexercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility \nthat 'implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and \nevidence.'\" United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting McNabb, 318 \nU.S. at 340). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, \"Federal courts may use \ntheir supervisory power in some circumstances to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by \n'willful disobedience of law.\"' 447 U.S. 727, 735 (1980) (quoting McNabb, 318 U.S. at 345) \n(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 223 (1960); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, \n216-17 (1956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in \njudgment)). A court should invoke its supervisory power of suppression when \"there has been a \nfraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant's rights.\" United States v. \nCortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980). \nIn United States v.  Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit \nsubscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation \nof FBI Agent William Id. at 1208. Unbeknownst to Agent Stewart, Agent \nSecond Circuit in v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon's ruling that Maxwell had \nreasonably relied on the Protective Order's guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore \nredacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those \"deposition responses concerning \nintimate matters where the questions were likely only permitted—and the responses only compelled—\nbecause of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing \nFed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has \nreleased on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the \nProtective Order. \n20 \nEFTA00028953\n\nreports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had \nwith, and information provided by, a confidential informant. Id. at 1212-13. The Court of \nAppeals affirmed the district court's order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search \nconducted under the warrant. Id. at 1213. \"This search,\" said the Court, \"never should have taken \nplace.\" Id. \nThe Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm \nthe district court's conclusion that Agent intentionally or recklessly misrepresented \nmaterial information in Agent affidavit. Id. But the Court went further, concluding that \nsuppression was independently required as a matter of inherent authority. Id. at 1214-17. \nBecause Agent lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), \"[t]he call \nfor the court's supervisory power under then circumstances is at its strongest and most \ndefensible.\" Id. at 1214. \nThe Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to \nsuppress evidence or \"merely [to] disagree with the method[s] of law enforcement.\" Id. \"[T]he \nfederal supervisory power does not give `the federal judiciary a `chancellor's foot' veto over law \nenforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Russell, 411 \nU.S. 423,435 (1973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to \"prevent[] the court \nfrom condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it.\" Id. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful \ngovernmental conduct and to protect judicial integrity. Id. (weighing \"the deterrent values of \npreventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated ... and the need to \nprotect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding `probative but \ntainted \nevidence\"). \n21 \nEFTA00028954\n\nMaxwell had a due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the \ngovernment's request to modify the Protective Order and issue a subpoena to Boies Schiller. \nMot. Ex. A, 1  14 (permitting modification of the Protective Order only \"for good cause shown \nfollowing notice to all parties and an opportunity to be heard\"); Mot. Ex. H (Judge Netbum \ndenying the government's ex parte request to modify the Jane Doe 43 Protective Order in part \nbecause the government was attempting to deprive Maxwell of notice and an opportunity to be \nheard); Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; see U.S. CONST. amend. V. Maxwell also had a privacy \ninterest in the materials subject to the subpoena, including most especially her deposition \ntranscripts. Mot. Ex. A (defining \"confidential\" material as that which \"implicates common law \nand statutory privacy interests of ... Ghislaine Maxwell\"); see U.S. CONST. amend. IV. The \ngovernment violated these rights when it secured an ex pane modification of the Protective \nOrder based on materially false statements to Judge McMahon. In resisting any sanction for its \nmisconduct, and in denying that Maxwell should even be afforded a hearing, the government \nasks this Court to \"condon[e] a fraud perpetrated upon it.\" See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. \nTo be sure, AUSA \nmisled Judge McMahon in answering the singular question \nshe posed, and he did so with full knowledge of the facts. AUSA misrepresentations \nwere material to Judge McMahon's decision, because she would not have modified the \nProtective Order if AUSA had been candid about Boies Schiller's role in initiating \nthe investigation. As Judge McMahon put it, \"the only thing on which Maxwell... might \nreasonably have relied is that or her lawyers\" would not approach prosecutors and \n\"foment the Government's investigation.\" Mot. Ex. G, p 21. I. That is, in fact, exactly what \nhappened. As in Cortina, the modification of the Protective Order \"never should have taken \nplace.\" Id. When, as here, a prosecutor—from the public corruption unit no less-misrepresents \n22 \nEFTA00028955\n\nmaterial information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, \"[t]he call for the court's \nsupervisory power ... is at its strongest and most defensible.\" Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. \nMaxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) in \norder to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a \nFranks hearing, a defendant must make a \"substantial preliminary showing,\" United States v. \nFalso, 544 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56), that (i) there were \n\"inaccuracies or omissions\" in the affidavit, (ii) \"the alleged falsehoods or omissions were \nnecessary to the issuing judge's probable cause or necessity finding,\" and (iii) \"the claimed \ninaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant's deliberate falsehood or reckless \ndisregard for the truth.\" United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2018). Here, there \nis no dispute that (i) AUSA representations to Judge McMahon were false and \nmisleading, (ii) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the \nsubpoena if AUSA had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA statements \nwere deliberately false, since he had a \"complete handle on the landscape\" months before he \nappeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon. \nNor need Maxwell prove \"outrageous government conduct\" to obtain relief. Were that \nher burden, however, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. \"The concept of fairness embodied \nin the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is \nfundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of justice.\" United States v. Schmidt, \n105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, \"a \ndefendant must show that the government's conduct is `so outrageous that common notions of \nfairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a \n23 \nEFTA00028956\n\nconviction.'\" United States v. Bout, 731 F.3d 233, 238 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. \nSchmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d \nCir. 1997)). \nHere, it would \"shock the conscience\" to permit a prosecutor to make false statements to \na federal judge to circumvent another judge's duly-entered order, all in violation of the \ndefendant's due process, privacy, and Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The only way to \nprevent Maxwell from suffering unconstitutional prejudice because of the government's \nmisconduct is to suppress the evidence the government unlawfully obtained and to dismiss \nCounts 5 and 6. \n* * * \nAUSA \nbreached two separate but equally consequential duties: The duty of a \npublic prosecutor and the duty of candor. \n\"[T]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate; his \nduty is to seek justice, not merely to convict.\" Young v.  United States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). \nProsecutors are held to a higher standard, and for good reason. \"[The prosecutor] is in a peculiar \nand very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not \nescape or innocence suffer.\" Berger v.  United States, 295 U.S. 78, \n88 (1935). \nMoreover, \"[i]n light of the prosecutor's public responsibilities, broad authority and \ndiscretion, the prosecutor has a heightened duty of candor to the courts and in fulfilling other \nprofessional obligations.\" ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-\n1.4 (4th ed. 2017). \"While all lawyers owe a duty of honesty and candor to the Court, `this \nobligation lies most heavily upon [public prosecutors] who are not merely partisan advocates, but \npublic officials charged with administering justice honestly, fairly and impartially.\" Morales v. \nPortuondo, 165 F. Supp. 2d 601, 612 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \n24 \nEFTA00028957\n\nIn turn, this already high standard ratchets up even higher when a prosecutor appears \nbefore the court ex parte. \"The duty of candor is, if anything, more critical when ex parte \napplications are made to a court.\" hr re WinNet R CJSC, 2017 WL 1373918, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. No. \n16MC484(DLC), Apr. 13, 2017); see N.Y. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.3(d) (\"In an ex \npane proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that \nwill enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.\"); see \nalso id. cmt. [14]. And it \"is not a defense to claim that, while factual statements to the Court \nwere materially misleading, they were not literally false. Attorneys are officers of the Court, and \nour system of justice cannot operate efficiently if the Court cannot rely on the candor of counsel \npresenting an application for ex parte relief.\" Four Star Fin. Servs., LLC v.  Commonwealth \nMgmt. Assocs., 166 F. Supp. 2d 805, 810 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \nAUSA \nfailed to live up to these standards. In an ex parte proceeding, AUSA \naffirmatively misled Judge McMahon, with full knowledge of what issue concerned \nJudge McMahon and what information would be material to her decision. When, as here, \"there \nhas been a fraud upon the court,\" Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216, \"[t]he court has inherent authority \nto regulate the administration of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] \nexclud[ing] evidence taken from the defendant by willful disobedience of law,\" id. at 1214. \nUnited States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) (\"It is within the court's inherent \nauthority to suppress evidence gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own \nproceedings....\"). \n25 \nEFTA00028958\n\nB. At a Minimum, this Court Should Order a Hearing at which Maxwell \nMay Inquire into the Circumstances Surrounding the Government's \nMisrepresentation to Judge McMahon. \n\"An evidentiary hearing is normally required to address motions to suppress where a \nfactual issue is in dispute.\" United States v. Paredes-Cordova, \nNo. \nSI 03 CR. 987DAB, 2009 \nWL 1585776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009); United States v. Pena, 961 F.2d 333, 339 (2d \nCir. \n1992) (\"[A]n evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress ordinarily is required if the moving \npapers are sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural to enable the court to \nconclude that contested issues of fact going to the validity of the search are in question.\" \n(quotation omitted))). Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that \nMaxwell at least is entitled to a hearing. \nThere is no merit to the government's assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing \nbecause she has not submitted an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a \nprerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to \nentitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing. \nNor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession \nof the government (e.g., AUSA and AUSA or others who are adverse to \nMaxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger). See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216 (\"The \nviolation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an \n[ex parte submission]. The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within \nthe hands of the government.\"). Since Maxwell was not at the February 29 meeting or copied on \nany of the emails or communications that followed, the Response does not explain how Maxwell \ncould possibly submit an affidavit attesting to the government's misrepresentations based on \npersonal knowledge. \n26 \nEFTA00028959\n\nThe government of course does not suggest that any of its agents, such as AUSA \nII, would be willing to provide an affidavit to Maxwell or otherwise speak with defense \ncounsel absent compulsion from this Court. Indeed, the government conspicuously did not attach \nto its Response any affidavits about its interactions with Boies Schiller. \nIt's plain, therefore, that this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and effectuate \nMaxwell's constitutional right to compulsory process because that is the only way to get to the \ntruth.22\nConclusion \nFor these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all \nevidence the government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived \ntherefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived \ntherefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this \nMotion. \nDated: March 15, 2021 \n22  If this Court concludes an affidavit is required before it holds a hearing, Maxwell requests \nleave, as she did in her Motion, to attempt to obtain such an affidavit. But if, as is likely, none of the \nparticipants—e.g., AUSA , AUSA Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger—voluntarily \nprovides an affidavit, Maxwell invokes her constitutional right to compulsory process and this Court's \nauthority to compel testimony in support of her defense.
