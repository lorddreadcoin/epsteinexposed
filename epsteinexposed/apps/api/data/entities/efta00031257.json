A lot of questions about record keeping practices are about present practices, but I would guess things may have \nbeen different in 1997, so you'll want to navigate that in your meeting with him and adjust the questions \naccordingly. \n2. The closing questions (after the record is in evidence) ask the witness to read out loud on the open record the \nidentifying information for MV1, so you'll need to adjust those. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, November 14, 2021 1:31 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Paul Kane Q&A \nHe' \nAttached is a draft Paul Kane Q&A. There are a couple questions that may seem weird —  basically, since PCS didn't create \nthis record, the questions are aimed at a line of Second Circuit cases holding that \"Records maintained but not created by \na company may be admissible as business records of that company if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into \n[the] company's records and relied upon in its day-to-day operations.\" United States v. Kuthuru, 665 F. App'x 34, 39 (2d Cir. \n2016). \nLet's chat about the other hearsay issue when you have a minute? \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 Saint Andrews Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00031257\n\nEFTA00031258",
