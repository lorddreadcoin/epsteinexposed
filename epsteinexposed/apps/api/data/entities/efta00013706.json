I  am waiting for a call \nback from Barry about the date. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax 561 820-8777 \nFrom: (USAFLS) \nSent: Tuesday, November 27, 2007 1:55 PM \nTo: Jay Lefkowitz \nCc: Acosta, Alex (USAFLS) \nSubject: Epstein \nJay, \nPlease accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather yesterday. I hope that \nyou enjoyed your Thanksgiving. \nRegarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few observations. First, Guy Lewis \nhas known for some time that Judge Davis was making reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg \nfor this assignment. In fact, when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21\", \nyou and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the selection. Podhurst and \nJosephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, \nand, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and \nJosephsberg have long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine how \nmuch more vetting needs to be done. \nThe United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming \nevents and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by the United States and Mr. Epstein in a  timely \nfashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting \nEFTA00013706\n\nprocess come to an end. Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB \ntomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give me the go-ahead on \nPodhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously send you a draft of the letter. I intend to \nnotify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, November 29th. Thanks, \n• \nEFTA00013707",
