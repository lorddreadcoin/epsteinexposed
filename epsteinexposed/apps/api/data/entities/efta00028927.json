Plaintiff contends that requests targeting \nsuch privileged information are not reasonably calculated \nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, are not \nimportant to resolving the issues, are not relevant to any \nparty's claim or defense, are not proportional to the needs \nof the case, and creates a heavy burden on Plaintiff that \noutweighs its benefit. Therefore, Plaintiff has employed \ncategorical logging pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c). \nThis categorical entry is regarding correspondence re the \ncurrently ongoing criminal investigation of Defendant and \nothers. \nPublic Interest Withheld \napprox. 57 \ndocuments \nEFTA00028928",
