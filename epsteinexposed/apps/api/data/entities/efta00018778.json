On August 15, 2019, \nDefendants Indyke and Kahn filed a \nEFTA00018780\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 Page 4 of 55 \nGVI v. \nEstate of Jeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's First \nAmended Complaint \nPage \n3 of 55 \nPetition \nfor Probate and \nLetters Testamentary \nwhich included \nEpstein's last will \nand testament \nwith the Probate \nDivision of the Superior Court of \nthe Virgin Islands. \n11. The \nPetition reports the value \nof the real and personal \nproperty in The Estate \nlocated \nin the Virgin Islands at $577,672,654.00 dollars. \n12. \nAccording to the Petition, the assets in the \nVirgin Islands thus far includes: \na. $56.5 \nmillion in cash; \nb. $127 million in fixed income and equity investments; \nc. $195 million in hedge fund and private equity investments; and \nd. $18.5 million in planes, boats, and automobiles. \nThe Estate has not yet valued his fine arts, \nantiques, and other valuables. \n13.

The \nTrust also contains \nEpstein's \nfinancial assets and is \nalso responsible to \npay \ndamages \nfor the \nacts committed by Epstein \nand the Epstein \nEnterprise described below. \nDefendants Indyke \nand Kahn, filed a \nCertificate of Trust in the \nSuperior Court of the Virgin \nIslands \nfor The \nTrust on \nAugust 26, 2019. \n17. \nEpstein maintained a  deliberately complex web of Virgin \nIslands corporations, \nlimited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are \nyet known to the \nGovernment of the Virgin Islands, through which he \ncarried out and concealed his criminal \nconduct. \n18. Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred \nproperties and \nfunds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and conceal \nthe unlawful acts \ndescribed in this Complaint. \n19. These entities held \nproperties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at \nwhich Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned \nand \narranged for private \nplanes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and \nwithin the Virgin Islands, and provided money to \npay these young women and underage girls. \n20. \nEpstein sat at the hub of this web, \nserving as president, member, manager, or \ndirector of each of \nthe entities and, upon information and belief, directing their \nactivities. \n21. Defendant, Nautilus, \nInc., is a corporation established and \norganized under the laws \nof the Virgin Islands. It  was incorporated on November 22, 20 \nI  I . \n22. \nAccording to records of \nthe Virgin Islands Recorder of \nDeeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns \nLittle St. James, a/k/a \nParcel Number 109803010100, a \nparcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at \n$3.2 \nmillion, with buildings and \nimprovements valued at $4 million. \nEFTA00018782\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document \n1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 \nPage 6 of 55 \nGVI v. Estate of \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's First \nAmended \nComplaint \nPage 5 \nof 55 \n23. \nEpstein was president and director \nof Nautilus, Inc., which corporate \nfilings \ndescribe as \"holding property for personal use.\" Defendants \nIndyke and Kahn are the secretary and \ntreasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values \nEpstein's holdings of Nautilus, Inc., \nwhich holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. \n24. A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder \nof Deeds on December 30, 2011 \nreflects that the property was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, Inc. for \n\"TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.\" The quitclaim deed lists \nJeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James via a \nwarranty deed \ndated April 27, 1998. \n25. As described below, Epstein engaged in a  pattern and practice of trafficking and \nsexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. \nJames where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin \nIslands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from \nleaving freely and \nescaping the abuse. \n26. Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing \nEpstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality \nof those crimes. \n27. Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a  limited liability company established and \norganized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was \norganized on October 26, \n2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin \nIslands Recorder of Deeds, owns at \nleast three properties that make up Great St. \nJames acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number \n109801010100, consisting of 3.5 million square \nfeet and valued at $17.5 million; Parcel Number \n109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of \nland, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel \nNumber 109801010300, 1.2 million square \nfeet of land, valued at $2.7 million. \nAccording to a \nEFTA00018783\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP \nDocument \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 \nPage 7 of 55 \nGVI v. Estate \nof Jeffrey Epstein \nGVI's \nFirst Amended \nComplaint \nPage 6 of 55 \nwarranty deed filed with the \nVirgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, \nEpstein, through Great St. Jim, \nLLC, acquired \nthe last two parcels for $5 million \neach. \n28. Epstein is listed as manager and a \nmember of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of \nits business is \ndescribed as \"holding assets.\" \n29. Upon information and belief, \nEpstein purchased these Great St. James properties—\nthe island with closest proximity to \nLittle St. James—to further shield his conduct on Little St. \nJames from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the \npublic, and allow him to \ncontinue and conceal his criminal \nenterprise. Epstein's significant investment in the purchase of \nGreat St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal operation in the Virgin Islands for \nyears to come. Thus. Great St. Jim, LLC participated in carrying out, concealing, \nfacilitating and \ncontinuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. \n30. Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws \nof the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was president \nand director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as \"holding \nproperty \nfor personal use.-  \nDefendants \nIndyke and \nKahn are secretary and \ntreasurer of Poplar, Inc., \nrespectively. \n31. A  certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural \nResources (\"DPNR\") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the \nincorporators to conduct \"transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great \nSt. Jim, LLC.\" \n32. Poplar, Inc. is listed as the \nsignatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, \nLLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and \nLetters Testamentary \nEFTA00018784\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 8 of 55 \nGVI \nv. Estate \nof Jeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's First Amended Complaint \nPage 7 of 55 \nfiled by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. \nparticipated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes. \n33. Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a  limited liability company established and organized \nunder the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, \n2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski. was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole \nmanager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal \nbehind Plan D, LLC. \n34. Upon information and belief, Plan D, LLC \nowns one or more of the airplanes and \nhelicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and \nchildren to and from the Virgin Islands \nto carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes \nowned by Plan \nD, \nLLC is a  Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel \nnotices indicate that \nEpstein used this plane to traffic and transport \nand young women and underage girls to the Virgin \nIslands. \n35. \nDefendant, Hyperion Air, LLC \nis a  limited liability company \nestablished and \norganized \nunder the laws of the Virgin \nIslands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey \nEpstein is a \nmanager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, \nalong with his pilot, Larry Visoski. \nThe purpose of \nHyperion \nAir, LLC is listed in its Annual \nReport as - holding \nassets.' \n36. \nHyperion Air, LLC is the registered \nowner of a  Bell helicopter with \nN -number \nN331JE and a Keystone \nhelicopter with N-number \nN722JE. Upon information and belief, \nEpstein \nused these \nhelicopters to transport young women \nand underage girls between St. \nThomas and Little \nSt. James. \n37. \nDefendant Southern \nTrust Company, Inc. was \noriginally incorporated in the \nVirgin \nIslands on November \n18, 2011 as Financial \nInformatics, Inc., but \nchanged its name to \nSouthern \nEFTA00018785\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP \nDocument \n1111-1 \nFiled \n09/01/20 \nPage \n9 \nof \n55 \nGVI \nv. \nEstate \nof \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's \nFirst \nAmended \nComplaint \nPage \n8 \nof \n55 \nTrust \nCompany \nin \nSeptember \n2012. \nSouthern \nTrust \nCompany \nis \na  \ntenant \nat \nAmerican \nYacht \nHarbor \nin \nRed \nHook, \nSt. \nThomas, \nand \nEpstein \nis \na \n\"passive \ninvestor\" \nin \nIGY-AYH, \nd/b/a \nAmerican \nYacht \nHarbor. \nBy \nthe \nend \nof \n2013, \naccording \nto \nits \ncorporate \nfilings, \nSouthern \nTrust \nCompany \nhas \nassets \nof \n$198.5 \nmillion; \nfour \nyears \nlater, \nits \nassets \nreached \n$391.3 \nmillion. \nFrom \n2011 \nuntil \nat \nleast \n2018, \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nwas \nthe \nPresident/Director \nof \nSouthern \nTrust \nCompany, \nand \nDefendants \nKahn \nand \nIndyke \nwere \nTreasurer/Director \nand \nSecretary/Director, \nrespectively. \nEpstein \nwas \nthe \nsole \nowner \nof \nSouthern \nTrust \nCompany. \n38. \nJohn \nand \nJane \nDoes \nrepresent \nindividuals \nand \nentities \nwhose \nidentities \nor \ninvolvement \nwith \nEpstein \nare \ncurrently \nunknown. \nThe \nGovernment \nof \nthe \nVirgin \nIslands \nwill \namend \nthe \nComplaint \nto \nadd \nthese \nindividuals \nand \nentities \nwhen \ndiscovered. \n39. \nThe \nAttorney \nGeneral \nbrings \nthis \naction \nto \nseek \nall \nremedies \navailable \nto \nthe \nGovernment \nof \nthe \nVirgin \nIslands \nin \nenforcing \nits \nlaws \nand \nprotecting \nthe \npublic \ninterest \nand \npublic \nsafety. \nThese \nclaims \nare \ndistinct \nfrom, \nand \nare \nnot \nintended \nto \nsupplant, \nthe \nclaims \nof \nvictims \nwho \nwere \nunconscionably \nharmed \nby \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nand \nhis \nassociates. \nFACTUAL \nALLEGATIONS \nA. \nThe \nConduct \nof \nthe \n\"Epstein \nEnterprise\" \nin \nthe \nVirgin \nIslands \n40. \nEpstein \nand \nhis \nassociates, \nincluding \nDefendants, \nidentified \nand \nrecruited \nfemale \nvictims, \nincluding \nchildren, \nand \ntransported \nthem \nto \nthe \nVirgin \nIslands \nwhere \nthey \nwere \nabused \nand \ninjured. \nEpstein, \nthrough \nand \nin \nassociation \nwith \nDefendants, \ntrafficked, \nraped, \nsexually \nassaulted \nand \nheld \ncaptive \nunderage \ngirls \nand \nyoung \nwomen \nat \nhis \nproperties \nin \nthe \nVirgin \nIslands. \n41. \nEpstein \ncreated \na  \nnetwork \nof \ncompanies \nand \nindividuals \nwho \nparticipated \nin \nand \nconspired \nwith \nhim \nin \na  \npattern \nof \ncriminal \nactivity \nrelated \nto \nthe \nsex \ntrafficking, \nforced \nlabor, \nsexual \nassault, \nchild \nabuse, \nand \nsexual \nservitude \nof \nthese \nyoung \nwomen \nand \nchildren. \nEpstein \nand \nEFTA00018786\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 Page 10 of \n55 \nGVI v. \nEstate of Jeffrey Epstein \nGVI's \nFirst Amended Complaint \nPage 9 of 55 \nhis \nassociates trafficked underage \ngirls to the Virgin Islands, held \nthem captive, and sexually \nabused them, \ncausing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. \n42. To accomplish his illegal \nends, Epstein formed an association in fact with \nmultiple \nDefendants \nand others (both companies and \nindividuals) who were willing to participate in, \nfacilitate, and \nconceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for \nEpstein's bestowal of financial \nand \nother benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from \nvictims. \n43. This illicit association of \nEpstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what is \nreferred to herein as the \n\"Epstein \nEnterprise.\" \nEpstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, \nincluding, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, and \nconcealed Epstein's illegal \nconduct. \n44. Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which engaged \nin a  pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and subjecting \nunderage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. \n45. The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a  pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin \nIslands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of vulnerable \nfemale children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's desires, and those \nof his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available \nyoung women and \nunderage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor \nand sexual activities and used \ncoercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims. \n46. Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the \nEpstein \nEnterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin \nIslands, who were then taken \nvia \nhelicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were \nthen deceptively subjected to \nEFTA00018787\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP \nDocument \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 \nPage 11 of \n55 \nGVI v. Estate of \nJeffrey Epstein \nGVI's First \nAmended Complaint \nPage 10 of 55 \nsexual \nservitude, forced to engage in sexual \nacts and coerced into \ncommercial sexual activity and \nforced labor. \n47. In furtherance of its \ncriminal activities, the Epstein \nEnterprise used its aircraft to \ntransport the young \nwomen and underage girls to the \nVirgin Islands for purposes of sexual abuse \nand exploitation. \n48. The Epstein Enterprise facilitated \nand participated in the sexual molestation and \nexploitation of numerous girls between \nthe age of 12 and 17 years old. \n49. On \nthe pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, \nassociates of the Epstein \nEnterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young \nwomen and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands \nwhere, upon \ninformation and belief, based on the pattern and \npractice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were \nsexually abused and exploited. \n50. Associates \nin the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the \nEpstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and \nwitnessed Epstein \nand others engage in sexual acts with \nchildren. \n51. As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers \nand other airport personnel reported seeing \nEpstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and \n18 \nyears. \n52. Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and sexually \nabusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the \nVirgin Islands through 2018. \n53. When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein \nnever denied engaging in sexual acts with \nunderage females and procuring underage females for \nEFTA00018788\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document \n1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 \nPage 12 of 55 \nGV1 v. Estate of Jeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's First \nAmended Complaint \nPage 11 of 55 \nprostitution, but instead \nconsistently invoked his Fifth \nAmendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. \n54. \nUpon information and belief, the Epstein \nEnterprise kept a  computerized list of \nunderage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, \nand able to be transported to \nEpstein's \nresidence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. \n55. The Epstein Enterprise \nengaged in a  pattern of criminal conduct by \ntrafficking \nchildren and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced \nlabor in the Virgin \nIslands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to 138, which \nprohibit \ntrafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child \nabuse and neglect, including 14 \nV.I.C. \n§ 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly \nor recklessly causing \"a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury,\" or causing a child \nto be placed in a situation where such injury is \nforeseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as \nhere, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. \nThe harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. \n56. The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, \ntransported, transferred, harbored, \nreceived, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to engage \nin forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little St. \nJames \nresidence. \n57. A  15 year old victim was forced \ninto sexual acts with Epstein and others and then \nattempted to escape by swimming off the \nLittle St. James island.

The Epstein Enterprise \ntransported, held, sexually abused, \ntrafficked, and \nconcealed women and children at \nhis property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times \nover nearly \ntwo \ndecades. \nB. The \"Epstein Enterprise\" Abused Privileges of \nResidency to Carry out its \nCriminal Scheme \n66. The Epstein \nEnterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as \nthe perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual \nservitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St. James is a secluded, private island, nearly two \nmiles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; \nno public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or \noff \nthe island, and no \nbridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the \nprivate airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and \nchildren he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and \nassistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. \n67. In 2016, upon information and belief, using a  straw purchaser to hide Epstein's \nidentity, \nthe Epstein \nEnterprise acquired \nGreat St. \nJames the \nnearest island \nto Little St. \nJames. By \nthen, Epstein was a \nconvicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise \npurchased the island \nfor more than $20 million because its participants wanted to \nensure that the \nisland did not \nbecome a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring \nownership and control of Great St. James to the \nexclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created \nEFTA00018791\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP \nDocument \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 \nPage 15 of \n55 \nGVI \nv. Estate of \nJeffrey Epstein \nGVI's First Amended \nComplaint \nPage 14 of 55 \nadditional barriers to prevent those \nheld involuntarily on Little \nSt. James from escaping \nor \nobtaining help from others. \n68. \nGreat St. James and Little St. \nJames are environmentally sensitive \nlocations, with \nnative coral and wildlife \nprotected by federal and territorial law \nand enforcement authorities. \nThe \nDepartment of \nPlanning and Natural Resources \n(\"DPNR\") regulates and monitors construction in \nthe \nCoastal Zone to protect, maintain and \nmanage the precious natural resources \nof the Virgin \nIslands. Under its authority, \nDPNR repeatedly issued citations and \nassessed thousands of dollars \nof fines for violations of the Virgin Islands \nconstruction code and environmental protection laws \non both Little St. James and \nGreat St. James—significant penalties to the \nagency and to the average \nresident of the \nVirgin Islands. But because of Epstein's enormous \nwealth, these fines had little \neffect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's \nunlawful conduct or conforming its activities \nto the law. \n69. As a  result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin \nIslands has \nincurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction \nor \nremediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. \nJames and Great St. James. The \nextent of the potential environmental damage is \nunknown at this time as the illegal construction \nhas not been removed or remediated. \n70. The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities \nfrom conducting random inspections on the Little St. James \nand Great St. James necessary to \ncomply with Virgin Islands law. \n71. The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was \npart of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the \nlaw. Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook \nEFTA00018792\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document \n1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 \nPage 16 of 55 \n• \nGVI v. Estate of Jeffrey \nEpstein \nGVI's First Amended Complaint \nPage 15 of 55 \nconstruction at Great \nSt. James after 2016 to continue the scheme \nto carry out and conceal his \ntrafficking and sexual \nabuse of young women and children in the \nVirgin Islands. These actions \nare also indicative of \nthe Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The \nEpstein \nEnterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, \nresources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. Rather \nthan participating \nlawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took \nadvantage of the \nsecluded nature of the \nislands in furtherance of its \ncrimes. \n72. As a  result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has \nsubjected the Virgin Islands to public \nportrayals as a  hiding place for human trafficking and sex \ncrimes. \nC. The \"Epstein Enterprise\" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct \n73. The Epstein \nEnterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by \nthe Government of the Virgin Islands. \n74. The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly \nused by the \nEpstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, transferring, \nharboring, receiving, providing, isolating, \npatronizing, maintaining, deceiving, coercing, and \nsexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. \n75. The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law enforcement, \ndespite the fact that Epstein was a \nregistered sex offender. Given the isolation of the Little St. \nJames and Great St. James and the nature of the \ncrimes and of the victims targeted by the Epstein \nEnterprise, \nthe activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. Moreover, \nEpstein's \ngreat wealth and \npower likely made witnesses reluctant to report their \nobservations to the local law \nenforcement. \nEFTA00018793\n\nCase \n1:15-cv-07433-LAP \nDocument \n1111-1 Filed \n09/01/20 \nPage 17 of \n55 \nGVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein \nGVI's First Amended Complaint \nPage 16 of 55 \n76. Upon information and belief, the Epstein \nEnterprise prevented its employees from \ncooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to \nsign confidentiality \nagreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing \ninformation with law enforcement. If \nthey were contacted by law enforcement they were to \nnotify the Epstein Enterprise and be \nrepresented by \nEpstein's counsel. \n77. The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests \nvisiting \nLittle St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that \noccurred on the island. \n78. Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly \nvictims in and out on private planes and \nhelicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the \nEpstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. \n79. Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act (\"SORCPA\") 14 \nV.I.C. § 1721, et seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make \nperiodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. \n80. Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, \nbeyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited—or attempted to visit—\nLittle St. James to conduct additional address verifications. \n81. At his last \nverification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands \nDepartment of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, \nto enter Little St. James \nbeyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his \"front door.\" \nInstead, Epstein arranged to be met \nat his office on St. Thomas. \n82. Epstein also misled \nthe Government regarding his travel plans. On March \n19, 2019, \nthe Virgin \nIslands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for \n10 days on the private \nplane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification \nform did not disclose travel to any other \ncountries. \nEFTA00018794\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 18 of 55 \nGVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein \nGVI's First Amended Complaint \nPage 17 of 55 \nIt was later found by law enforcement \nauthorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco \nduring that trip. \n83. Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to \nprevent DPNR from conducting routine \nsite visits to inspect \nunpermitted and potentially damaging construction \nactivity on Great St. James. \nThe Epstein \nEnterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR's inspections \nreferring to them as \"invasions-\nof Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in \nhis home, which he described defined as the \nentire \nisland. These DPNR inspections are \nrequired for all construction and Virgin Islands \nresidents are \nrequired to cooperate with the \ninspections to assure compliance with \nthe law throughout the \nconstruction phases. \n84. These efforts represent \nEpstein Enterprise's intent to \nconceal its unlawful activity \non Little St. James and Great St. James. \n85. \nThe Epstein Enterprise also \ncreated numerous corporations \nand limited liability \ncompanies in the Virgin \nIslands to help conceal its unlawful \nactivity. Most of these \ncompanies \nwere created in 2011 and \n2012, soon after Epstein registered \nas a sex offender in the Virgin \nIslands. \n86.

The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the \nGovernment and \nFund its Criminal Activities \n104. In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits from \nthe Economic Development Commission (\"EDC\"). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin Islands \nEconomic Development Authority (\"EDA\"), a  semi-autonomous governmental instrumentality \ncreated and governed pursuant to 29 VIC §  1101. \n105.
