Hope that's true \nfor you and yours too. \nIn terms of the issues below, unfortunately there isn't any progress — it's not a delay on our end, we've run the taint \nscreen and so the AUSAs and agents all have access on Relativity to the materials that sent over in December. We \nalso sent the privilege taint terms to the agents a couple weeks ago so they could run the screen on whatever programs \nthey may be using —  that's attached. We hadn't realized that they were impeded on their review due to any taint issue, \nwe just thought they were using Relativity, same as us. \nMore generally though, the issue we continue to have is the same one since February. We have absolutely no sense of \nwhat sent to us — it's not organized or identified by device or even by location, the documents aren't joined with \ntheir attachments (their \"families\" in the terms of doc review), we can't look at native files, etc. It's all the issues from my \nMarch 9 email, below, which never responded to. And it's only 1.4 million documents out of what are presumably \ntens of millions total —  we haven't gotten any version of the rest (and don't know exactly what we're missing, because \nagain, we have no way to track what we've been given so far). \nIf (and/or others at CART) are teleworking, it would be great to get help on this, because obviously weeks are going \nby that we could be using to review. I had been trying to push my chiefs for a meeting in early March but then obviously \nthe world imploded! So not sure what can be done currently, but happy to discuss with anybody that would be useful. \nthanks as always, \nFrom: (NY) (FBI) \n<spwatson@fbi.gov>\nSent: Monday, March 30, 2020 13:23 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nhope you are doing well and more importantly feeling well!

And then instead of keeping them organized or labeled by room, or even by office \nbuilding, all 1.3 million documents (so far) just got dumped into one big pile —  except before that, any documents that \nhad multiple parts stapled together got separated.

Did you take a  look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? \nThe excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we \nsent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you \nmean by \"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring \nto as \"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just \npartial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nEFTA00032142\n\nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see the \nattached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only \nis that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense \ncounsel. \nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have \nthe native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it \neffectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \nRelated, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of \nnumbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual \nlarge file in the native files, it would be impossible. \nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to \nget a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a \nmillion documents without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary \nrecord-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also \nattaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if \nthat's useful. \nthanks, \nFrom: (NY) (FBI) <> \nSent: Wednesday, March 04, 2020 16:36 \nTo: \n(NY) (FBI) <spwatson@fbi.gov>• (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <CRozier@usa.doj.gov>;\n(FBI) ca°\nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(USANYS) \n>; \n(NY) \nHere is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points \nof clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 \ndrives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All \nthe loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. \nOnly 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. \nI will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the \ntool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. \nSpreadsheet is attached. \nNYO CART Coordinator \nSenior Forensic Examiner \nFrom: \n1 \n[mailto: \nSent: Tuesday, March 03, 2020 12:25 PM \n1 \nEFTA00032143\n\nTo: \n• \n(NY) \n(FBI) ce \n(NY) (FBI) <spwatson@fbi.gov>; (USANYS) \n(USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <Christopher.Rozier@usdoj.gov>•\n; \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(NY) (FBI) 'c=w \n) \nI could do Thursday morning, but I think it would be helpful for us to get the accounting in advance of the meeting so \nwe can figure out in advance what (if any) additional steps we need — is that possible? \nFrom: (NY) \n(FBI) <M\n,. \nSent: Tuesday, March 03, 2020 09:59 \nTo: \n(USANYS) \n(NY) \n(FBI) <spwatson@fbi.gov>• (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <CRozier@usa.doj,gov>; \n)<=w; \na>; \n(NY) \n(FBI) < \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nCan we do Thursday morning?

And \nwhat I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the \ntwo search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed \nand/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. \nSomething roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the \nattached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples.

They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated \nwe delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only \nlocal work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that \nall windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from \nNY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be \nproduced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the \"kitchen\" mac has been \nproduced. Still working on the rest. \nNY CART Coordinator \nSenior Forensic Examiner \nOn Feb \n23, 2020 12:21 AM,' \nTeam, \n< \nwrote: \nFollowing up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make \nsense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on \nwhich files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the \nmaterials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., \nwhich devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, \netc. \nBased on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are \napproximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even \ncounting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, \nincluding multiple servers /  server racks. \nSo we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving \npieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from \nTuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of \ntime to schedule a productive meeting. \nthanks all, \noj.gov>; \nEFTA00032145\n\nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, February 15, 2020 16:30 \nTo: .

Ultimately what we really \nneed is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same \ninfo —  which device, and what materials from it —  are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think \norganizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. \nWe're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful —  and thanks everybody for the assistance. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n212.637.2415 \nEFTA00032146",
