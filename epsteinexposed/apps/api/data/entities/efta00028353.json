Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 — victims' rights re: bail hearing \nDate: Thu, 11 Jul 2019 \n01:00:07 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nSid, \nAs you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has \nthe right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving \nrelease. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's \nrights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a \nsubmission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no \nrequirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. \nTo the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that we expect to vigorously oppose bail, as we \nindicated to the judge we would in the proceedings earlier this week. \nPlease let me know if you'd like to discuss, no problem either way, and thanks as always. \nM \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028353",
