    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \"Acosta, Alex USAFLS)\" <AAcosta@usa.do'. ov>, \nBcc \nSubject: FW: Jeffrey Epstein \nAgreement \nDate: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 22:35:12 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nAttachments: Epstein_Agnnt001.pdf \nHi everyone —  I still haven't heard from Roy, but in the meantime, I  have been looking for correspondence that \ncould be described as an assent to the modification in the December letter. \nFirst, as set forth below, prior to the change of plea, we informed Epstein's counsel that we took the position that \nwe already have a binding agreement and that nothing further was required. (This was a June 24 e-mail) \nDear Roy and Jack: \nI am just writing to re-state that it is the Government's position that we have a signed, binding agreement and \nthat there is no need for further modification. \nPlease keep us informed of the date and time of the change of plea and sentencing. \nThank you. \nWe took the same position in the e-mails thatIlland I sent to Jay Lefkowitz notifying him of Epstein's need to \npromptly perform their obligations following the various DOJ decisions. This was the language we used: \nDear Mr. Lefkowitz: \nI understand that the Deputy Attorney General has completed his review of the Epstein matter and has \ndetermined that federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein's case is appropriate. \nAccordingly, Mr. Epstein has until the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the agreement between the United States and Mr. Epstein (as modified by the U.S. Attorney's \nDecember 19th letter to Ms. MCI, including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to begin his \nsentence of imprisonment. \nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the number shown below. \n(This was sent on June 23rd to Jay and June 24th to Roy.) Following this correspondence, Epstein entered his \nguilty plea. \nOn June \n30th, a couple of hours after the change of plea, the agents and I went to Jack Goldberger's office and \nmet with Jack and Mike Tein. We provided them with the proposed Notification of Identified Victims. On the \nfirst page of that notice, we wrote the following: \nIn light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United \nStates has agreed to defer federal \nprosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to \ncertain conditions. \nOne such \ncondition to which Epstein has agreed is the following: \nEFTA00013923\n\n\"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in \nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under \nSection \n2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and \nconvicted of \nan enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the \nUnited States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was \nprepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. \nAny judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining \nwhich evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent \nof the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have \nbeen had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no \nless.\" \nOn July 9, 2008, Jack Goldberger wrote me a letter with some objections to the Proposed Notification. Although \nhe had several requests for changes, he stated: \"Rather, a simple one page notification directed only to the \nrecipient, and limited to the information currently on the first page of your draft memorandum would suffice.\" \nThis, to me, is a written assent that the quoted language is, in fact, one of the conditions to which Epstein has \nagreed. So, I  think that we do have a written, binding agreement comprised of the three documents that, as far as \nI know, were filed with the state court with Jack Goldberger's approval. (I am waiting to hear back from the \nASA.) \nHere again is what I provided to the State Attorney's \nOffice, for your records. \n<<Epstein Agrmt001.pdf>> \nI am concerned that we were adamant before Epstein's plea that we had a complete agreement and nothing more \nwas necessary and now taking the position that we do not have an operative document (or set of documents). \ndoes the Black and Goldberger correspondence described above allay your concerns? Or would you still \nlike me to raise this issue with Roy whenever he gets back to me? \nThank you, sorry for the lengthy e-mail. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nPhone \nFax \nFrom:  \nSent: uesday, June 24, 2008 4:05 PM \nTo: 'Roy BLACK'; 'Jack Goldberger' \nCc \nSubject: Jeffrey Epstein Agreement \nDear Roy and Jack: \nI am just writing to re-state that it is the Government's position that we have a signed, binding agreement and \nthat there is no need for further modification. \nEFTA00013924\n\nPlease keep us \ninformed of \nthe date and \ntime of the change \nof plea and \nsentencing. \nThank you. \nAssistant \nU.S. Attorney \nPhone \nFax \nEFTA00013925",
