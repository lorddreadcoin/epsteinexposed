The officers \ntold me to use the larger, corner room. \n> Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied \nbecause the officers' claim \n> the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and \neasily positioned the camera focused on the corner room. \n> I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the \nlarger corner \nroom. \n> The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. \n> Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the \nfacility. See tracking information below. \n> Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell \nwill receive these \ndeliveries. \n> \nThank \nyou-\n> Bobbi \n> <Screen Shot \n2021-10-25 at 7.10.13 PM.png> \n> <Screen \nShot 2021-10-25 at 7.07.56 PM.png> \n> Please note my new office address and preferred email address: \n> BOBBI C.
