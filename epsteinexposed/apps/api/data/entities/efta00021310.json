    "text": "\n\nFrom: ' (NY) (FBI)\" a \nTo: \n(NY) (FBI)\" \nSubject: New York search warrant materials \nDate: Mon, 30 Sep 2019 19:13:05 +0000 \nHey, \nI've copied here who has handled all of the Epstein evidence that was sent to CART. He should be \nable to answer your questions regarding what he's processed. \nOn Sep 30, 2019 1:57 \nPM, \"\n)\" \nwrote: \nThe taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents \nthan we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, \nhard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and \nsent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding \nwas that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 38 computers and/or \nelectronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021310",
