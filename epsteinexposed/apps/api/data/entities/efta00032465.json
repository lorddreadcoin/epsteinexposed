Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential \nmaterials, scenes \nDate: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 21:35:30 +0000 \nInline-Images: image001.jpg \nThank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. \n•  For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the \nexception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal \nto inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic \ndevices and \"fragile\" items. \no  Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate \ninspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos \nof these same items are insufficient. \no  If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 \nwhich those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to \ninspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you \nconsider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. \no  Please let us know when these \"non-transportable\" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx \nwarehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the \nCourt. \n•  For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and \nseek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that \ncontain \"witness statements\" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the \noutside of those recordings. \n•  As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It \nis my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked \ncourtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time \nfor inspection. \n•  We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and \nappreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). \n•  We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously \ndisclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be \navailable for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. \n•  We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl \nStreet. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as \nscheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment. \nLaura A.

Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes \n> \nCounsel, \nThank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with \narranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will \nalso arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. \nPhysical \nEvidence \n•  It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are \ncertainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the \npreparation of her defense. \n•  We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: \no  We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics \nof transport. \no  We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. \nThose are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. \no  The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from \nJeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 \nproductions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was \nseized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very \ncumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. \no  The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult \nto transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs \nfrom the searches of Epstein's residences. \no  Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These \ninclude plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided \nto you from the search of the New York residence. \n•  The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it \nwould be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. \n•  Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette \nplayer, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these \nrecordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other \nequipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our \nunderstanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been \nproduced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were \nnot produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, \nwe are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings \nthat have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. \nEFTA00032466\n\n•  The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to \nconfirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. \n•  We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence \nreview or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence \ncannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and \nthe defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. \n•  As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an \nAUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside \nof the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the \nproffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of \nthe defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how \nwe might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the \ndefense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our \nconsent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. \nHighly Confidential Electronic Images \n•  The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from \nJeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the \ncover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, \nthat \"the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the \nabove-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these \nimages available for review by the defense upon request.\" We did not receive a request from the defense to review \nthese images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to \"view and inspect all materials designated by your \noffice as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order\". \n•  We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to \nbe requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the \ndefense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs \nfrom Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Laura Men ninger \n<imenninger@hmflaw.com>\nSent: Monday, March 22, 2021 5:19 PM \nTo: \n) ; ) \n(USANYS) \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliucaPhmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>; 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com>\nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes \nAll, \nEFTA00032467\n\nWe have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the \ncase and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. \nFirst, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices \nwhich are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the \nphysical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. \nSecond, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her \nown defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by \nwhich she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. \nIn order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: \nPhysical \nEvidence \n•  All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street \nand made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to \naccommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. \no  We do not need the \"bulky\" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence \npieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and \nphotograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. \no  From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse —  both envelopes \nwith cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two \"cash\" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. \no  If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are \nand where they are. \n•  We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission \nfrom Judge Nathan to do so. \n•  Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can \nbring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats \nof each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by \nMarch 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. \n•  The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem \"highly confidential.\" You can identify any \"highly \nconfidential\" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If \nwe need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, \nwe will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence \nreview proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item \nbasis. \n•  The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence \nview the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek \nleave of the Court in advance. \n•  We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl \nStreet but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a \nseparate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the \ngovernment. \n•  Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described \nbelow) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the \ndiscovery deadlines last fall and why. \nHighly Confidential \nElectronic Evidence \n•  Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 \"highly confidential\" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our \nunderstanding that you previously provided all \"highly confidential\" images to our client —  and to defense counsel —\nfor review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were \nlocated and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. \n•  During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a \ndefense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked \"highly \nEFTA00032468\n\nconfidential\". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, \npreviously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). \nPlease let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. \nThank you. \nLaura A.

'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' \n<bcsternheim@mac.com>\nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes \nAll, \nAttached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding \ndiscovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. \nIn response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: \nRegarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: \n•  There are three categories of these images: \no  Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not \nbeen previously provided to you) \no  Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have \npreviously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) \no  Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of \nEpstein (which have not been previously provided to you) \n•  The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, \nand the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. \no  All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must \nbe viewed using Cellebrite. \no  The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple \ndevices. \no  The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each \nimage. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all \nother images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. \no  The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder \nto indicate which device each image was seized from. \n•  Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and \nthere is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able \nto provide a  single laptop for review of these images. \nRegarding the physical evidence: \n•  Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items \nassociated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the \nFBI New York office's current investigation. \nEFTA00032469\n\n•  The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two \nitems (1B 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 \nFederal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that \nyou will have all evidence in one place. \n•  The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the \nfollowing conditions: \no  The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and \nplace them in a location where a large group of people can view them. \no  The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. \no  At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. \no  The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. \nTo ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend \nto be physically present for this review. \no  Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team \nmay bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If \nthe defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who \nare present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the \npresence of nudity. \no  Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. \n•  To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, \nthe FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large \nitems, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed \nHighly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if \nnecessary. \n•  The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a \nsingle location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media \nthat does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI \nanticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in \ndowntown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. \no  To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's \nresidences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For \nyour awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on \nall of those discs. \nPlease let me know how you wish to proceed. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 15, 2021 6:00 PM \nTo: 'Laura Menninger' <Imenningehmflaw.com>•\n(USANYS) \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliucaPhmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser com) \nEFTA00032470\n\n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>.
