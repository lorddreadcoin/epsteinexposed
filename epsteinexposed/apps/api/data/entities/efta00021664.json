Those \nremoval memos have been placed in the Epstein Accounts Document folder as well. \nIf you have any questions, please call me. \nThanks \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 7, 2021 12:57 PM \nTo: (NY) \n(FBI) < \nCc: (USANYS) < \nSubject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - RE: Epstein Account Documents \nThanks!
