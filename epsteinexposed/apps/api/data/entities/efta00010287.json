Any video file can be opened with VLC, which has been included. \n3. Accessory files (i.e. .dii, .ami, .cms, etc.) are to be ignored, as they serve no functional \npurpose besides assisting in the operation of other (i.e. video) files. \n4. Any previously flagged files that are not noted here have been converted to PDFs and/or \nhad their file paths shortened to enable viewing. \nThe Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly \nproduce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware.
