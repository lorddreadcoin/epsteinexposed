Separately, though will we be able to play those video files *not* \non a DVD? That is, we only have them in electronic format (in the file folders) —  I haven't tried to play them, so maybe it's \njust as easy as that, but wanted to check if we need to get them processed in some other fashion to be able to view \nindependently of a DVD player. \nthanks, \nFrom: I \nSent: Tuesday, March 26, 2019 09:32 \nTo: \nCc:\nSubject: RE: documents for Relativity \nGood Morning = \nI have noticed that some of these documents contain data that appears to be from a DVD.
