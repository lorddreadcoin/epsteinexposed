And I didn't see any other normal / decent business hotels in that area that were \nwithin our per diem (with the possible exception of the Le Meridien). \nHowever, for the first time in any of the trips we've ever been out there, the Beverly Hilton is listed within our per diem \n($181 for the AUSAs), and it's less than a  ten minute drive from both attorney's office and attorney's \noffice (and we could of course get a conference room there for ).  It's not the fanciest hotel in the world, but it's a \nnormal Hilton, the location is perfect, and no drilling (I), so I went for it and wanted to recommend it and let everybody \nknow. No worries if people prefer elsewhere, but it's an option. \nEFTA00014385\n\nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, February 13, 2020 01:15 \nTo: \nCc: \n/ 1\nSubject: FW: travel approval request \nMS just FYI, in connection with this trip to Los Angeles, I just made a reservation for a  hotel on E2 (see attached) —\nif I \ndid anything wrong, it can be changed, but it's a hotel that is almost never available for us so I wanted to make the \nreservation tonight just in case. And will follow up with flights in the coming days. Happy to chat if that's useful, and \nthanks very much. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, February 12, 2020 22:55 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nApproved \nSent from my iPad \nOn Feb 12, 2020, at 9:14 PM, \nS \nC \nwrote: \nSimilar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request \npermission for the team to travel next week for three interviews in Los Angeles on February 26, 27, and 28 (we have at \nleast one interview on each of those days). We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 25th to \nthe 29th. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those dates (the \n26th). \nthank you, \n<mime-attachment> \nEFTA00014386",
