Please let us know if you have any edits —  we'll check for accuracy on our end as well, \nbut we wanted to circulate so that we could all check at the same time. Please note that, for three jurors, we've \nwithdrawn our objection and joined your position that those jurors should proceed to voir dire. Those juror numbers are: \n127, 151, and 458. \nThanks, \nMenninger \nNovember 7  2021 3:03 PM \nAnn Lundberg \nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL] RE: questionnaires \nSorry Mut we did not use Excel to prepare our list, so I don't know how to convert it.

We're happy to take on \nthe task of compiling data for our joint submission. To that end, could you please email us your list of strikes by noon \ntomorrow? Once we receive your list, we will compile that data into a letter outlining the four categories of juror \nnumbers the Court has requested, and we'll send that back to you so that you can double check the accuracy of the \nchart. We estimate that process will take a fair amount of time, which is why we'll need your data by noon tomorrow if \nyou'd like us to coordinate the process. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00018895",
