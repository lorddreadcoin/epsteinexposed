In \nadvance of the trip, I'm going to begin drafting q&as, and it would be super helpful to have a binder with some \ninformation about two of the witnesses. When you can, could someone please put together a binder with all witness \ninterview notes and 302s for the following two witnesses? Thanks so much. No labels on the binders needed — just tabs \nwith dates of interviews would be great (e.g., M., 7-6-19 interview). \n• \n• \nThese materials should be in their 3500 folders. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00032476",
