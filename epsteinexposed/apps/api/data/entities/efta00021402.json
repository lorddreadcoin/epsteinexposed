Sorry to bug you while you may be working on a bail reply. \nI'm having trouble reaching Agen to coordinate pickup of the cellphone and other items seized upon Epstein's \narrest. She said she'd be out in the field, but I don't hear from the intermediary agent — identity unknown — who was \nsupposed to handle it in her absence. Can you step in and try to move this along? \nThanks a lot. \nEFTA00021402\n\nMarc Fernich, Esq. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jul 9, 2019, at 3:26 PM, wrote: \nMarc, \nIt is the right number, so feel free to follow up later, but I can also give you her cell number which \nthanks, \nFrom: Marc Fernich < \nSent: Tuesday, July 09, 2019 14:56 \nTo: \nCc: Marty \nWeinberg \nSubject: Re: U.S. v.

The best way to coordinate this is to contact the case \nagent directly — I just spoke to her so she'll be expecting your call. They're running around, so if you reach out and \naren't able to connect today please let me know, but hopefully we can get it coordinated.
