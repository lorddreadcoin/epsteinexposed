Since I'm not sure exactly where we'll be in the morning, and I don't want to delay you at all in the morning, \nit mike make sense to just drop them at the security tent at our office, which is next door.

I should be able to bring them in, \nbut maybe it's better to have a paralegal meet me in front of the side entrance of 40 Foley at 8:30am.
