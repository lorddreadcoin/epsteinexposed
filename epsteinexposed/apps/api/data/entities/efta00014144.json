Australian Ave, Ste 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \n(561) 820-8711 \nFacsimile: (561) 820-8777 \nAugust 26, 2008 \nDELIVERY BY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nJay P. Lefkowitz, Esq. \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nCitigroup Center \n153 East \n53rd Street \nNew York, New York 10022-4675 \nRoy Black, Esq. \nBlack Srebnick Kornspan & Stumpf P.A. \n201 S. Biscayne Blvd, Suite 1300 \nMiami, FL 33131 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Jay and Roy: \nThank you for your letter of August 22nd. I write to follow up on some of the points that \nyou raised. \nThe list of thirty-two victims that was provided to Mr. Goldberger via certified mail on \nJuly 10, 2008 is the final list. As I mentioned, copies of the notification letters to each victim will \nbe carbon-copied to an attorney for Mr. Epstein and \nMr. Josefsberg. I  asked you to advise me \nwhether Mr. \nGoldberger should continue to be listed as the contact person for the civil litigation \nin the amended victim notification letters and whether he \nshould receive the carbon copies of \nthose \nletters as they are sent. \nI  also \nasked you to provide me with written confirmation of your agreement to pay Mr. \nJosefsberg's fees. Please \nprovide me with that confirmation so that Mr. Josefsberg can begin his \nrepresentation. \nI have conferred with the lead AUSA in the case of Jane Doe 1 and 2 v.  United States , and \nhe agrees that, based \nupon the discussion with Judge Marra during the hearing on the plaintiffs' \nmotion, a  notification of the judge's ruling is required. I  will, however, change the language \nslightly to direct the victims to discuss the matter with Mr. Josefsberg. \nWith regard to your concerns with my \"open-ended description of Mr. Epstein's \nresponsibilities regarding civil restitution,\" I  agree that the resolution of civil damages claims is \nas stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Agreement and Addendum. That is why the language in the \nnotification is taken verbatim from paragraphs 7, 8, and 7C of the Agreement \nand Addendum, \nexcept that the victim's name is used in place of \"identified individual.\" As I  mentioned in my \nearlier letter, if you have any proposed substantive changes, please \nprovide them to me. \nMr. Goldberger and Mr. Tein explicitly approved the language in my earlier victim \nnotification letter, even though they apparently were taking the position that the December 19, \n2007 letter was not part of the Agreement, so that misinformation was provided to the victims \nwith the approval of Mr. Epstein's \nattorneys. \nWith regard to your sixth and seventh points, I  reiterate that it is the Office's position that \nthe Agreement and Addendum speak for themselves. Let me also reiterate that, while the Office \ndoes not intend to involve itself in any civil negotiations or litigation, if it comes to our attention \nEFTA00014144\n\nthat Mr. Epstein has breached the terms of the Agreement, the Office intends to enforce its right \nto indict Mr. Epstein. \nI  would appreciate a  prompt response to the question regarding which of Mr. Epstein's \nattorneys should be named \nin and receive copies of the notification letters, as well as \ndocumentation of your commitment to paying Mr. Josefsberg's fees so that I  may begin \ndistributing the revised victim notifications on Wednesday morning. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander \nAcosta \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States \nAttorney \ncc: \n, Chief, Northern Division \nEFTA00014145",
