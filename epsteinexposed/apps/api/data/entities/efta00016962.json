She is the First Assistant who would likely have the \nauthority to issue the letter authorizing SDNY access to grand jury materials our office developed. \nFrom: \nSent: werinesday.

SDNY has an open criminal matter involving Jeff \nEpstein. They understand we are recused and have shared nothing about the matter. The \npurpose of the call concerned their efforts to obtain from the FBI in the SDFL the evidence \ngathered as part of the SDFL Epstein investigation. The Miami FBI has expressed a reluctance to \nsend any 6e materials to the SDNY FBI without a 6e letter. Given our recusal from the \nunderlying criminal matter, I don't believe we should be the ones to give the FBI the go-ahead \nor the 6e letter. We no longer control that evidence. \nDo you have the name and contact information for the new USAO/AUSA handling our old \ncriminal case? I think the best bet is to put SDNY in touch with that AUSA. \nThanks \nEFTA00016963",
