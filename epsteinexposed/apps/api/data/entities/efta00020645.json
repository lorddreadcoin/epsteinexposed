Upon my arrival I was \ninformed that an inmate \nhad \nattempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed \ninmate \nEpstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal \nposition on the floor of his cell wearing a \nt\n-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was \nsnoring. I called out to inmate \nEpstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His \nneck was red \nwith no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to \nhis person. An attempt was made \nto get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in \nhand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the \nstretcher. As inmate Epstein was \nbeing placed on the stretcher \nby responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe \nstaff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would \nhurriedly shut his eyes. The \ninmate was \ntaken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide \nwatch. While awaiting the arrival of an \ninmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the \nedge of the bed and began moving \nforward as if he was attempting to fall over head \nfirst. When I looked away, he \nstraightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he \nattempted the same \nact. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his \naction or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. \nAt that moment, he stated, \n\"Okay, I won't do it again,\" and gave the thumbs up. \nBecause of his unpredictable \nbehavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I \nleft HA-Unit in order to make staff \nnotifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer \nwho stated that inmate Epstein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, \nartaglione, \nNicholas #78514-054 had attempted to \nkill him and had \nbeen \nharassing \nhim. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this \nmatter. \nI photographed and spoke with \ninmate Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 who stated \nthat he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and \nsaid, \"Jeff, what you're doing?\" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and \nsaw him with a string \naround his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and \nASettsitive Limited Official Use Onlyz \nEFTA00020645\n\ne\n'' \nfa% \n, \nV \nEFTA00020646\n\nthey ran down. Upon \nf...ner questioning, \ninmate Tartaglione ...tated \nthat he \nsleeps on \nthe bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate \nEpstein because he's old. He stated that he \nsleeps on the floor on a \nmattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't \nremember if he sat up or \nstood up to check on Epstein. He stated that \nEpstein was \nsitting on the floor leaning to the \nside with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He \nstated that \nthe last time he saw him he was \nsnoring really loud. \nInmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. \n8:00PM and staff \nhanded him a copy of the Daily News. \n\"Nick\" was on the floor reading the Daily News. \nHe stated that he had given it to him. He stated that \nTartaglione mentioned that he'd \nbeen in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, \ninmate \nTartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and \nstated that \nTartaglione \nstated, \"These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could \nreport it. (Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker.\" He then turned to a page in \nthe Daily \nNews that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy \nseven million dollars. Epstein \nstated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in \nthe garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated \nthat at approx. 1:00 \nAM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every \nthirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there \nin his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we \nwere calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself \nmaking a \nnoise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated \nthat he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. \nDuty \nmedical, Dr. was notified and briefed. It was \ndetermined no further \nmedical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time \nof this incident, \ndue to the fact, there was no \nmedical \nstaff available after 10:00 PM. \ne \narrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP \nfor a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on \nthe front \nwith marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee. \nASensitive Limited Official Use Only= \nEFTA00020647\n\neS fill\n, \nEFTA00020648\n\nUNITED \nSTATES GOVERNMENT \nMEMORANDUM \nMetropolitan Correctional \nCenter, New York, New York \nDATE: 07 \nTO: Ops \nLT. \nFROM: S/O/S \nSUBJECT: Suicide Attempt \nInmate \nEpstein#76318-054 \nOn the \nabove date at \napprox.
