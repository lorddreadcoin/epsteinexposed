In parallel, we are considering filing civil forfeiture actions against Epstein \nproperties used by Epstein and Maxwell to facilitate their criminal conduct, which are \ncollectively worth in excess of $100 million. \nEpstein is alleged to have engaged in a years-long pattern of enticing minor girls to \nengage in sex acts, aided and abetted and facilitated by Maxwell. Epstein undertook this conduct \nin at least New York, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and certain cities abroad. \nWe estimate that there are at least 50 victims who were abused by Epstein in New York, \nFlorida and elsewhere, and who currently live throughout the United States and abroad, and \nseveral whose abuse was facilitated by Maxwell. Significant investigative costs include \nsignificant travel to interview victims and witnesses, and data hosting and discovery support \nrelating from voluminous records obtained from dozens of devices obtained via search warrants, \namong other \ndiscovery costs. \nPage 2 of 2 \nExecutive we or United States Attorneys \nWashington, DC 20530 \nEFTA00025190",
