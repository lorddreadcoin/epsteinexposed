Epstein call \nDate: Sun, 25 Aug 2019 19:04:28 +0000 \nMarty, \nFollowing up on our conversation last week, are you able to share with us your thoughts on whether the defense \nintends to address the Court beyond noting that there is no objection to the dismissal? \nSeparately, if you could please let us know the status of the return of discovery materials, we would appreciate it. \nWe are hopping to be able to tell the Court on Tuesday that this issue is resolved. \nThanks, \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 22, 2019, at 12:09 PM, \nMarty, \n)< \n>  wrote: \nI got your voicemail from this morning regarding follow-up on civil forfeiture—we have a meeting at 12:30 that I expect \nwill go approximately 15 minutes and will plan to give you (or Mike, to conference you in) a call after that, so \napproximately around 12:45 — 1:00. \nSeparately, based on the expected nolle order, and in connection with the protective order in this case, in advance of the \nhearing on Tuesday can you please either return to the Government all discovery you received in this case and certify \nthat any copies have been security destroyed or deleted, or, alternatively, simply certify that all discovery received has \nbeen security destroyed or deleted? (As to the second option, that is to say that you do not need to make additional \ncopies of electronic materials to formally \"return\" them to us if it is more efficient to simply delete and destroy the \nexisting electronic copies you have.) We want to be able to advise the Court on Tuesday that there are no outstanding \ndiscovery obligations on either side based in connection with the protective order. \nThank you, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00029728",
