August 15. 2019 4:34 PM \nTo:\nSubject: Metropolitan Correctional Center 'accidentally released' serial bank robber days before Epstein's death \nMetropolitan Correctional Center 'accidentally released' serial bank robber days before Epstein's death \nFox \nNews \nBy \nNicole Darrah \n8/15/19 \nA serial bank robber awaiting sentencing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was \"accidentally \nreleased\" from federal custody just days before a series of ignored \nprotocols gave Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity \nfor his apparent suicide. \nMichael Matthews, 58, was told Aug 7 he was free to leave the New York facility which, in recent days, has come \nunder fire after Epstein, 66, died from an apparent suicide after being left alone in his cell for hours on Saturday —\ndespite recently being on suicide watch, and despite protocol requiring otherwise. \nMatthews' family told the New York Daily News that a counselor at MCC invited him to their office, where he was \ngiven a card to ride the subway and paperwork to sign to be released. lie knew \nhe was awaiting sentencing, \nscheduled for Sept \n20, but didn't speak up. \nRichard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, stated in a letter obtained by Fox News on \nThursday that Matthews — who previously served \ntime for bank robbery — was released, despite being held \n\"pursuant to a permanent order of \ndetention.\" \nEFTA00019402\n\nHe explains that Matthews was arrested in January after he failed to appear at a halfway house in Brooklyn after \nbeing released from a federal facility in New Jersey. He \nwas charged with escaping custody, and was also charged in \nthree bank robberies during the time he \nwas supposed to be in the halfway house, according to prosecutors. \n\"The government is currently seeking additional information about the circumstances prompting the defendant's \npre-sentencing release, and sets forth below those \nfacts that the government has confirmed to date,\" Donoghue \nwrote. \nWhile Matthews surrendered to officials Aug 12, his release further contributes to the scrutiny surrounding the \nMMC — which houses some of the highest-security inmates in the U.S. - following Epstein's death. \nAttorney General William Barr vowed on Monday a full investigation into the federal prison. He said he was \n\"appalled... and frankly, angry to learn of MCC's failure to adequately \nsecure this prisoner.\" \n\"We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough \ninvestigation.\" \nEpstein, who was found with bruising on his neck in his cell last month, had been taken off suicide watch shortly \nbefore his death, according to a source familiar with the matter. Per protocol, the 66-year-old \nshould've been \nchecked on every 30 minutes, but before his death had not been physically checked on for \"several hours.\" \nAdditionally, he didn't have a cellmate on the night of his death. \nA lawyer for one of Epstein's former cellmates, Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer in New York who \nwas charged in 2016 with the deaths of four men stemming from an \nalleged cocaine conspiracy, told Fox News \nearlier this week he's had several clients who have been locked up both in New York City's notorious Rikers Island \njail and MCC, and claimed many have said they \"would rather be at \nBikers.\" \n\"That \ngives you some idea how bad the place is,\" the lawyer, Bruce Barket said. \"At the end of the day, the facility \nis run with a bad combination of laziness and cruelty and this is \none of the results.\" \nHe described conditions at MCC \"border \non inhumane,\" and said one day, when Tartaglione woke up, he \ndiscovered that while sleeping \nhe'd rolled onto a rodent, smothering it. \nSeparately, a \nrepresentative from the \nAmerican Federation of \nGovernment \nEmployees/Council of Prison Locals \ndecried the low staff levels at MCC, but also said the issue \nis a \"system-wide crisis in our prison system.\" \nEFTA00019403",
