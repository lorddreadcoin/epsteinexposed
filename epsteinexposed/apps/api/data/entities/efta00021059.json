Maybe tomorrow? I have time in the afternoon. \nFrom: \nSent: nday, January 31, 2020 1:09 PM \nTo \nSubject: RE: Epstein -- travel approval form \nTotally understand, and next week would be fine — let me know if it's helpful to set a time, and otherwise I'll touch base \nmidweek if we haven't connected by then. \nAnd thanks very much re: the memo. \nFrom: \nSent: Frida , Janua \nTo: \nCc: \nSubje : :   ps ein -- rave approva orm \n31, 2020 12:53 \nAlready signed and sent upstairs . . . . I will do my best to ensure signature immediately. \nRe: this afternoon: it may be best to kick it to next week.

Thank you! \nAnd separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if that's \neasier. \nthanks \nagain, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021060",
