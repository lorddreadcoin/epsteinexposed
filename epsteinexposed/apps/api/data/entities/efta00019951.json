It represents all the \ninformation we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get additional \ninformation we will pass it along immediately. \nSeparately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are accurate, and I \nfully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. \nAs always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful. \nthank you, \nEFTA00019951",
