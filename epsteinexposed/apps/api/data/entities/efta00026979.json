In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of \ninformation we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any \ndevice that there is more than one of the same thing.

We're not able to get web-enabled access \nthrough any FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on \nRelativity, which both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can \nproduce them to defense counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My \nunderstanding from is that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original \nfiles, which our vendor will process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto \nRelativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our \nsystems for discovery purposes. \nAnd we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents \nearlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. \nAgain, I understand from that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original \nformats, which I understand will be segregated and designated by device.

You are taking \nfiles that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) \nto do a taint review. \nRelativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a \ncomputer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you \ninsisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top \nof what was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything.

Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? \nThe excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we \nsent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you \nmean by \"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're \nreferring to as \"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been \ntransferred, or just partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see \nthe attached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. \nNot only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents \nto defense counsel. \nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have \nthe native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it \neffectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \nRelated, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of \nnumbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual \nlarge file in the native files, it would be impossible. \nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need \nto get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more \nthan a million documents without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary \nrecord-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also \nattaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if \nthat's useful. \nthanks, \nFrom: (NY) (FBI) <M> \nSent: Wednesday, March 04, 2020 16:36 \nTo: (USANYS) ca; \nCc: \n(NY) (FBI) le (USANYS) \n< \n(USANYS) [Contractor] <I:>; \n) \n(NY) (FBI) \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nHere is a  listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review.

I can say, off the top \nof my head, that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose \nmedia. The CDs from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY \nthat need to be produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the \"kitchen\" mac \nhas been produced.

We didn't hear back on \nwhich files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the \nmaterials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., \nEFTA00026995\n\nwhich devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, \netc. \nBased on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are \napproximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even \ncounting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, \nincluding multiple servers / server racks. \nSo we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of \nmoving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming \nweek from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be \nplenty of time to schedule a productive meeting. \nthanks all, \nIM• \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, February 15, 2020 16:30 \nTo: \n. \n(NY) (FBI) < >; \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \n< \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(NY) \n(FBI) <> \nI'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it —  I have \nthe hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also \nold materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's \nnew. \nJust generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of \nwhat we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with \na list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. \nSo for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled \"loadFiles\" through \"37loadFiles\" with a \nmodified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received —  but I'm not sure, because we \nhaven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled \n\"NYC024362\" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously \nreceived? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. \nI don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the \nfolder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it \nin addition to what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we \nreally need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying \nthat same info —  which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise \nI think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. \nWe're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nEFTA00026996\n\nSouthern \nDistrict of New York \n<mime\n-attachment> \nEFTA00026997",
