I don't know who the FOIA request is directed to —  whether it's just to our office or \nto FBI or DOJ as a whole. I think the office's practice on this case is to forward all FOIA inquiries to who is \nhandling them as the main point of contact. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jul 22, 2020, at 4:46 PM, wrote: \nIsn't the answer just that we don't even have it? \nRelated, I just put in an intake form request (apologies if someone already did), for discovery production . . . \nFrom: (USAEO) \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 16:08 \nTo: \n>; \nita \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: FOIA Request for Ghislaine Maxwell's Mugshot \nand \nGood afternoon.
