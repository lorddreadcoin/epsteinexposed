I understand the prosecution team has been walled off from the investigation. Do you have access to his \nrecords from his prior incarceration? If not do you have a  contact for his prior facility or the USAO in Florida? I have been \nasked to track down certain documentation in reference thereto in relation to the various investigations into the incident this \npast weekend. \nThank you, \nSupervisory Staff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetropolitan Correctional Center \nEFTA00032292",
