Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed as an \nadmission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional \nor other defense as to any person whose name does not appear on the \nlist provided by \nthe United States. \n10. Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under \n18 U.S.C. § 2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's \nsignature on this \nagreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or \nsettlements by Epstein are to be construed as admissions or evidence of \ncivil or criminal liability or a \nwaiver of any jurisdictional or other \ndefense as to any person, whether or not her name appears on the list \nprovided by \nthe United \nStates. \n11. \nEpstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be \nPage 4 of 7 \nEFTA00013683\n\n• \nsentenced not later than October 26, 2007.

At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to provide an \naccounting of the gain time he earned during his period of \nincarceration. \n13. The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any \npublic record. If the \nUnited States receives a Freedom of Information \nAct request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of \nthe agreement, it  will provide \nnotice to \nEpstein \nbefore making that \ndisclosure. \nEpstein understands \nthat the United States Attorney has no \nauthority to require the \nState Attorney's \nOffice to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein undcrstands that \nit  is his obligation \nto \nundertake discussions with the State \nAttorney's Office and to use his \nbest \nefforts to \nensure \ncompliance with these \nprocedures, \nwhich \ncompliance will be necessary \nto \nsatisfy \nthe United \nStates' interest. Epstein also understands \nthat it is his \nobligation to use \nhis \nbest \nefforts to \nconvince the Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit to \naccept Epstein's binding \nre\ncommendation regarding \nthe sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to \ndo so will \nbe a breach of the \nagreement. \nIn consideration \nof Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to \nprovide compensation \nin the \nmanner \ndescribed above, if Epstein successfully \nfulfills all of the terms and conditions \nof \nthis \nagreement, the United \nStates also agrees \nthat it will not institute any \ncriminal ch es \na  ainst an \notential co-cons irators of E stein including but not limited to \no \nFurther, upon execution of \nthis \nagreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury \ninvestigation \nwill be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury \nsubpoenas will be held \nin abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement. The \ndefendant likewise \nagrees to withdraw his pending motion \nto intervene and to quash certain \ngrand jury subpoenas. Both parties agree to maintain their evidence, specifically evidence \nrequested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued, and \nincluding certain computer \nequipment, inviolate until all of the terms of this agreement have \nbeen satisfied. \nUpon the \nsuccessful \ncompletion of the \nterms of this agreement, all \noutstanding \ngrand jury subpoenas shall be deemed withdrawn. \nPage \n5 of 7 \n• \nEFTA00013684\n\n• \nBy signing this \nagreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each \nof these terms is \nmaterial to this agreement and is supported by independent \nconsideration and that a breach \nof any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate \nthe agreement \nand to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all \nfederal \noffenses. \n• \n• \nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of \nthe \nfact that \nthe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal \nprosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further \nis \naware \nthat Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure \nprovides that \nthe Court \nmay dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting \na charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein \nhereby requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District ofFlorida defer such \nprosecution. Epstein agrees and consents \nthat any delay from the date of this Agreement to \nthe date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be \ndeemed to \nbe a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any \ndefense to \nsuch \nprosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of \nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute \nof limitations \nfor a  period of months equal to the period \nbetween the signing of this \nagreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the \ngrand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that \nthe \nFifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all \nfelonies must be \ncharged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees \nand consents that, if a  prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the \nsubject of the \ngrand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and \nfiled \nby the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as \nto \nany such \noffense. \n/// \n/// \n/// \nPage 6 of 7 \nEFTA00013685\n\n• \nBy \nsigning this agreement, Epstein \nasserts and \ncertifies \nthat \nthe above has been read \nand explained to him. \nEpstein hereby \nstates \nthat he \nunderstands \nthe conditions of this Non-\nProsecution Agreement \nand agrees to comply \nwith them. \nIL \nALEXANDER ACOSTA \nUNITED \nSTATES ATTORNEY \nDated:  \nBy: \nDated: \n7/P/9-\nDated: \n• \nDated: \n• \nASSISTANT \nU.S. ATTORNEY \nGERALD \nLEFCOURT, ESQ. \nCOUNSEL TO JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN \nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, \nESQ. \nATTORNEY FOR JEFFREY EPSTEIN \nPage 7 of \n7 \nii \nEFTA00013686\n\n• \nBy \nsigning \nthis \nagreement, \nEpstein \nasserts and \ncertifies \nthat the above has been \nread \nand \nexplained \nto him. \nEpstein hereby states that he \nunderstands \nthe \nconditions of this Non-\nProsecution \nAgreement and agrees \nto comply \nwith them. \nR. \nALEXANDER ACOSTA \nUNITED \nSTATES ATTORNEY \nDated: \nBy: \nASSISTANT U.S. \nATTORNEY \n• \n• \nDated: \nDated: \nDated: \n7 \nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, ESQ. \nATTORNEY FOR \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN \nPage 7 of 7 \nEFTA00013687\n\n• \nBy \nsigning \nthis \nagreement, Epstein asserts \nand certifies that the above has been \nread \nand \nexplained to him.
