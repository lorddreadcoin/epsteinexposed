The warden has approved our request to give the defendant this \nlaptop, and we would like to have it ready by the end of the week if at all possible. If you have any questions, I \ncan \nbe reached at anytime today. Thanks so much for your help with this project. \nBest, \nSent from my iPhone \nOn \nOct 28, 2020, at 2:44 PM, (USANYS)  \n> \nwrote: \nIt sure we will research one tonight and place the order tomorrow. It depends on availability and delivery. Do \nwe have a copy of the data that goes with the drive? \nAlso with the ever changing policies in BOP, can you confirm that they will allow her to have a laptop. Not \nsure the rules at MDC. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn \nOct 28, 2020, at 2:22 PM, \n)1 \nPerfect, thanks so much.

Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we \nwould like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit \nreview of standard files —  word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we \ndid something similar in the Avenatti case, and I= like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a \nhuge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. \nThanks so much—\nEFTA00030527",
