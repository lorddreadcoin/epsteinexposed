New York 10007 \nMay 14, 2021 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe parties respectfully and jointly write to request an extension of time to file a letter in \nresponse to the Court's Order of May 11, 2021, requiring the parties to submit a  joint letter \nregarding the overall pretrial schedule. (Dkt. No. 277). The joint letter is currently due on May \n14, 2021, and the parties respectfully request an extension to May 21, 2021. No previous requests \nfor an extension of this deadline have been made. \nEFTA00014636\n\nPage 2 \nThe parties seek this extension in order to permit continuation of productive discussions \nthat the parties have already initiated regarding the pretrial schedule. The parties conferred \nyesterday for approximately 45 minutes by telephone on that topic. Although the conversation \nwas productive, there remain multiple points of disagreement. The requested extension will permit \nthe parties to consider each other's proposals as to certain deadlines, and to further confer with the \naim of minimizing the points of disagreement that will need to be resolved by the Court. \nRespectfully submitted, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  s/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nCc: Defense counsel \n(By ECF) \nEFTA00014637",
