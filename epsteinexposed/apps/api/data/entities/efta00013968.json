    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: pstein \nase \nDate: Thu, 19 Jun 2008 20:44:52 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nDear= \nI just wanted to let you know that and I spoke with Roy Black yesterday regarding the Epstein case. Roy \nasked whether there was a way to resolve the federal and state litigation simultaneously and mentioned your \ndesire to wrap up the case before you retired. We informed him that the Office's position is that if Epstein \npromptly abides by the terms of the signed non-prosecution agreement entered into by the Office and Mr. \nEpstein, we will end our investigation. If Mr. Epstein chooses to go forward with a different plea in the State, \nthat is his prerogative, but we will consider it a breach of the federal non-prosecution agreement and will proceed \naccordingly. \nThe federal non-prosecution agreement signed by Mr. Epstein and his counsel requires Mr. Epstein to plead \nguilty to the current state indictment and also to an information charging a state offense that requires sex offender \nregistration, specifically the charge of procuring minors to engage in prostitution, at least 18 months \nimprisonment, and an agreement that the victims can pursue damages claims as though Mr. Epstein had been \nconvicted of the federal offenses. Our agreement does not address probationary periods following the term of \nincarceration. Those are statutorily set on the federal side, so we have left that issue to the defense to negotiate \nwith \nyou. \nIf you have any questions, please let me know. \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \n500 S.
