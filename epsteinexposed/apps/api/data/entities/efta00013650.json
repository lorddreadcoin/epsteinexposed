This Court has \nvenue of this action \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) \nas a substantial \npart \nof the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim \noccurred in this District. \nFactual \nAllegations \n9. At all \nrelevant times, Defendant \nJeffrey Epstein (\"Epstein\") was an \nadult male, 52 \nyears old. \nEpstein is a financier and money \nmanager with a secret clientele \nlimited exclusively to \nbillionaires. He is \nhimself a man of tremendous \nwealth, power and influence. He \nmaintains his \nprincipal home in \nNew York and also owns residences in \nNew Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm \nBeach, \nFL. The allegations herein \nconcern Epstein's conduct while \nat his lavish estate in Palm \nBeach. \n10. Upon \ninformation and belief, Epstein \nhas a sexual preference and \nobsession for \nunderage minor \ngirls. He engaged in a plan and \nscheme in which he gained access to \nprimarily \neconomically disadvantaged minor girls in his \nhome, sexually assaulted these girls, \nand then gave \nthem \nmoney. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, \nthen 14 years old, fell into Epstein's \ntrap and became one \nof his \nvictims. \n11. Upon information \nand belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out \nhis scheme and assaulted \ngirls in Florida, New York and on his \nprivate island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. \n12. An integral \nplayer in Epstein's Florida scheme \nwas \nHERMAN & \nMERMELSTEIN, P. A. \n- 2 - \nwww.hermanlaw.com \nEFTA00013651\n\n.  She recruited girls ostensibly to give a \nwealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's \nplan, \nMs. would be contacted when \nEpstein was \nplanning \nto be at his Palm \nBeach residence \nor soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. to bring \none or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. \n', \nupon information and belief, generally \nsought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who \nwould be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per \"massage\" session - and \nwho were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of \nimproper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. \n13. Epstein's plan and \nscheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at \nEpstein's mansion, Mr. MI would introduce each victim to \nwho gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. \nwould then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a \nmassage table in addition \nto other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the \nbedroom. Ms. would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter \nwearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and \ndirect the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and \nsexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. \n14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. \nrecruited Jane Doe \nto \ngive Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. \nbrought Jane to Epstein's mansion \nin Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to \nME., who led her up the flight of stairs to the room \nwith the massage table. \nHERMAN & \nMERMELSTEIN, P. A. \n- 3 - \nww.v.hermanlaw.com \nEFTA00013652\n\n15. After Epstein had completed \nthe assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get \ndressed, leave the room and go back \ndown the stairs. She then met Ms. again who \nbrought \nJane home. Jane was paid $300 \nby Epstein. Ms. \nwas \npaid $200 by Epstein for \nbringing Jane \nto \nhim. \n16. As a  result of \nthis encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane \nexperienced \nconfusion, shame, \nhumiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. \nCOUNT I \nSexual Assault \n17.
