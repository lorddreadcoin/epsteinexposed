Happy to combine them for you, but it strikes me that what might be \nmost efficient is for me to forward you just the talking points documents (there are only 7), either in one word \ndocument or as individual word files--since that's what you're likely to be editing. \n Original Messa e \nFrom: \na \nSent: Wednesda , June 24, 2020 11:38 AM \nTo:\nSubject: RE: PDF now fine \nHow many word does are there? \n Original Messa e \nFrom:\nSent: Wednesda , June 24, 2020 11:19 AM \nTo: \na \nSubject: RE: PDF now fine \nOf course.

Individual word documents for each part of the briefing book or \neverything in one word document? \n Original Messa e \nFrom: \na \nSent: Wednesda , June 24, 2020 11:17 AM \nTo:\nSubject: PDF now fine \nBut can I get a version I can edit ? \nSent from my iPhone \nEFTA00030004",
