September 2015 \nEFTA00018845\n\nCourt Ordered Restitution Information \nWhat is restitution? \nRestitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a \nresult of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence. \nRestitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or \"pain and suffering.\" \nWhen the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact \nstatement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the \nvictim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does \nnot order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record. \nWhat can I request as restitution? \nYou can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense —  even for items the OVS may not be able to \nreimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of \nearnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property. \nWho is entitled to restitution? \nAnyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek \nrestitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that \nthey are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve. \nHow do I ask for restitution? \nYou should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of \ndamages you are requesting. \nIt is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and \nother documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want \nconsidered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea \nor pre-disposition report). Be sure to: \n• Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense. \n• Give copies of these receipts to the police. DA and local probation department. \nYou need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the \nprobation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided \nbefore the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court. \nThe DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf. \nIn all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision \n(PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you \nabout the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case. \nHow is restitution determined? \nThe amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The \nperpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the \nCourt may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution \nhearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to \nyour case. \nIf the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is \nimportant that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS. \nIf you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution. \nRev.
