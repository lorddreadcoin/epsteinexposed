Here are a few sentences from late in the article: \nThe [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land \nCommissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General \nHector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased by \nEFTA00018553\n\nEpstein \"because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given us \nthe perfect \nreason.\" \nBalderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was \"taking back lands that should be \nmanaged to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children.\" Public schools are one \nbeneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: \"We continue to investigate this matter at the state level \nin coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\" \nraua ana ruouc corruption secuon \nU.S. Attorney's Office — District of New Mexico \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, September 4, 2019 4:12 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Follow Up Call \nThank you for the speedy response.
