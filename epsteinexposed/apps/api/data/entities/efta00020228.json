For the excerpts, I was a bit unsure because there \nwere a lot of objections which I chose to leave in out of caution. Let me know if I should be going back and making \nchanges. \nFrom: \nSent: Monda June 22 2020 10:32 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: grand jury \nApologies for piling on, but if you could please also make slides that have the following excerpts of the attached \ndeposition testimony, that would be a huge help as well: \n1) \n2 ) \n3) \n• The cover page of both days of testimony (so the caption and date shows) \n• The following five excerpts (I think you should be able to just control-F to locate): \nQ. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls \nfor sexual massages? If you know. \nA. I don't know what you're talking about. \nQ. List all the people under the age of 18 that you interacted \nwith at any of Jeffrey's properties? \nA. I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than \nobviously who was 17 at this point. \nQ: Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in \nsexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach house? \nA: No,  not that I \nrecall.  . . . \nQ. \nDo you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or \ndevices used in sexual activities? \nEFTA00020228\n\nA. No. \n4) \n5) \n4• \nOther than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have \nidentified as having been \ninvolved in three-way sexual \nactivities, with whom did Mr. \nEpstein have sexual \nactivities? \nA. \nI wasn't aware \nthat he was having sexual activities with \nanyone when I was with him other than myself. \n4. \nI want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that \nin the 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein \nwas having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself \nand the blond and brunette on those few occasions when they \nwere involved \nwith you? \nA. That is my \ntestimony, that is correct. \n4• \nIs it your testimony that you've never given anybody a \nmassage? \nA. I have not \ngiven anyone a massags\n4• \nYou never \ngave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your \ntestimony? \nA. That is \nmy testimony. \nQ. \nYou never gave [Minor \nVictim-2] a massage is your testimony? \nA. I never gave  [Minor Victim-2]   a massaggs\nThank you! Very much appreciated. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, June 22, 2020 7:17 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: grand jury \nFantastic, thanks! Attached is a sample slide for a model. All the slides will be this same format—the document is an \nexcerpt from flight records. The records are attached — could you please make slides excerpting the records (and flagging \nthe date) for the following flight dates: \n• November 11, 1996. \n• May \n9, 1997 \n• May 3, \n1998 \nEFTA00020229\n\n• August 18, 1994 \n• August 20, 1994 \n• January 3, 1995 \n• February 12, 1995 \nNo need for any introductory material — I'll just drag these slides into my presentation once you prep them. Thanks a ton! \nThis is a big help. \nFrom \nSent: Monday, June 22, 2020 7:10 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: grand jury \nHi \nI'll be sure to have time tomorrow. Just let me know what you need and I can handle it. \nWill \nOn Jun 22, 2020, at 6:50 PM, \nHey \nwrote: \nI'm working on a grand jury presentation on a compressed timeframe, and was hoping you might be able to help put \ntogether a few slides. I'm handling the rest of the slides, but if you could possibly make about seven slides to drop in, \nthat would be a big help — I need to add a few that will all be the same format. Any chance you have time tomorrow? \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00020230",
