We'd very \nmuch appreciate it if the marshals could produce the defendant to a proffer room this week at 500 Pearl Street. Our \nunderstanding from Eric Blachman, copied here, is that the marshals have been producing defendants for meetings of this \ntype. A CSO and a case agent will be present for the meeting. \nCould you please let us know what dates this week would work for the meeting? We are scheduling this with defense \nattorneys who are flying in from out of state, so would appreciate if you could let us know what dates work this week. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00025162",
