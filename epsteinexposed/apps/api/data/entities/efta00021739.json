We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week we'll be \nhaving meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward for aspects of the \ncase including Ms. .  In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you were prepared (and willing) to \nconvey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in the complaint sent on December 4 \n(re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you have additional information that would be helpful to \nconvey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the coming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come \nback, obviously we understand the challenges of scheduling, but we had anticipated trying to see if we could schedule a \ncall in the coming days. Please let us know? \nthanks, \n \nOriginal Message \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 01, 2020 21:50 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: - Following up re proffers \nAll — Happy new year. Wishing you and your families a happy, healthy, and peaceful 2020. We wanted to let you know \nthat there are a few minor clarifications/corrections we want to share with respect t' proffers. I will be out of the \ncountry and not returning to the office until January 1.0a-apple-data-detectors://0> (or possibly January 13a-apple-data-\ndetectors://1>). We will contact you then about scheduling a call to discuss. Many thanks. \nBest, \nD: \nEFTA00021739\n\nThe contents of this message may be privileged and confidential.
