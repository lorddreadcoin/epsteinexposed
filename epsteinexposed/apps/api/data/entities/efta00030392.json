In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information \nwe need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there \nis more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — \nThe two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) \nThe two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) \nEFTA00030399\n\nthe following loose storage devices: \no Micro SD card (NYCO24339) \no  Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) \no  Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) \no hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) \no  verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) \nThe four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) \nThe three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) \nThe camera SD card (NYCO24351) \nI think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI \nspreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. \nThe other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI \nlist also has —  is that info available? \nThe list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce \nall the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm?

We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI \ntool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both \nwe and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. \nI've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that the best \nway to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which \nI just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the \ntaint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. \nAnd we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier \nthis year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I \nunderstand from that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I \nunderstand will be segregated and designated by device.

(NY) (FBI) <> \nJust to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not \"processing\" anything. You are taking files \nthat I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a \ntaint review. \nRelativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a \ncomputer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted \nyou do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was \nalready done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now \nand I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. \nSorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital \nevidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have \ngotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece \nby piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that \nyou wanted to do it \"all at once\", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of \nmethodology I suppose. \nEFTA00030401\n\nand I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the \nattribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a  while \nback was lacking. \nFBI NY CART Coordinator \nSenior Examiner \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:33 AM \nTo: \n. \n(NY) \n(FBI) •::\n1>: \n> \nCc: \n; \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nOkay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run?

Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The \nexcel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on \n2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by \n\"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as \n\"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. \nFor example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see the \nattached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is \nthat a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense \ncounsel. \nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the \nnative files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively \nmeans that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \nRelated, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers \nand no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the \nnative files, it would be impossible. \nEFTA00030406\n\nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get \na similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million \ndocuments without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-\nkeeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW \nreturns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful. \nthanks, \nFrom: (NY) (FBI) \n<> \nSent: Wednesday, March 04, 2020 16:36 \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \n(NY) (FBI) <->; (USANYS) \n(USANYS) [Contractor] <->; \n(FBI) \n<> \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n) < \n(NY) \nHere is a  listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review.

And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / \nserver racks. \nSo we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving \npieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once.

That folder by itself has \nmore than 600,000 items. \nI don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or \nfile names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to \nwhat we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this?
