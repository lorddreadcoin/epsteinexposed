She wasn't aware of the December 16111 date, and \nshe said that she could include something in their plea agreement about not beinz_.z.,, elinible for work release. \nWhen the FBI asked her if she would do that, she said she wo to talk toM She also wouldn't say \nwhether they would oppose such a petition, if one were filed. illaraid that because Epstein is going to be \nhoused at the jail, the Sheriff's Office will determine whether Epstein is eligible for work release, not the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections. I have asked FBI to find out whether \"sexual predators\" (which will be Epstein's \nlegal designation) are eligible to participate in work release. I am still reviewing all of the statutes to see whether \nthere is anything that would bar the judge from granting a petition for work release. As soon as I  find an answer, \nI  will let you know. \nould still like us to do the victim notifications. The State does not have a procedure (like we do \ne  era y) where the Court has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend judicial proceedings, so \nI  do not know how many victims will actually want to be present. \nM\n- As soon as you hear from Judge Davis, can you let me know? It is going to take us a while to track down \neveryone, especially with the holiday, and I  want to make sure they have been provided adequate notice. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSe \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein \ninforms me that said that the plea & sen ill take place on the same \nay ecember 16th ) in order to reduce the media frenzy. •aid that Epstein will be \ntreated as a sex offender regardless of whether he registers or not. He said that \"registration\" \ntakes place after Epstein completes his sentence. Therefore, he will be treated like any other sex \noffender. The problem is that just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work \nEFTA00013754\n\nrelease. When asked hether he was going to oppose such a petition, \ntresponded that he will if it is i ement. \nI spoke to Lefkowitz. Lefkowitz confirmed the above understanding. We did not, however, \ndiscuss anything about work release —just that Epstein will be a sex offender and he'll be \ntreated like any other sex offender. \nLefkowitz confirmed that they will not contact any other victims. He also asked Jack Goldberger \nto provide him with any copies of agreements etc. he has with the State. Jay will forward them \nto me as soon as he receives them. \nFinally, Lefkowitz said that the statement in his letter that he \"reserves [the] right to object to \ncertain aspects of the §2255 provisions of the Agreement\" refers to their belief that a lawyer \nwho files a lawsuit for some of the class may have a direct conflict that may disqualify him/his \nfirm if he's accepting fees to negotiate the settlement of the other members of the class. \nLefkowitz point out the potential conflict to whoever is selected. My view is that those issues \nare between Epstein's lawyers and the victims' lawyers. \nEFTA00013755",
