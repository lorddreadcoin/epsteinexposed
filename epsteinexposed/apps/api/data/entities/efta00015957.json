We are not providing weekend calls generally at this time, and counsel has been having \n2 hour legal calls every afternoon in addition to the standing call set up in the morning. This is far more than almost every \nEFTA00015957\n\nother inmate receives prior to an arraignment. Most other arraignments have been set up with one or two days notice, with \nonly one call to counsel and one call to pretrial services. \nI have received no calls or emails from counsel, so I'm not sure where they have made these emergency requests. \nThey will have another call with her tomorrow, and I can let staff know they will request the call on Tuesday as well. \n>>> \n< >  7/12/2020 12:42 PM >>> \nFollowing up, we heard from defense counsel that they didn't receive a  call this morning either and that they filed an \nemergency request but haven't heard back. Please let us know the status as soon as possible? They also wanted to confirm \nthat they will have calls at 10:00 tomorrow and Tuesday. Again, we realize this is unusual but I'm not aware of any other \ndefendants who are in this circumstance of having a bail hearing pending in just two days.

We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell at \nthe number he has previously provided.

Requests should be sent to \nTruly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, counsel \nreally should send the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to ensure \ninmates get equitable access. If they anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should make requests in \nadvance and note whether and when calls would be preferred. Generally, calls are for 30 minutes in \nduration.

Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel \nthus far. There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. \nWould you be able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they \nunderstand what steps to take going forward? \nThank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it. \nBest, \nFrom: IM \nSent: Tuesday, July 7, 2020 4:23 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nI < \nSubject: RE: Ghislaine Maxwell (USMS No. 02879-509) \nYou're welcome. \nWould 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), \nin advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same \nprotocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. \nI also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to \nfacilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-\nday, that we were again able to accommodate.
