    "text": "\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nResponse to Letter by \nFAUSA MI Dated May \n19, 2008 \nIn al 2008 letter to Jay Lefkowitz (See Tab 1), SDFL First \nAssistant U.S. \nrn\nAttoey MI \nprovided what purported to be a  summ \nof the events that have \noccurred during the investigation of Mr. \nEpstein. Mr. letter is fraught \nwith \ninconsistencies, false and \nmisleading characterizations and \noutright falsehoods. The comparison \nbelow between the \nfalse assertions in Mr. letter and what actually \ntranspired is only the \ntip of the iceberg. We respectfully submit that Mr. \nletter alone \ndemonstrates the \ndegree to which the record \nof facts have been distorted and these distortions have \npermeated this \nunprecedented investigation. \n1. \"INDEPENDENT\" AND \"DE NOVO\" REVIEW. \nMr. \nLetter: \n• \"[W]e obliged your request \nfor an independent de novo review \nof the investigation and \nfacilitated such review at the highest \nlevels of the Department of Justice. \" Tab 1, May \n19, 2008 Letter from'. \nP. 5, 1 3. \nThe Truth: \n• \nCEOS' review, concluded in May 2008, was \nneither independent nor de novo. \no \nCEOS' review was not \"independent:\" \n• \nwho conducted the review \non behalf of CEOS, had \nalready reviewed the prosecution \nmemo on this matter eight months \nearlier. During a  meeting \nwith defense counsel at the \nUnited States \nAttorney's Office in Miami \n(the \"USAO\") in September of 2007, he \nopined that he so believed in the \nprosecution that he \"would try the case \nmyself\" \n• Indeed, Mr. \nacknowledges that Mr. \nopined on this matter, stating: \nhad previously \nThis particular attack on this \nstatute [18 U.S.C. § 2242(b)] \nhad been previously raised and \nthoroughly considered and \nrejected by .  .  .  CEOS prior to \nthe execution of the \n[Deferred Prosecution] Agreement [in September 2007]. \nId., p. 5 (emphasis added). \n• \nThe statute Mr. referred to (§ 2422(b) lies at the heart of the \nEpstein investigation. Thus, according to Mr. , \nMr. \nwas tasked with reviewing his own prior \ndecision regarding applying the \nkey statute under which the SDFL proposed \nprosecuting Mr. Epstein. \nEFTA00013801\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS \nLLP \n■ \nThe defense immediately raised concerns regardin the non\n-independence \nof the review when told that it would be Mr. \ntasked with \nproviding the review, but \nwas told that when Mr. \nrendered his \nprior opinion, \"he was not really up to speed on the facts\" \no CEOS' review was not de novo: \n• \nB letter dated May 15, 2008 (four days before Mr. \nletter), Mr. \nadvised Mr. \nLefkowitz that CEOS reviewed the matter only \nfor abuse of \ndiscretion: \nMite question we sought to answer was whether U.S. \nAttorney Acosta would abuse his \ndiscretion if he \nauthorized \nprosecution in this case. \nSee Tab 38, \nMay 15, 2008 Letter from D. EMI, \np. 1   (emphasis \nadded). See also, id., p. 2 (\"Mr. Acosta would not \nbe abusing his \ndiscretion \nif he decided to pursue \nsuch a \ncourse \nof action.\"); and p. 5 \n(\"Mr. Acosta would not be \nabusing his prosecutorial discretion should he \nauthorized federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein.\"). \n■ \nFor the factual record of its \"abuse of \ndiscretion\" review, CEOS relied on \nthe very same prosecution memo that it had already reviewed in rendering \nits prior opinion, \nstating: \nAs you know, our review of this case is \nlimited, both factually and \nlegally. We have not looked at the entire universe of facts in this \ncase. \nSee Id., p. 1 \n(emphasis added). \n■ \nNor \ndid CEOS review any facts related to the irregular provisions in the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement or the \nnumerous complaints of \nprosecutorial misconduct, both of which are \ninextricably intertwined with \nthe impropriety of \nthe investigation. Id. at 1. \n2. NOTIFICATION OF WITNESSES. \nMr. Letter: \n• Mr. \ndismissed the totality of the defense's objections to the inappropriate \nnoti 'cation the SDFL proposed to send to its witnesses, stating merely \nthat: \n\"[Y]ou objected to victims['] being notified of time and place of \nEpstein's \nstate[\n-]court \nsentencing hearing.\" \n2 \nEFTA00013802\n\nKIRKLAII IS LLP \nSee Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from \n, p. 4, ¶ \n1. \nThe Truth: \n• The defense engaged in \ndays of negotiation and made 1 Sicarate \nsubstantive objections \nto the \nunprecedented notification letter that Mr. \nthreatened to send to an \nundisclosed list of \"victims.\" The eventual transmission of this highly misleading letter \nwas only halted by an \nappeal to AAG Fisher. Among those \nsubstantive objections \n(which related to far \nmore than the \"time and place\" of the state's sentencing hearing) \nwere: \no Sending the letter would contravene the \ngovernment's commitment to take no \nposition regarding potential claims of \ngovernment witnesses. See Tab 39, \nNovember 28, 2008 Email from I. Lefkowitz to I. \no \nThe letter cited to an inapplicable statute (the Justice for All Act of 2004) as its \njustification for being sent. Id. AUSA Acosta later \nconceded that the citation to \nthis statute as a justification was wholly \nincorrect. \no The letter \nwrongly advised all recipients that Mr. Epstein would be required to \nregister as \"a \nsexual predator for the remainder of this life.\" \no The letter amounted to an invitation to civil litigation \nagainst Mr. Epstein, \nadvising recipients that they had the right to seek civil \ndamages from Mr. Epstein, \nand in an \nunderlined instruction, stated that if they chose an attorney other than \nthe one chosen by the government they would be required to \npay his fees, but if \nthey chose the government's \nchoice, Mr. Epstein would be required to pay the \nfees. \n3. MISCHARACTEFUZATION OF OUR \nARGUMENTS. \nMr. \nLetter: \n• Mr. \nletter misleadingly characterizes our substantive defense of the \ngovernment's investigation as, \"the investigation \nmerely produced evidence of relatively \ninnocuous sexual conduct with \nsome minors who, unbeknownst to Mr. Epstein, \nmisrepresented their ages.\" \nSee Tab \nI, \nMay 19, 2008 Letter from I. p. 2. \nThe Truth: \n• We never made such a claim. To the contrary, we argued that sworn statements we have \ntaken of the \nalleged victims demonstrate that law enforcement has presented versions of \ntheir testimony that \nare necessarily sensationalized and fictionalized. We presented \n3 \nEFTA00013803\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nevidence that Mr. Epstein \nroutinely and daily receives \nmassages from adults. Only a \nsmall \npercentage of the masseuses \nturned out to be minors. The \nmajority of those minors \ninterviewed \nby law enforcement \nadmitted to lying directly to \nEpstein about their ages \n(not \n\"unbeknownst to Epstein\"), and inventing \nfurther false details to \nsubstantiate their \nlies. Indeed, the civil \nattorney for several of these \nwomen admitted at his recent press \nconference that they lied to Mr. \nEpstein about their ages. \nNumerous witnesses testified \nthat Mr. \nEpstein asked that all masseuses \nbe over the age of 18. Further, \nthe evidence is \nundisputed that \nMr. Epstein's assistants scheduled the \nmassages and Mr. Epstein did not \nknow which masseuses \nhis assistants had scheduled on \na particular day, until the \nmassage \ntook place. We \nadmitted that there was sexual \nconduct, and argued—not that it \nwas \n\"innocuous\" as Mr. \nalleges—but that it  was mostly \nMr. Epstein's own self-\npleasuring, \nwhich did not satisfy the requisite \nfederal clement of criminal \nsexual conduct \n(which is in turn, \ndefined by state law). These \nare important distinctions \nand show that \nMr. has misrepresented \nthe record about the most \nbasic part of our defense. \n4. \nMr \nDEMANDS AN UNREALISTIC \nDEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH AN \nAGREEMENT HE \nUNILATERALLY MODIFIES. \nLetter: \n• \"Unless [Mr. \nEpstein] complies with all of the \nterms and conditions of the \n[Deferred \nProsecution] Agreement, as \nmodified by the United States Attorney's \nDecember 19, \n2007 letter to Ms. Sanchez by close \nof business on Monday, June 2, \n2008, the SDFL will \nelect to \nterminate the Agreement.\" Id., p.1 \nThe Truth: \n• \nThe Deferred Prosecution \nAgreement was never modified by \nU.S. Attorney Acosta's \nDecember 19, 2007 letter. Oddly, Mr. \nacknowledges this on page 4 of \nhis May \n19 \nletter, where he writes that Mr. \nAcosta \"proposed\" this \nmodification and that \"[Mr. \nLefkowitz] rejected \nthese proposals.\" Thus, Mr. \nis threatening to terminate the \nDeferred \nProsecutioniriment, unless Mr. Epstein \ncomplies with a unilateral \nmodification that Mr. \nconcedes was never agreed to \nby defense counsel. \n• \nOrchestrating the \ninformation, plea and sentencing \nrequirements of the Deferred \nProsecution Agreement within the extremely \nlimited two-week timeframe imposed by \nMr. \nJune 2, 2008 deadline would have been difficult \nenough. \n• \nMore importantly, as explained \nbelow, the SDFL has refused to \nprovide the defense with \ninformation \nit  requires to enable Mr. Epstein to \ncomply with the additional plea \nand \nsentencing requirements of the Deferred \nProsecution Agreement (let alone, by the June 2 \ndeadline arbitrarily imposed \nby Mr. \n). \no The Deferred Prosecution \nAgreement requires Mr. Epstein to \nplead guilty to and \nbe sentenced for an additional \noffense which requires that he be registered as a \nsex offender. In different places in \nhis May 19, 2008 letter, Mr. \n4 \nEFTA00013804\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \ndescribes the additional charge to which \nMr. Epstein is required to plead guilty \nunder the Deferred Prosecution Agreement as \n\"procurement of minors to engage \nin \nprostitution\" or \"solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution.\" The former \nis an offense for which \nMr. Epstein would be required to register, \nbut one for \nwhich the state has no evidence \nto charge Mr. Epstein and the SDFL refuses or is \nunable to provide evidence that it claims it has. \nThe latter re uires no \nregistration, \nbut it is the offense which, \nover and over again, Ms. \ninsisted upon \nincluding in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, and is one which \nthe State believes is \nappropriate. The inconsistency between \nthe description of \nthe \noffense required by the SDFL, the elements of an offense that can be justified \non the facts of this case and \nthe SDFL's requirement that the offense be a \nregistrable one has created \nsubstantial confusion. \no As a  result of this confusion, in December 2007, both the defense and \nthe \nstate \nrequested that the SDFL \nprovide the factual allegations to enable Mr. Epstein and \nthe State to create a truthful factual recitation of a registrable offense required by \nthe Deferred Prosecution \nAgreement, but, to date, the SDFL has failed to do so \nwithout any \nexplanation. \n• Mr. \nrefuses to provide the requested factual allegations, which \nthe State cannot \nfurnish, and now demands a  two \nweek deadline to comply. Thus Mr. has \nunreasonably imposed a deadline with which he himself has made it impossible \nfor Mr. \nEpstein to comply. \n5. WAIVER OF \nAPPEAL TO ASSISTANT \nATTORNEY GENERAL FISHER. \nMr. Letter: \n• \"[T]he SDFL provided you with 30 \ndays to appeal the decision to the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the \nUnited States Alice Fisher\" and \"you chose to forego an appeal to AAG \nFisher.\" \nId., p. 2. \nThe \nTruth: \n• Mr. Acosta tolled an August 17 \ndeadline, acknowledging that there were \"serious issues\" \nabout the case that needed to be discussed, and scheduled a meetin with the defense for \nSeptember 7, 2007. At the September 7, 2007 \nmeeting, with \nin \nattendance, the government dismissed the defense's objections and set a  September 21, \n2007 deadline to \nfinalize a  non-prosecution agreement or the defense would face an \nalready-drafted 53-page indictment, purportedly identifying 40 minors, with a guideline \nrange of 188 months. \n• Facing \nMs. threatened draconian indictment, without the claimed offer of the \nright to raise objections in an appeal to AAG Fisher, the defense chose to negotiate an \n5 \nEFTA00013805\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nAgreement to \nDefer Prosecution to the State, an \nagreement without precedent and \nfraught \nwith substantial \npractical and legal hurdles to its \nimplementation. \n6. THE SDFL DID \nNOT DEFER TO THE STATE. \nLetter: \n• \"[T]he SDFL indicated a \nwillingness to defer to the State the length of \nincarceration.\" \nId., p. 2. \nThe \nTruth: \n• \nThe SDFL neither deferred to the \nState, nor even discussed with the \nState, the len th of \nMr. \nein's incarceration. In a letter to the \ndefense, Criminal Division \nChief, \nrejected the sentence contemplated by the \nState's plea agreement, writing that \n\"the federal interest will \nnot be vindicated in the absence of a \ntwo- ear term of state \nimprisonment.\" See Tab 40, August 3, 2007 Email \nfrom \n.   Of course, this \nposition is contrary to Section \n9-2031D of the U.S. Attorney's Manual \n(indicating that \nthe \"result\" of a state prosecution \nis \"presumed ' to have vindicated the federal \ninterest). \nIt is understandable, therefore, that Mr. \nmight want to \nretreat from it now. \nIndeed, the final Deferred \nProsecution Agreement (DPA) restricts the state\n-court judge \nfrom \nexercising any of his rightful discretion and \nto specifically prohibit the judge from \noffering \nprobation, community control or any other \nalternative in lieu of incarceration. \nDPA, \n1 \n2(a). \n7. \nSUGGESTION OF ADDITIONAL STATE PLEA \nMr. \nLetter: \n• The parties considered: \"as \nsuggested by [the defense], a plea \nto state charges \nencompassing Epstein's conduct.\" See Tab \n1, May 19, 2008 Letter from'. \n=, p.2, \n¶ 2. \nThe \nTruth: \n• It  was \nthe government, and not the defense \nthat suggested a  plea to state charges \nto \nresolve the \nfederal investigation. \nproposed declining prosecution in favor \nof the state. Although Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office had \nalready reached \na plea agreement, in \nAugust 2007, Mr. and \nAUSA warned that \nthey intended to prosecute Epstein federally unless his counsel \n(i.e., not the U.S. \nAttorney's Office) sought \nmore stringent conditions to the \nState's proposed plea \nagreement. These strip ent conditions included, among other things, the two-year \nprison \nterm demanded by Mr. \n(discussed above) and a charge requiring \nhim to register \nas a \nsex offender. \n6 \nEFTA00013806\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \n8. ALL \nIDENTIFIED VICTIMS BE PUT \nIN SAME POSITION AS \nIF EPSTEIN \nHAD BEEN TRIED. \nMr. \nLetter: \n• \"The \nAgreement provides for a  method of \ncompensation for the victims such that \nthey \nwould be placed \nin the same position as if Epstein had been \nconvicted of one of the \nenumerated offenses set forth in \nTitle 18, United States Code \nSection, 2255.\" \nId. \nThe Truth: \n• Mr. \ncontinues to \nmischaracterize the highly irregular provisions of the Deferred \nProsecution Agreement. The SDFL did not \nmerely attempt to preserve the compensation \nrights of those \nit identified as victims; it attempted to \ncreate compensation rights for those \nit  identified, without \nimposing on them the burden of proving that they were \nin fact \nvictims under § 2255. \no In the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the \nSDFL required Mr. Epstein to waive \nthe right to contest liability under \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 as to a  list of individuals that \nthe SDFL would not disclose to Mr. Epstein until \nafter he was sentenced and to \npay for an \nattorney to secure compensation \nunder § 2255 for those \nundisclosed \nindividuals, or if they decided to sue Mr. Epstein. \no § 2255 ordinarily provides individuals \nwith a right to recover minimum guaranteed \ndamages of $150,000, without having to \nprove actual damages, only if: (1) they \nwere victims of an \nenumerated federal offense, including \noffenses under 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 2422 and 2423, \n(2) they were minors at the time of \nthe offense, and most \nimportantly (3) \nthey were personally injured as a \nresult of the offense. \no The defense has confirmed examples of \nwomen who testified that they were not \nvictims of Mr. Epstein and suffered no personal injury. \nThese women were, \nnevertheless, \non the list of \"victims\" identified by the government. .  In fact, when \nconfronted with the \ntestimony of a  women who \ndenied both being a  victim and \nincurring \npersonal injury, Ms. actually acknowledged such testimony. \ny inclusion of that woman \non the government's list, however, Ms.\nlI\nistif \nthen challenged her \nown witness's credibility. \n• \nFor this reason, it  is false to state that these \"identified\" \nindividuals are in the same \nposition that they would \nhave been had Epstein been convicted \nat trial. Had there been a \ntrial, Mr. Epstein \nwould have had a  right to confront these individuals through cross-\nexamination. Any individual that \ndid not establish that she was a minor victim \nof conduct \nthat satisfied each \nelement of an enumerated statute under §  2255,or that she suffered \npersonal injury, would not qualify for any treatment \nunder § 2255. However, under the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement, as an \n\"identified individual\" on the government's list, \n7 \nEFTA00013807\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS \nLLP \nthis \nsame individual would nevertheless \nbe entitled to engage an attorney \npaid for by Mr. \nEpstein to recover $150,000 of damages from \nMr. Epstein under §  2255 without ever \nalleging any \ninjury. In fact, the defense was told \nthat the only question Mr. Epstein \nwould be permitted to ask \nbefore paying the girls is \"  have you ever met \nEpstein.\". Thus, \nthe Deferred Prosecution Agreement \nplaces identified individuals in a  far better \nposition \nthan they would be in \nif Mr. Epstein were \nconvicted at trial. \n9. \nASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO \nSELECT LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. \nMr. Letter: \n• \"Prior to any issues arising \nconcerning the implementation of the \n2255 provision, the \nSDFL unilaterally agreed to assign its \nresponsibility to select the attorney representative \nfor the \nalleged victims to an independent third-party.\" \nSee Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from'. p. 4, f.3. \nThe \nTruth: \n• That such an \nassignment was the SDFL's \"unilateral\" \ndecision is false. Before the \nSDFL decided to assi \nselection of the \"attorney representative\" to an independent third \nparty, \nAUSA had already proposed an \"attorney representative.\" \nShe \nhad proposed local products-liability \nlawyer, Humberto Ocariz, and claimed he had been \nrecommended by a \"good friend in the Appellate Division.\" Ms. \naccount was \nmisleading, as it  omitted \nthat this \"good friend\" was her live-in \nboyfriend, and that Mr. \nOcariz was his former law-school \nroommate. When we discovered this independently, \nwe objected. Only then did the \nSDFL propose assigning the selection \nprocess to an \nindependent special master and agree to \namend the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. \nThus, while it may be true that the SDFL assigned its \nselection responsibility to avoid the \nappearance of favoritism, it  did not do it \n\"unilaterally,\" but, rather, only after Epstein \nuncovered the Office's misleading disclosure and apparent conflict-of-interest. \n10. TIMETABLE FOR MOVING FORWARD. \nMr. \nLetter: \n• \"On February 25, 2008, \nI sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward \nin the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now.\" \nId., p. 6. \nThe \nTruth: \n• Mr. \nprovides only part of the history of this case in order to justify his improper \nactions. He had stated he would close the investigation if CEOS told him to. However, \nCEOS at our very first contact said that under no \ncircumstances did they see that as their \n8 \nEFTA00013808\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nrole. They said they would only advise on an abuse of discretion standard. Making the \noutcome a  foregone conclusion. Furthermore, in response to the February 25 e-mail, \nwhich attempted to establish a schedule to limit the entire review process (the defense has \nrepeatedly suggested that the misconduct was intertwined with the investigation and \nwould therefore \nseek \nhigher \nreview), Mr. Lefkowitz e-mailed Mr. Acosta directly. On \nFebruary 29, 2028 Mr. responded to Mr. Lefkowitz's e-mail to Mr. Acosta, \nstating that Mr. was acting out of frustration, but \"[p]lease be assured that it has \nnot, and never has been, this Office's intent to interfere or restrict the \"review process\" \nfor either Mr. Epstein or \nCEOS. I  leave it  to you and CEOS to figure out how best to \nproceed and will await the results of that process.\" As stated above, CEOS determined \nthat it would not review many of the defense's objections and as to the remainder of those \nobjections, its review would be limited (contrary to Mr. Acosta's assurances), which left \nthe need, supplemented by the defense's subsequent request, for a more thorough review \nof critical issues by others at the Department of Justice. Mr. re-imposition of \nthe (albeit modestly extended) timetable was an obvious attempt, in violation of his \nFebruary 29 agreement, to thwart the request \nmade by the defense to the Deputy Attorney \ngeneral, to complete the review process that Mr. Acosta had promised. \n11. \n\"DELAY.\" \nMr. \nLetter: \n• \nIn a  section entitled \"Delay,\" Mr. states that \"the SDFL again agreed to \naccommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on \nJanuary 4, 2008.\" \nId., p. 3. \nThe Truth: \n• \nCuriously, Mr. fails to mention correspondence from the U.S. Attorney stating \nthat delay of that date would be \"inevitable\" as the defense has raised \"serious questions\" \nabout the propriety of the prosecution. Strikingly, in that same section, Mr. \nclaims that \"the Agreement did not contemplate a  staggered `plea and \nsentencing,\"' \ndespite quoting, three sentences earlier, from the Agreement's staggered requirement \nthat Epstein plead and be sentenced by October 26, and \"begin serving his sentence not \nlater than January 4, 2008.\" \nWe are, like most attorneys seeking Department review, without access to the USAO \nprosecution summaries or other submissions to the Department. Given the substantial issues that \nhave been raised in this and other submissions, we request that you conduct a de novo review \nthat goes beneath the face of any \nconclusions being advocated by the USAO; instead, we seek a \nreview that is based on the \ntranscripts of witness testimony themselves so that the reviewer can \n9 \nEFTA00013809\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nmake an independent decision not adversely affected by conclusions that over and over have \nproven, witness by witness, allegation by allegation, to be inaccurate and unwarranted and not an \nappropriate basis for the exercise of federal prosecutorial authority. \n10 \nEFTA00013810",
