We will get this done after pushing out the 3500. \nIn looking at the FedEx documents we are pretty confident that they were never produced in discovery. I've downloaded \nand stamped them and drafted a cover letter (attached). Should these materials be stamped with the same text that \nsent previously (\"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7,8, 9, 10, 15, and 17\")? If so, I'll add it to each \nof them. \nThere are also a number of additional materials that are saved in a  pending production folder here: \nWilsa.doj.gov\\clowANYS\\StAndrews‘Shared‘USvEpstein-2018R01618\\Discovery‘GM\\27 Eighteenth Production (2021-07-\nxx) \nAre these materials good to be stamped as well or should we just produce the FedEx materials and wait on the rest? \nThanks, \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 2021 2:40 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] <>; \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n> \nSubject: RE: GM FedEx Project \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nThanks so much for \nhelping out with this project.
