Includes lawyers/legal visits; \n• Understanding that there is not another inmate with backup camera system; reason for backup is that sometimes \nBOP camera fails and decision made to have backup camera that covers same area covered by normal area \n• Happy to go back to MDC and say should not record anything not recorded by normal cameras \nSternheim \n• 3 officers watching 2 people in room where no one else, and camera pointed on us \nEverdell \n• Already in a cage, not particularly pleasant; add stress of having handheld camera pointed directly at you; \nsomeone has camera up in your face, all the time; very invasive \n• If cameras already recording, then why is it needed if just redundant; causes real disruption and distress in some \nways \nSternheim \n• Invasive, maybe they will read lips; going far in my example; BOP overusing their authority \nEFTA00032005\n\n• What I'm taking away from this is that unless MDC stops entirely with second camera, that want warden brought \nbefore Judge Nathan \nSternheim \n• Want explanation directly from Warden why this is being done and why being done to GM; why degree of \nsurveillance and searches on GM \n• Any searching and surveillance beyond what is done to other inmates \n• Why locked in at 8 pm? \nSternheim \n• Not saying GP is good for her; not using day room which would eliminate a lot of these issues; but have elected \nnot to do that \n• Let warden explain why \n• From MDC perspective, client gets more benefits than many inmates, gets special treatment given all access she \nhas \nSternheim \n• Given other treatment, where she is virtually in solitary confinement; don't view giving her more time to review \ndiscovery that ameliorates fact that she is being treated differently \n• Client is first had where did not go to SHU, but went to own wing of jail where has access to computer, TV, etc., \nthat would have in GP; treated differently than someone who would ordinarily go to protective custody \nEverdell \n• Feel like there has to be some recognition from the Government that GM finds herself in position she is in b/c of \nwho she is; \n• To hear that getting perks, from defense side, starts b/c she is put in solitary \n• Not fair to say she is better off than other inmates \n• In solitary, recorded 24 hours a day —  b/c of who she is \n• Want to make sure she is in her chair at trial b/c of what happened with Epstein \nSternheim \n• Advocates of our client; putting you in role for being lawyer for BOP which is not correct \n• Let warden say what he needs to say before the judge \n• To recap, areas would like to see improved, surveillance — asking that second camera be removed entirely? Or is \nthere any modification that would be acceptable to you? \nSternheim \n• don't have firm answer; don't think when meeting with her or every step of the way \n• Will convey to BOP reducing use of camera and certainly not pointing into room where attorney meetings take \nplace \n• Other issue is amount of searching —  reduced to amount of searching that other inmates experience \n• Waking her up at night — ask that do nothing differently than what do to check on other inmates at night \nEverdell \n• One other point on searches; when moves from isolation cell to day room to do discovery review, etc., that \ninvolves a bunch of searches too; our understanding was plan was for her to be housed in day room \n• Need to keep her in certain room when would limit movement and searches if housed in day room \n• Will raise day room again \nSternheim \n• Not allowed to maintain any food that she doesn't eat \n• Think same for everyone; so that don't make hooch \nEFTA00032006\n\n• How much time she needs to review discovery? We understand a lot of discovery; have been over-inclusive in \nwhat we have given you; we have given you material that we don't anticipate using at trial, that doesn't relate to \nyour client; 1.2 million documents is searchable to help expedite review \n• If think client needs more than 13 hours a day, please let me know; when pushed MDC to allow for time to \nreview discovery, have been responsive \nEverdell \n• Only get extension cord after laptop dies; don't know if has gotten better \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nTel: \nEFTA00032007",
