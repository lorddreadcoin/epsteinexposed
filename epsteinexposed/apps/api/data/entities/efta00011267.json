Although the OPR Report is \npublicly available and accessible through multiple websites, the Government has elected to \nproduce a \ncopy to you as a courtesy. \nIn addition, due to an inadvertent error in Bates stamping in the prior production, which \nthe Government just discovered, we are reproducing certain of the materials in the below index. \nThese items were originally produced with incorrect Bates numbers that resulted in overlaps. \nThese errors have now been corrected. These discovery materials are now stamped with the correct \ncontrol numbers SDNY GM 00328069.001 through SDNY GM 00328069.794. _ _ _ _ \nEFTA00011267\n\nPage 2 \nPlease note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, \n2020 Protective Order in this case.'
