PURPOSE AND \nOVERVIEW \nThe Epstein Victims' \nCompensation Program (the \n\"Program\") is a \nvoluntary, independent Program \nthat \nhas been \nestablished to compensate \nand resolve the claims \nof victims-survivors of \nsexual abuse by \nJeffrey Epstein (\"Epstein\"). \nThe Estate of \nJeffrey E  stein (the \n\"Estate\") has retained the \nservices of nationally recognized \nclaims \nadministration experts \nand \n.MNIIMMMMENIMMEto design the \nProgram. \nwill also serve \nas the Administrator of the \nProgram (the \n\"Administrator\"). This \nProtocol reflects \ninput from victims\n-survivors, their lawyers, other \npotentially interested \nparties, and \nrepresentatives of the Estate. \nThrough \nthe Program, the Estate \nwishes to acknowledge the \nwrongs endured by victims\n-survivors and \noffer them an \nopportunity to voluntarily resolve \ntheir individual claims for \nsuch sexual abuse. \nThe Program is \ngoverned by the following \nnon-exclusive guiding \nprinciples: \n• The Program is \npurely voluntary. It does not \naffect any rights a  Claimant may \nhave \nunless and until the \nClaimant accepts the \noffered compensation and executes \na \nRelease. \nA Claimant may \nreject the offer of \ncompensation and may \nstop \nparticipating in the Program \nand withdraw the claim \nat any time prior to \nexecution \nof the \nRelease. \n• The Program is \nindependent and will in no way \nbe administered, controlled \nor \noverseen by the Estate. \nThe Administrator is \nresponsible for all decisions \nrelating to \nthe review, processing \nand evaluation of \nindividual claims submitted to \nthe \nProgram. The Administrator \nwill have final, binding \nand exclusive authority to \ndetermine \nClaimant eligibility and the \nvaluation of each eligible \nindividual claim. \nDecisions of the \nAdministrator made pursuant to \nthis Protocol are not \nsubject to \nreview or modification in \nany way by the Estate \nor any other party or \nentity. \n• \nThere is no cap \nor limitation on the \naggregate amount of \nfunds available to \ncompensate all \neligible Claimants or on \nthe amount of \ncompensation to be made to \neach individual \nClaimant. Each individual claim \nwill be evaluated \nseparately by the \nAdministrator. The \nAdministrator will \ndetermine, in her sole \nand exclusive \ndiscretion, issues of eligibility \nand the amount of \ncompensation and the \nEstate will \npay all \neligible claims based on \nthe Administrator's \ndetermination. \nWage \nEFTA00010052\n\n• All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to \nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To \nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the \nAdministrator will manage the process \nso that all Claimants can equally access \nthe Program's claim process. Individuals \nwith \ndisabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate \ntheir \nclaims and to request special process accommodations. \nThe Program is \navailable to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when \nthey were \nharmed, whether the claim is  time-barred by the \napplicable statute of limitations, and whether they \nhave \npreviously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. \nThe exclusive claims period for filing a \nclaim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (\"Filing Deadline\"). All \nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this \nperiod. \nTo complement the Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent \nof the Claimant, consult with Professor ,  a  nationally \nrecognized sexual abuse expert, \nleading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. role will be to \nfurther inform the \nAdministrator and her staff about the \ndynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, \nand the impact of sexual \nabuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or \nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding \nsensitivities involved in \ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a  referral source for the Administrator in \nproviding post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, \ncounseling or other services. The \nAdministrator may, at her discretion \nand with the Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. \nreview an individual claimant file. \nThe Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in \nher discretion, the \nneed to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them with Ms.. \nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to \nthe administration \nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and \ndetermination of individual claims \nsubmitted to the \nProgram. \nDuring \nthe term of the Program, Ms. will not meet or speak with a  Claim \nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. \nM \nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose \noutside the Program any information she obtains \nthrough her participation in the \nProgram, including individual Claimants' submissions. \nWage \nEFTA00010053\n\nII. \nELIGIBILITY \nREQUIREMENTS \nA. Eligibility \nCriteria \nThe persons eligible to participate in this \nProgram are individuals who allege they were sexually abused \nby Epstein. In \naddition, the following criteria \napply: \n• The claim of sexual \nabuse must be directed against \nEpstein. \n• \nAn individual whose claim is time-barred by the \napplicable statute of limitations may \nparticipate in the \nProgram provided that other eligibility \ncriteria are met. \n• An individual who previously entered into a  settlement \nagreement resolving a  claim of sexual \nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program \nprovided that other eligibility criteria are \nmet. \n• An individual who allegedly \nassisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors \nmay \nparticipate in the Program \nwhere there is  a  credible basis to determine that the \nindividual \nacted under duress as a  result of her own sexual \nabuse by Epstein, provided that other \neligibility \ncriteria are met. \n• If the \nClaimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the \nClaimant must dismiss with \nprejudice \nany existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate \nor related entities \nand/or related individuals. The \nClaimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or \nprior to the signed acceptance of the \ncompensation determination offer letter and executed \nRelease in order to receive payment. \nB. Legal \nRepresentatives of \nClaimants \nAn individual may file a  claim \non a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal \nauthority \nto act in a  representative capacity pursuant to \nappropriate law. The \"Legal Representative\" of an \nindividual \nClaimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently \na minor, a parent or legal \nguardian \nauthorized by law to serve as the minor's legal \nrepresentative; (2) in the case of an \nincompetent or legally incapacitated \nClaimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's \nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in \nthe case of a  deceased Claimant, a person \nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's \nestate by a  court of \ncompetent \njurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) \nan attorney authorized to \nrepresent the Claimant for \npurposes of pursuing a claim through \nthis Program. \nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation \ndemonstrating representative capacity.

The Administrator will \nconsider \nappropriate factors and corroborative \nsupport, including but not \nlimited to: \n• The \nlevel of documentation, \ncorroboration or other circumstantial \nevidence regarding the \nnature and \nextent of the abuse, the frequency, \nlocation and other details of the abuse, \nand the \nage of the \nvictim at the time of the abuse. Non\n-exhaustive examples of such evidence \ninclude \n(i) medical or \npsychiatric counseling/therapy \nrecords relevant to the abuse, \nand \n(ii) contemporaneous \nwritten notification or other \ncorrespondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the \nabuse by the Claimant to \nlaw enforcement authorities, parents, \nfriends or others.

A Claimant \nmay reject the \noffer of \ncompensation and \nmay stop \nparticipating in the \nProgram and \nwithdraw the claim \nat any time \nprior to the \nexecution of the \nRelease. \nThe \nRelease will waive \nany rights the \nClaimant and her \nheirs, descendants, \nlegatees or \nbeneficiaries \nmay have to \nassert any claims \nrelating to \nallegations of sexual \nabuse against the \nEstate, related \nentities \nand/or related \nindividuals, to file \nan individual \nlegal action \nrelating to such \nallegations, or to \nparticipate in any civil \nlegal action \nassociated with such \nallegations, \nexcept as a  witness. \nHowever, \nthe \nRelease will not \noperate to \npreclude or limit the \nClaimant's \nability to report \nand discuss \nallegations of sexual \nabuse with law \nenforcement \nofficials or anyone \nelse. In other \nwords, the \nRelease \nwill not impose \nany rules of \nconfidentiality on \nclaimants, who are \nexpressly permitted \nto \ndiscuss \ntheir allegations \nwithout \nrestriction, should they \nchoose. \nBefore signing a \nRelease, the \nClaimant must consult \nwith an attorney \nselected by the \nClaimant. If the \nClaimant is not \nrepresented by an \nattorney, the \nProgram will provide an \nattorney to \nprovide free legal \ncounseling to \nthe Claimant for the \nsole purpose of \nadvising the \nClaimant concerning \nthe language and \nbinding nature of \nthe Release. \nNo \none affiliated with \nthe Program \nwill provide tax or \nlegal advice to \nthose receiving \npayments under \nthe \nProgram. \nClaimants are urged to \nconsult with a \ntax advisor \nconcerning any \nquestions regarding \ntax \nliability for \npayments pursuant to \nthe Program. \n4.

Claims \nthat appear to be \npotentially \nfraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false \nwhen made will be \nforwarded to \nfederal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the \nappropriate Office of the \nDistrict Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for possible \ninvestigation and prosecution. \nD. Confidentiality/Privacy \nThe Program is confidential.1  By filing a claim with the \nProgram, the Claimant or her Legal \nRepresentative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by \nthe Claimant pursuant to \nthe Program will \nbe used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her \ndesignees only for the \nfollowing purposes: \n1) \nProcessing and evaluating the Claimant's \nclaim; \n2) Administering the \nProgram and other Program-related work; and \n3) Reports to law \nenforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims. \nWhen documents \nor other information maintained or submitted by the Estate \nbecome part of a \nClaimant's file for \npurposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the \nAdministrator to \nassist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise \nremain confidential. No information \nprovided by \nClaimants will be provided to the Estate except for the \nClaimant's name and the date(s) \nand \nlocation(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing \nand evaluating the claim and, \nfor \npurposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom \nor by whom the Claimant \nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. \nThe Estate has agreed that no information obtained \nsolely through the Program will be disclosed \npublicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any \nclaim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not \navailable for inspection, review or copying by \nthe Estate or the Claimant or \nher representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent \nI   All parties agree that \nthey are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of \nIndividual claims \nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to \nconfidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent \nprivileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law. \n8iPage \nEFTA00010059\n\nmediation privileges, \nsettlement privileges and \nother privileges \napply. \nTo protect the \nprivacy of Claimants \nparticipating in the \nProgram, all personal \ninformation provided by \nthe Claimant during \nthis process will be \nreturned or destroyed \nwithin one year after the \nconclusion of \nthe \nProgram. \nIndividual \nClaimants are not bound \nthrough the Program by any \nrules of \nconfidentiality. Claimants may, \nat their sole \nand voluntary option, \ndisclose information in \ntheir possession \nregarding their claim, their \ncompensation and their \nexperience with \nthe Program. \nAll confidentiality \nrequirements are \nsubject to law, \nregulation and judicial \nprocess. \nE. \nReporting \nThe \nAdministrator shall, on \na  monthly basis, \nconfidentially provide \nreports regarding the \nnumber and \ntotal \nvalue of claims paid each \nmonth to the Probate \nCourt of the United \nStates Virgin Islands and \nthe \nAttorney \nGeneral of the United \nStates Virgin Islands. \nSuch reports will \nreport on an aggregate \nlevel \nonly. No \nindividual Claimant \ninformation will be published \nor disclosed in a  way \nthat compromises \nClaimant \nconfidentiality. \n9IPage \nEFTA00010060",
