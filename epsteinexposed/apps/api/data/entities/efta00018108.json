Would you take a look when you can? \n- I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. \nWould you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized \nthe new stuff we're looking to share? \nThanks, \nEFTA00018108",
