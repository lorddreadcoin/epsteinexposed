I leftMas the affiant because I believe he \nswore out the most recent warrant, but let me know if I should switch it to Mandy instead. \nOur hope is to get this to Judge Gorenstein this afternoon and swear it out tomorrow. Whichever of you will be the \naffiant, would you please call me with any corrections/edits to the affidavit? You'll see there's one question in there from \nTed about whether we've seen any photos of Maxwell on the discs seized from the NY residence that I'm hoping you can \nhelp me answer. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York.
