I \njust made a few very small changes, and we should be good to go. Let's please post the following: \nJuly 16, \n2019 update: \nOn July 14, 2019, an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing was held in the case of United States u. \nGhislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN). The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the Superseding Indictment. \nThe court announced its ruling that the defendant will be incarcerated pending trial. The Court scheduled \ndiscovery and motion deadlines for counsel as well as a trial date of July 12, 2021, before the Honorable Alison J. \nNathan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall United States \nCourthouse, 4o Foley Square, New York, New York, in Courtroom 906. No next conference was scheduled at this \nappearance. \nSeparately, currently on the home page we have a box for the Epstein case, that's a link to the updates and also \ninformation on where to call with information. Could we please change that to the Maxwell case? So exact same \nlanguage, just change the case heading to the one for Maxwell, above, and switch \"Jeffrey Epstein\" to \"Ghislaine \nMaxwell\" — so that if people just go to our main website, they can easily see where the updates are. Thank youll \nFrom \nUSANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, July 15, 2020 21:49 \nTo: \n) \nCc: USANYS) [Contractor] de: \nSubject: Maxwell VW Page \nShould we be updating to the page to reflect yesterday's hearing and order? Let me know if this works: \nJuly 14, 2019 \nupdate: \nOn July 14, 2019, the initial conference, arraignment, and bail hearing were held in the case of United States \nu. \nGhislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN).
