Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. \nShe asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process \nquestions, and I anticipate declining to comment anyway. \nDo we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a  hard time hearing during the call, but my \nimpression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks. \nSpokesman \nUnited States Department of Justice \nEFTA00029455\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office I Southern District of New York \nEFTA00029456",
