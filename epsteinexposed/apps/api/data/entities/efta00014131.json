I hate the idea of writing yet another \nletter that will be attached to a pleading or quoted in the paper. \nI would feel more comfortable with something that says: \nThank you for your letter. The Office is involved in the criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein and is neither a party to nor \ninvolved in any civil suits against him. If you have any documentary evidence thatyou believe establishes a breach of the \nNon-Prosecution Agreement, you can forward that evidence to AUS The Office will then conduct its \nown review in accordance with the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. \nAnd leave it at that. What do you all think? \nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSent: Tue Nov 04 10:56:20 2008 \nSubject: Draft Response to Edwards' Oct 15, 2008 letter \nAttached please find my draft response to Edwards' Oct 15, 2008 letter. Please ensure that it is factually \ncorrect, particularly with regard to what Epstein agreed to during the negotiations. Thanks. \nEFTA00014131\n\n<<edwards_respfir_101508.wpd>> \nEFTA00014132",
