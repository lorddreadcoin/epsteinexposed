OIG has made a couple of \nrequests and I wanted to provide them the report so they can appropriately reply to the AUSAs. I have never seen the \nEFTA00023014\n\nreport and wasn't sure who maintained it because does not have it either. \nSince I am no longer at NYM, if you feel more comfortable replying to OIG directly (attached), I understand. I just want to \nensure we are responsive to the request so as not to cause any issue with the ongoing legal proceedings. \nThanks for your help. \nEFTA00023015",
