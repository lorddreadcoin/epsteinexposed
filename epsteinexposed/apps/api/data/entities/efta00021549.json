Thus our request. If the government won't consent then, we will serve you via email and hold off filing it \nuntil we can get the court to rule. \nGarden City, NY 11530 \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.

We'd ask that, consistent with the protective order, any sensitive discovery and \nreferences to cooperators be redacted in your public filings. Along the same lines, we noticed that you publicly filed four \ndocuments that were marked sensitive (Exhibits A through D to your cell site motion) in violation of the protective order. \nWe will be asking the Court to remove them from the docket and you will need to refile. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, August 2, 201911:33 AM \nTo: MM, \n(USANYS)  \naN> \nCc: \nEFTA00021549\n\nSubject: RE: motions under seal? \nI don't think that will satisfy our concern about revealing the statements and certainly not something we can do today or \neasily. Nor do I want the extra work. \nGarden City, NY 11530 \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.

Out of an abundance of caution, can you \nfile the documents with any reference to evidence/discovery and cooperators redacted? We can then review the \nunredacted version and discuss what, if anything, can be unredacted for the public version. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, August 2, 2019 11:03 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: motions under seal? \nOur motions will be ready to go out in a few hours., One is straight forward legal argument about the cell tower data, \nwhich we don't have a problem filing. The other motion deals with the statements to the police and by necessity we \ndiscuss the statements in detail. We also discuss some of the discovery and the cooperating witnesses. What is the \nGovernment position about filing that motion under seal? \nAlso, affidavit hasn't been signed because the only regular access to a notary are members of his legal team and we \ndon't want to witness his signature. We will have him sign it through whatever the process is at MCC or in open court at \nour next appearance. \nEFTA00021550\n\nGarden City, NY 11530 \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.
