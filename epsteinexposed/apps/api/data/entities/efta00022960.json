Overview \nDocket Entries (\"DEN\") 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 (\"Sealed \nMaterial[s]\" \nor \"Sealed \nItem[s]\") have been selected by the Court, with respect to Does 1 and 2, to begin the process of \nindividualized review of these selected Sealed Materials to determine (a) the weight of \npresumption of public access that should be afforded to an item, (b) the identification and weight \nof any countervailing interests supporting continued sealing/redaction of the item, and (c) whether \nthe countervailing interests rebut the presumption of public access to the item. Giuffre v. Maxwell, \nNo. 15-CV-07433-LAP, 2020 WL 1547377, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020); DE 1044.' Based on \nthe Court's clarification of its March 31, 2020 Order, DE 1053, (\"the Protocol\"), Non-Parties \nDoes I  and 2 have been served with the approved Notice and, pursuant to the Protocol, additional \nNon-Parties will be notified prior to any unsealing of the selected Sealed Materials. \nDoes 1  and 2 did not respond to the Notice. The absence of a response, however, does not \nend the analysis. Although the Court's Protocol requires consideration of objections from the \nother Non-Parties yet to be noticed, the Court could (and should) determine, based on the \ncircumstances of the Sealed Materials selected here, that the items are appropriately sealed \nwithout the need for additional Non-Party objections. \n' Pursuant to paragraph 2.g of the Order \"any memorandum in support of a ... Party \nObjection to unsealing a particular Sealed Item shall be no longer than 6 double-spaced pages in \n12 point, Times New Roman Font. Ms. Maxwell has lodged objections to the identified \ndocuments in 14 pages in compliance with the Order, i.e., this pledge is one-half of the authorized \nlength. \nI \nEFTA00022964\n\nCasgaP.67434.94neDiAgrheAF11?04lEheigg/h.V2ea504eY-Of 17 \nApplying the three-part analysis set forth by the Court in its March 31, 2020 Order to the \nselected Sealed Materials in Des 143, 172, and 1992 results in a determination that: (a) the \nselected Sealed Materials relate solely to five-year-old discovery disputes and therefore, at most, \nbegin with a presumption of public access \"somewhat lower than the presumption applied to \nmaterial introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions such as motions for \ndismissal or summary judgment.\" Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 50 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing \nUnited States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"Amodeo II\")); (b) any minimum \npresumption of public access is subject to many countervailing interests supporting continued \nsealing; and (c) the countervailing interests rebut any minimal presumption of public access. \nIL DE 143 and Related DEs 142, 144, 144-1-7, 149, 150, 150-1, 151, 152, 153, and 153-1 \nare afforded the lowest presumption of public access and these Sealed Materials \nshould remain sealed. \nThis series of pleadings concerns Plaintiff's attempt to compel Ms. Maxwell to answer \nintrusive questions about her sex life.' DE 143 quotes extensively, selectively, and misleadingly \nfrom Ms. Maxwell's first seven-hour deposition. DE 144-1-7 contains 7 exhibits: 1, 2, and 4-7 are \n2  As discussed in Sections VII at VIII, infra, consideration of DEs 164 and 230 is \npremature at this time. \n'DE 142 is a letter notice; DE 143 is the initial motion; DE 144 is a lawyer \ndeclaration referencing the exhibits in DE 144-1-7. The declarations accompanying the \nvarious Sealed Materials often identify a Non-Party. The Court may wish to simply redact \nall of the Non-Party names from the declarations as a means of streamlining review and \nNotice problems. DE 149 is Defendant's Response, 150 is a lawyer declaration \nreferencing the exhibit in DE 150-1. DE 151 is another letter notice. DE 152 is Plaintiff's \nReply. DE 153 is another lawyer declaration referencing the exhibits in DE 153-1-7. The \nname of Doe 1 appears in DEs 152, p. 6 and 153 p. 2 11 7 and 8. Doe 2 does not appear in \nany DE 143 related pleading. \nThe following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 143 references 2 non-parties; \nDE 144-1-7 references 7 non-parties; DE 150-1 references 9 non-parties. \n2 \nEFTA00022965\n\nCasgaflgel'43g-'19\\frneDIAgnieRik%?04fileifithcliElV26aintbe'Wth 17 \nexcerpts from Ms. Maxwell's deposition. Exhibit 3 contains pages from the Palm Beach Police \nReport. DE 149 is Ms. Maxwell's response to DE 143. \nPage 2 of DE 149 contains a summary of Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony. DE 150-1 \ncontains pages of Ms. Maxwell's deposition necessary to place Plaintiff's submission into \ncontext. DE 153 is Plaintiff's reply which, again quotes from Ms. Maxwell's deposition and \nreferences numerous Non-Parties. DE 153-1 contains 7 exhibits. Exhibit I  is a portion of Ms. \nMaxwell's deposition. Exhibit 2 contains a \"Flight Log Summary Chart\" prepared by Plaintiff's \ncounsel and flight logs that contain the names of numerous Non-Party Does. Exhibit 3 purports to \nbe 88 pages of Palm Beach Police Reports, some redacted, some unredacted, with multiple \nreferences to Non-Party Does. Exhibit 4 and 7 are inadmissible hearsay transcripts from an \nunreliable deceased individual never deposed by Ms. Maxwell. Exhibits 5 and 6 concern J. Doe I. \nIII. DE 143, DE 144-1, exhibits 1, 2, and 4-7; DE 149, page 2, summary of Ms. Maxwell's \ndeposition testimony; DE 150-1; DE 153; and DE 153-1: Identification of \nCountervailing Interests. \nA. Countervailing Interests. \nAll of the above DEs are either quotes from, summaries of, or portions of transcripts from \nMs. Maxwell's deposition in this case. The subject matter of these DEs is extremely personal, \nconfidential, and subject to considerable abuse by the media. Countervailing interests include: \n1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (\"CI-1\"). \nIf a party or nonparty provides information in connection with a lawsuit in reasonable reliance \nupon a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) protective order, the information must remain \nsealed. See Martindell v. Intl TeL & TeL Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 296 (2d Cir. 1979); see id. at 297-\n98 (Medina, J., concurring) (noting \"overriding policy in favor of enforcing the civil protective \norder against federal prosecutor's request for deposition transcripts\", and holding \"[A] plaintiff in \na civil litigation is bound by the terms of an agreement he has made to restrict the access of non-\n3 \nEFTA00022966\n\ncasair.€1.g-\n61743g-cncrnenbegrheRFiliW4(lielf3\n@t§h.V26a \nparties, including the Government, to the products of discovery. This was the essence of Judge \nFrankel's decision in GAF Corp. v.  Eastman Kodak Co., 415 F.Supp. 129 (S.D.N.Y.1976), with \nwhich I fully concur.\") (footnote omitted). Martindeli was cited with approval in SEC v. \nTheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 232 (2d Cir. 2001), which was cited with approval in Brown, 929 \nF.3d at 51 n.40. Notably the Second Circuit in Brown held that redactions of sensitive, private \ninformation disclosed by witnesses in depositions because of \"a strong expectation of continued \nconfidentiality, \" Brown, 929 F.3d at 48 n.22, and the Second Circuit itself redacted sensitive \npersonal references in Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony excerpts. \nMs. Maxwell was the Defendant in this defamation action. She did not inject her personal \nlife into this case and was deposed under a court-ordered guarantee that her testimony would \nremain confidential. She relied on that order and has a strong expectation of continued \nconfidentiality. \n2. Prevention \nof the abuse of court records and flies (\"CI\n-2\"). \nCourts must exercise their supervisory power over their own records and files to ensure \nthey \"are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal\" or \"serve as reservoirs of \nlibelous statements for press consumption.\" Brown, 929 F.3d at 51 (quoting Nixon v. Warner \nCommens, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978)). The Brown court held: \"District courts should \nexercise the full range of their substantial powers to ensure their files do not become vehicles for \ndefamation. Id. at 53. The above DE's are textbook examples of materials that should not be \nsubmitted to courts because of their potential for abuse. \n3. Annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (\"CI-3\"). \nMaterials that cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden to an \nindividual should be sealed or redacted. See Brown, 929 F.3d at 51. The questions were intrusive \nand embarrassing. \n4 \nEFTA00022967\n\ncasQair.q.§&61'43g49411enbegnieAFiliW4clieVdt§h.V2ea \n'ea \nef62(9f  17 \n4. Preserving the fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal \ninvestigation (\"CI-4\"). \nThe preservation of the fundamental rights of suspects and others under criminal \ninvestigation is a powerful countervailing interest weighing against the presumption of access. \nSee Nixon, 435 U.S. at \n595, 602; Brown, 929 F.3d at 47 n.13; Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295-97. The \ncourts have an obligation to safeguard the integrity of criminal investigations and the privacy and \nsafety of witnesses and suspects that are part of those investigations. United States v. Longueuil, \n567 F. App'x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that district court properly sealed contested \ndocuments \"as they reflected sensitive information about cooperating witnesses, \"and concluding \nthat sealing was justified in part \"to safeguard the privacy of individuals involved in an \ninvestigation\"; \"[t]tle district court was in the best position to weigh these factors\") (internal \nquotations and citation omitted); Hardy, 697 Fed. App'x at 725 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that courts \nhave found that the following can defeat presumption of access: protection of ongoing \ninvestigations, safety of witnesses, national security, and trade secrets). \nMs. Maxwell is aware, based on publicly reported statements by Plaintiff, Plaintiff's \ncounsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the Attorney \nGeneral for the U.S. Virgin Islands, that investigations surrounding the alleged conduct of Mr. \nEpstein survive his death. It is unclear who are witnesses or targets of any investigation. These \nongoing investigations are a powerful countervailing interest here. The sealed testimony or \nsummaries may inappropriately influence potential witnesses or alleged victims. \nIV. DE 144-1- Exhibit 3 (police reports); DE 153; DE 153- Exhibit 2 \"Flight Log \nSummary Chart\" prepared by Plaintiff's counsel and flight logs; Exhibit 3 (88 pages \nof police reports): Identification of Countervailing Interests. \nNumerous yet to be notified Non-Party Does are mentioned in these documents and it is \npremature for the Court to make any decision to unseal these documents prior to Notice. \n5 \nEFTA00022968\n\nCacengCbkrildaSEAPerniguiaiii002PilggiffM412ba9eageot 17 \nHowever, these materials are subject to the following countervailing interests regardless of \nadditional Non-Party objections: \nA. Countervailing Interests \n1. Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). \nBrown, 929 F.3d at 51and 53, see section III.A.2, supra. \n2. Improper submission of documents (\"CI-5\"). \nDocuments that a party has submitted for a non-merits purpose, e.g., the confidentiality, \ndiscoverability or admissibility of information, should remain sealed or redacted if there is any \ninterest in sealing or redaction. See TheSreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233. The references to the various \nattached exhibits were gratuitous and served no legitimate purpose related to the discovery \ndispute. During the course of this litigation Plaintiff offered, on more than one occasion, various \niterations and compilations of the Palm Beach Police Reports in which no one identified Ms. \nMaxwell as a suspect, a perpetrator, or participant. The attachment of alleged summaries of flight \nlogs, alleged flight logs, and police reports was simply a mechanism to attempt to bias the Court \nand any potential future reader of the material. These issues were briefed in various undecided \nmotions in limine. \n3. Untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information (\"CI-6\"). \nCourts should continue the sealing or redaction of information that is or may be \nuntrustworthy, hearsay or incorrect or that simply is misinformation. United States v. Amodeo, 71 \nF.3d 1044, 1052 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"Amedeo Ill (\"The nature of some parts of the Report militate \nagainst unsealing, however. Portions of the Report are hearsay, and may contain misinformation. \nThere is a strong possibility that the report will contain material which is untrustworthy or simply \nincorrect.\") (internal quotations, brackets, citation and ellipsis omitted). Exhibits 4 and 7 are \ninadmissible hearsay transcripts from an unreliable deceased individual never deposed by Ms. \n6 \nEFTA00022969\n\nCagerlg0atifildao€AIDerbdalfrigiq i0502PilgRibnt5/2fetagiitidect?g 17 \nMaxwell. The exhibits could not be considered evidence and should not have been submitted to \nthe Court. The declarant suffered multiple felony convictions and had been involved in attempting \nto obtain money from one of Plaintiff's lawyers in exchange for alleged evidence. These issues \nwere briefed in various undecided motions in limine. \nV. DE 153-1 exhibits 4 and 7 and DE 153-1, exhibits 5 and 6: Identification of \nCountervailing Interests \nA. Countervailing Interests \n1. Untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information (CI-6). \nExhibits 5 and 6 concern J. Doe I. Both exhibits are hearsay statements made by J. Doe 1 \nin proceedings that did not involve Ms. Maxwell. J. Doe 1 was not examined by Ms. Maxwell's \ncounsel in that proceeding making the statements unreliable and inadmissible. \nVI. DE 172 (and related DEs 171, 173, 173-1, 189, 190, 190-1, 202, 203, 204-1, 211, 212, \n212-1, and 224) are afforded the lowest presumption of public access and this Sealed \nMaterial should remain sealed. \nThese pleadings concern what should have been a straightforward request by Plaintiff to \nexceed the presumptive 10 deposition limit set by the Court? It was not. Instead of simply asking \nto exceed the presumptive limit, Plaintiff felt the urge to pack the record with deposition \ntestimony subject to the Protective Order and references to multiple Non-Party Does including \ndeposition testimony from Non-Party Does!' \n5 DE 171 is a letter notice; DE 172 is the initial motion; DE 173 is a lawyer declaration \nreferencing the exhibits in DE 173-1. DE 189 is Defendant's Response, 190 is a lawyer \ndeclaration referencing the exhibit in DE 190-1. DE 202 is another letter notice. DE 203 is \nPlaintiff's Reply. DE 204 is another lawyer declaration referencing the exhibits in DE 204-1. \nDEs 211, 212, 212, 212-1 and 224 are amended/corrected versions of DEs 202, 203, and 204-1. \nThe name of Doe 1 appears in DEs 172, pp. i, 2, 6, 11, and 12; 173 p. 2 if 5 and 10; 173-6 pp. 71, \n73, and 218; 189 p. 6; 203, pp. 2, and 5-6, 204, p. 115 ; 204-3, all; 211, see 203; 212, see 204; \n212-3, see 204-1:3; 224, see 203. Doe 2 appears in DEs 172, pp. i, 2, and 12; and 189 p.5. \n6  The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 172 references 14 non-parties; \nDE 173-1 references 47 non-parties; DE 189 references 8 non-parties; DE 203 references 12 non-\n7 \nEFTA00022970\n\nCaccang0a4/714A3P_APereiguiaiiiM02PilgaiffMolga9ead€045?ii 17 \nGiven the repeated references to Non-Parties it is premature for the Court to make any \ndecision to unseal these documents prior to Notice. However, Countervailing interests exist that \nwarrant a decision to seal many of the Selected Materials regardless of any additional Non-Party \nobjections. \nA. Identification of Countervailing Interests \n1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4). \nDE 172 contains multiple references to Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony and the \ndeposition testimony of one other Non-Party taken pursuant to the Protective Order. See pp. 2, 4-8 \nas to Ms. Maxwell and pp. 3, 4, 9, and 11 as to an additional Non-Party Doe. Reasonable reliance \non a protective order by a party or non-party, Prevention of the abuse of court records and files, \nAnnoyance, embarrassment, oppression, undue burden, Preserving the fundamental rights of \nsuspects or others under criminal investigation, all identified in section III.A.1-4 apply to these \npages of DE 172. \n2. Non-Judicial Documents (\"CI-7\"). \nIn defining \"judicial records and documents,\" the Second Circuit \"ha[s] emphasized that \n`the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial \ndocument subject to the right of public access.\"' Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49 (2d Cir. \n2019) (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 \n(2d Cir. 1995) (\"Amodeo r')). Amodeo I, the inception of the Second Circuit's principle that a file \nstamp is not a judicial-document talisman, is instructive. There an appointed Court Officer tasked \nparties; DE 204-1 references 4 non-parties; DE 211 references 12 non-parties; DE 202 references \n2 non-parties; DE 202-1 references 2 non-parties; DE 224 references 8 non-parties. \n8 \nEFTA00022971\n\nCasaP.I.g-16?15t43/64ImeDbgtfieAF4W0414O§11/1,26aPtibc1CP-af 17 \nwith an investigation for the District Court for the Southern District of New York prepared and \nfiled with the court a sealed report of her investigation. Newsday moved to unseal the report. \nAfter the court released an edited and redacted copy of the report, Newsday appealed. See 44 F.3d \nat 142-43. \nIf its mere filing transformed the report into a judicial document, Amodeo I would have \nbeen categorical and succinct. It was neither. The decision turned on the Second Circuit's lengthy \ndiscussion of the First and Third Circuits' divergent approaches to the question, when is a mere \ndocument transformed into a judicial one? The Third Circuit's focus was \"`on the technical \nquestion of whether a document is physically on file with the court.\"' Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145 \n(quoting Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 782 (3d Cir. 1994)). In that circuit if a \ndocument is filed with a court, it is a judicial document; otherwise it is not. See id. (citing Pansy, \n23 F.3d at 782). The Amodeo I court cited two other Third Circuit cases confirming that circuit's \nlitmus-test approach to identifying judicial documents: Bank of America National Trust and \nSavings Association v. Hotel Rittenhouse Association, 800 F.2d 339, 344-45 (3d Cir. 1986) \n(\"Once a settlement is filed in the district court, it becomes a judicial record, and subject to the \naccess accorded such records.\"); Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., 998 F.2d \n157, 161-62 (3d Cir. 1993) (listing cases in which \"other courts have also recognized the principle \nthat the filing of a document gives rise to a presumptive right of public access\"). Amodeo 1, 44 \nF.3d at 145. \nThe First Circuit \"has taken a somewhat different approach,\" id. In that circuit \"documents \nmust have a role in the adjudication process in order to be accessible and . . . documents that have \nno such role, such as those used in discovery, cannot be reached.\" Id. (citing Anderson v. \nCryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1986)). Amodeo I found instructive \nF.T.C. \nv.

In \nF.T.C. \na district court relied upon \nfinancial records referenced in a proposed consent decree in deciding whether to approve the \ndecree. The First Circuit held the financial records were judicial documents because they were \nsubmitted to the court as part of the decree-approval process, they were \"'relevant and material\" \nto the process, and the district court \"relied upon the documents in assessing the reasonableness of \nthe order, i.e., in determining the litigants' substantive rights, and in performing its adjudicatory \nfunction.\" Id. (quoting \nF.T.C., \n830 F.2d at 410). \nThe Second Circuit adopted the First Circuit's approach: \nWe think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient \nto render that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We \nthink that the item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial \nfunction and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial \ndocument. \nId. Brown was building on Amodeo /'s holding when it said, \"As our precedent makes clear, a \ncourt \"`perform[s] the judicial function' ... when it rules on motions currently before it.\" Brown, \n929 F.3d at 49 (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting Arnodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145). And it \nwas building on Amodeo I when it said, \"A document is thus `relevant to the performance of the \njudicial function' if it would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court's ruling on \na motion ....\" Id. (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145). Both \nBrown accretions to the Amodeo I principle are themselves dependent upon the principle. If a \nmotion is not \"currently before\" the district court, then a fortiori the court is not \"perform[ing] the \njudicial function.\" And if a motion is not currently before the court, then a fortiori it cannot \n\"reasonably have [a] tendency to influence\" the court. \nBrown's holding was hardly a surprise. It followed S.E.C. v.  TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, \n233 (2d Cir. 2001). There the Second Circuit held that documents that \"did not `directly affect an \n10 \nEFTA00022973\n\nAirtlentoeCirheAFIUP4ielt36§5%,28a9%1Aclga 17 \nadjudication' nor ... significantly `determine litigants' substantive rights' were not judicial \ndocuments. (Brackets omitted; quoting United States v. Amodeo,71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. \n1995) \n(\"Amodeo II\").) \nDE 173, a declaration, references additional Non-Parties, generally those identified in \nlawyer emails. The Court may wish to defer consideration of this DE. Redaction of the names \nwould eliminate any issue related to this document. DE 173-1 exhibits 1-4 identify additional \nNon-Parties. Generally, these exhibits are a composite of various back and forth emails between \ncounsel which are hearsay, non-judicial, documents and which contain the identity of Non-Party \nDoes. This exhibit should not be considered a judicial document. The arguments of counsel in \nself-serving emails are generally not reliable evidence upon which any judicial decision rests or \nshould rest. \n3. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CM). \nUntrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information (CI-6). \nDE 172-1, exhibit 5, is an entire, 160-page, Non-Party deposition taken under the \nguarantee of the Protective Order entered in this case and should be sealed by application of the \ncountervailing interests identified in [] above. Similarly DE 172-1, exhibit 6 is the entire, 418-\npage, deposition of Ms. Maxwell taken under the guarantee of the Protective Order and should \nremain sealed based on the countervailing interests identified above. \nDE 172-1, exhibit 7, is yet another copy of the same 88 pages of police reports attached to \nmany other pleadings in this case. This exhibit should remain sealed for the reasons discussed in \nsection VI.A.2 and 3, supra. \nDE 172-1, exhibit 8, is an identical copy of J. Doe l's hearsay statement attached to DE \n153-1 and should be sealed for the same reasons discussed in section V.A.1. \nII \nEFTA00022974\n\ncasapiq-iiNgdtaagiviatnenbgitheAFRV04clieltVerAkeastilfrclf-Of 17 \n4. Non-Judicial Documents (CI-7) \nDE 172-1, exhibit 9, is additional counsel generated, self-serving correspondence that is \nnot a judicial document as discussed in section VI.A.2 above. \n5. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4). \nDE 189 is Defendant's response to the motion. Page 5 of the response contains a \nparagraph quoting the deposition testimony of a Non-Party taken pursuant to the Protective Order \nwhich should remain sealed because of countervailing factors CI-1 through CI-4. The remaining \nportions of that document can be unsealed, subject to any additional Non-Party objections. \nDE 190 and 190-1 relate to deposition testimony by Plaintiff. Ms. Maxwell has no \nobjection to unsealing these documents, subject to any Non-Party objections. \n6. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (O-4). \nDE 203, Plaintiff's reply, contains numerous quotes from the protected deposition \ntestimony taken from Non-Party Does and should remain sealed based on countervailing interests \ndiscussed above. \n7. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (O-4). \nDE 204 and 204-1 relate to the deposition testimony of three Non-Party Does including J. \nDoe 1. All of the references to the Non-Parties and the testimony should remain sealed based on \nthe countervailing interests discussed above. Exhibit 1  to DE 204 is the testimony of a J. Doe, yet \nto receive Notice, taken subject to the Protective Order which was relied on by the J. Doe. Exhibit \n12 \nEFTA00022975\n\nCasaP.1g$Ngeta3g4.91/41tneDbgtheAF1311W414130g1V2eagcttbc1if-af 17 \n2 to DE 204-1 is a \"rough\" transcript of a yet to be notice J. Doe also taken pursuant to the \nProtective Order. Exhibit 3 to DE 204-1 is deposition testimony taken of J. Doe I  pursuant to the \nProtective Order. Although J. Doe 1 has not responded to the notice, J. Doe I  made it clear in this \ndeposition that J. Doe 1 did not want any further involvement in this matter and that J. Doe 1 was \nunable to accurately recall details of the events described as a result of a medical condition. DEs \n211, 212, and 212-1 are the same as DEs 203, 201 and 204-1 and should be treated identically. \nVII. DE 199 (and related DEs 200, 200-1, 228, 229, 229-1, 248, 249, and 249-1) are \nafforded the lowest presumption of public access and this Sealed Material should \nremain sealed. \n1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). \nPrevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, \nembarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the \nfundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4) \nand Redactions of Names. \nThese pleadings relate to Plaintiff's request for additional time to complete the depositions \nreferenced in her pleadings related to her request for more depositions. Generally, the DEs \nreference Non-Party Does and refer in some instances to Non-Party deposition testimony taken \nunder the guarantees of the Protective Order. The Court, prior to unsealing the Sealed Materials, \nwill require the responses of yet to be notified Non-Party Does.' However, it appears that the \nvolume of Sealed Material in these DEs is minimal. The Court could determine that the Sealed \nMaterials remain sealed by application of countervailing interests CI-1 through CI-4. \nThe following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 228 references 14 non-parties; \nDE 229 references 5 non-parties; DE 229-1 references 33 non-parties; DE 248 references 17 non-\nparties; DE 249 references 9 non-parties; DE 249-1 references 18 non-parties. \n13 \nEFTA00022976\n\nCasqVtgrafita3g4.91/44eneDiggiheRiiWO4leVaggfrgaIntb%c1fe-af 17 \nVIII. DE 164 (and related DEs 165, 165-8, 185-3, 185-11, 185-14, 185-15). Should Remain \nSealed Pending Additional Non-Party Notice and Responses Pursuant to The \nProtocol. \nThe pleadings related to DE 164 concern discovery related to a waiver of Plaintiff's \nattorney client privilege as a result of her lawyers' extrajudicial conduct and statements and \nPlaintiff's statements in other matters.' Accordingly, these materials are afforded the lowest \npresumption of public access. However, Ms. Maxwell anticipates that, subject to any objections \nfrom, yet-to-be-noticed, Non-Party Does she has no objection to the release of these materials. \nRelease at this time is premature, because various Non-Parties may raise countervailing interests \nthat must be addressed by the Court pursuant to the Protocol, \nIX. DE 230 and (and related DEs 235, 235-5, 235-7, 235-11, 235-13). Should Remain \nSealed Pending Additional Non-Party Notice and Responses Pursuant to The \nProtocol. \nThe Pleadings related to DE 230 concern the reopening of Plaintiff's deposition. \nAccordingly, these materials are afforded the lowest presumption of public access10. However, \nMs. Maxwell anticipates that, subject to any objections from, yet-to-be-noticed, Non-Party Does \nshe has no objection to the release of these materials. Release at this time is premature, because \n8  DE 165 is a lawyer declaration referencing the exhibit DE165-8; DE 185-3 is a Response \nto Motion to Intervene; DE 185-11 are pgs. from Plaintiff's deposition; DE 185-14 are pages from \none of Plaintiff's lawyers' deposition; DE 185-15 is an interview between Plaintiff and two of her \nlawyers. \n9  The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 165 references 1 non-party; \nDE 165-8 references 1 non-party; DE 185-3 references 12 non-parties; DE 185-11 references 8 \nnon-parties; DE 185-14 references 1  non-party; DE 185-15 references 15 non-parties. \nDE 235 is a redacted lawyer declaration referencing a non-party and exhibits DE 235-5, \n235-7, 235-11, 235-13.; DE 235-5 contains letters between counsel; 235-7 is an expert from a \nnon-party deposition, 235-11 is a privilege log; 235-13 is an errata sheet from a deposition. \n14 \nEFTA00022977\n\nCasaPEI-gsgdt43gitlAimeOtoegrfieAlila04140eigkeaPtlec1e-61f 17 \nvarious Non-Parties may raise countervailing interests that must be addressed by the Court \npursuant to the Protocol.\" \nX.
