The Warden is preparing the formal letter for the Court, in which your office, the USMS, USPO, and \nlead counsel are cc'ed.

When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can \npass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? \nI understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the \nBOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. \nEFTA00024356\n\nThank you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43, \n> \nwrote: \nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information \nin the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic \nfacts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. \nPlease advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get \nthat information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information \nthan the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nOn \nAug 10, 2019, at 08:46,5-( \n> \nwrote: \nPassed away.
