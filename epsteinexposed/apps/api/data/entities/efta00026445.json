These \nare basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant investigative costs \n(e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a super quick Epstein \nwrite up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today— sorry for the short notice)? \nI've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). \nAlso, notwithstanding what the form says, \nplease do NOT email it down to DC —  please send it back to me. \nThanks, \nEFTA00026445",
