Worse, he was told that if \ndoes not enter the tier where he believes he is in danger he will be sent to SHU. This is deeply troubling. MCC has kept \nMr. Tartaglione in quarantine for more than twice as long as he was supposed to be there and is now giving him the \nHobson's choice of SHU or risking his safety. And, his most of his property is still in the old cell where you assured us he \nwould be returned. \nI am again asking that he be placed on a safe tier, in a safe cell with a cellmate who does not pose a threat to him, \npreferably the cell where he has been detained for well over a year. \nBruce A.

As I wrote \nover the weekend, apparently the MCC refused to place Mr. Tartaglione back in his cell where he has been safe or in a unit \nof people over few years old. He is a retired police officer. As such he has been and is targeted for violence by other \ninmates. Prior to being housed with his current cellmate, Mr. Tartaglione was assaulted resulting in surgery and an \nextended stay in a hospital. For coming up on two years he has lived in a cell with a cellmate and has been relatively safe. \nHe was removed—supposedly for 14 days—over a month ago from that cell and is now being forced to either stay in \nEFTA00032123\n\nquarantine or be placed in a cell with a  new cellmate where he may not be safe. We understood from you that he would \nbe returned to the cell where he has lived in relative safety after quarantine. \nCan you please take the steps necessary to make sure Mr. Tartaglione is released from quarantine and placed in a cell that \nis safe?
