The one issue I have \nconcern about is Mr. Epstein's contention or assertion that by \ndefending against the allegations in the civil proceedings, he \nTOTAL \nACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014195\n\nCase 9:08-cv 80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 5 of 51 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmay expose himself to an allegation by the United States in the \nnon-prosecution agreement that he's violated that agreement and \ntherefore would subject himself to potential federal charges. \nI had asked for some briefing on this. I asked the \nUnited States to present its position to me. And I received \nthe Government's written response, which I frankly didn't find \nvery helpful. And I still am not sure I understand what the \nGovernment's position is on it. \nSo first let me hear from Mr. Epstein's attorneys as \nto what do you believe the concern is. I don't believe the \nnon-prosecution agreement has ever been filed in this Court; am \nI correct? \nMR. CRITTON: To my knowledge, Your Honor, it has not. \nTHE COURT: So I don't believe I've ever seen the \nentire agreement. I've seen portions of it. \nMR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, I believe that it was filed \nunder Jane Doe 1 and 2 vs. United States of America, case under \nseal in  your court. \nTHE COURT: Okay. \nMR. EDWARDS: In a separate case. \nTHE COURT: In that case, okay. Was it actually filed \nin that case? \nMR.

CRITTON: \nRobert Critton. \nYour Honor, our position on this case is, I'd say is \nsomewhat \ndifferent. When this issue originally came before the \nCourt, as you are aware \nprior to my firm's involvement in the \ncase, there was a motion filed on \nbehalf of Mr. Epstein seeking \na stay. And I think it was in \nJane Doe 102 and then \nsubsequently Jane Doe 2 through 5 because all of those cases \nwere filed on or about the same time. \nAnd at that time the Court looked at the issue and it \nwas based upon a statutory provision at that time. And \nthe \nCourt said I don't find that it's \napplicable, or for whatever \nreason \nI think the Court said I don't consider that to be a \npending proceeding or a proceeding at that particular time. \nIn that same order, \nwhich was in Jane Doe 2, I \nbelieve it's -- \nnot I believe, I know it's docket entry 33, the \nCourt also went on to talk about at that particular point in \ntime \ndealt with the issue of the discretionary stay. \nAnd the Court said at that time, I'm \nparaphrasing, but \nthe Court also \ndoes not believe a discretionary stay is \nwarranted. And what \nthe Court went on to say is that if \ndefendant does not breach the agreement, then he should \nhave no \nconcerns regarding his Fifth Amendment right against \nself-incrimination. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014197\n\nCase 9:08-cv 80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 7 of 51 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe fact that the U.S. Attorney or other law \nenforcement officials may object to some discovery in these \ncivil cases is not in and of itself a reason to stay the civil \nlitigation, so that any such issue shall be resolved as they \narise in \nthe course of the litigation. \nAnd I would respectfully submit to the Court that the \nposition that the Government has taken in its most recent \nfilings changes the playing field dramatically. Because what \nthe Government in essence has said as distinct from the U.S. \nsaying is, \nwell, we object to some discovery, or we may object \nto some discovery in the civil cases. \nWhat they have, in essence, said is if you take some \naction, Mr. Epstein, \nthat we believe unilaterally, and this is \non pages 13 and 14 of \ntheir pleading or of their response memo \nto the Court's inquiry, they say if Mr. Epstein breaches the \nagreement. They said it's basically like a contract, and if \none side breaches, the other side can sue. \nIn this \ninstance what the Government will do is if we \nbelieve that Mr. Epstein has breached the agreement, we'll \nindict him. We will indict him. And his \nremedy under that \ncircumstance, which is \nan incredible and catastrophic catch 22 \nis, we'll indict him and then he \ncan move to dismiss. That's a \ngreat option. \nIn this particular \ninstance my mandate in defending --\nand that's a dramatic change in the Government's position, \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014198\n\nCase 9:08-cv 80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 8 of 51 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbecause the Government is not saying, and the Court was pretty \nspecific in what you asked the \nGovernment for in its response \nis, in essence, and it's the same question in a more limited \nfashion you're posing today is whether \nMr. Epstein's defense of \nthe civil action \nviolates the NPA agreement, the \nnon-prosecution agreement, between the U.S. and Mr. \nEpstein. \nAnd the Government refuses to answer that question. \nThey won't come out and say, yes, it will, or \nno, it won't. \nWhat they're doing is they want to sit on the sideline, and as \ntheir papers suggest is, they want us to lay in wait and that \nif, in fact, they believe he violates a provision of the NPA as \nit relates to the defense of this case or these multitude of \ncases, then they can come in and \nindict him -- no notice, no \nopportunity to cure. \nWe \ndon't think that's what the NPA says, but that's \ncertainly what their papers say. We'll indict him, no notice, \nno opportunity to cure. We \nwill indict him, and his remedy \nunder that circumstance is that he can move to dismiss the \nindictment. \nWell, that's great except Mr. Epstein, his mandate to \nme and I know his mandate to his criminal lawyers, is: \nMake \ncertain I don't do anything, in \nparticular in these civil cases \nthat would in any way \nsuggest that I am in willful violation of \nthe NPA. \nNow, in the Court's prior ruling in the docket entry \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014199\n\nCase 9:08-cv 80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 9 of 51 9 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n33, certainly some aspects of the NPA are within Mr. Epstein's \ncontrol. There's no question about that. But aspects that \nrelate to the defense of these cases, either in terms of the \ncivil lawyers who are defending these, I think there's 12 or 13 \npending cases in front of you, \nthere's another four cases in \nthe state court, is the risk is \nsubstantial, it's real, and it \npresents a \nchilling effect for the civil lawyers in moving \nforward to determine whether or not we're taking some action \nthat in some way may be \na violation of the NPA. \nAnd the Government's, again, refusal or non-position \nwith regard to past acts that have been taken in the civil \ncase \nwith regard to the defense or future acts that we may take with \nregard to these contested litigation casts an extraordinary \ncloud of doubt and uncertainty and fear that the defense of \nthese cases could jeopardize Mr. Epstein \nand put him in the \nirreparable position \nof violating the NPA and then subsequently \nbeing \nindicted. \nIn \nthis particular instance, again, Mr. Epstein has no \nintention of willfully violating the \nNPA, but it's of great \nconcern to him. And I'd \nsay with the position that the \nGovernment has taken, no \nnotice, no cure period, no opportunity \nto discuss. Again, we think \nthat's not what the NPA provides, \nit's not what the deal was between the two contracting parties, \nthe United States and Mr. Epstein. But that's clearly what \ntheir papers say under the \ncircumstances, and it would create \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014200\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06;24:2009 Page 10 of 51 10\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthis irreparable harm to Mr. Epstein under the circumstances. \nIn essence, we're left with a \ncatch 22 in defending \nthe civil cases. We have a mandate to take no action, to take \nany action which may be deemed to be a violation of the NPA, \neither in the past or in the future, which would in any way \nrisk Mr. Epstein \nbeing indicted by the United States. \nHe has \nthe clear risk of an indictment based upon the \npapers that the Government filed. It's real, it's not remote, \nand it's not speculative. It chills the action of the defense \nin this \ninstance of both Mr. Epstein and his attorneys in \ntrying to defend these cases and decide under the circumstances \ncan we do this, can we take this position with regard to \ndepositions, can we take this legal position with regard to \nmotions to dismiss, with regard to responses, with regard to \nreplies? \nAnd we send out paper discovery. Is this in some way \nif we contact someone who may be an associate of these \nindividuals as part of our investigation, is that potentially \nin any way a violation of the NPA? Again, we don't think so. \nAnd, obviously, again, my \ndirection has been from my \nclient: \nDon't take any action that would result in me being \nindicted under the NPA. Well, that's great. But, generally, \ncivil lawyers or civil lawyers in defending a personal \ninjury \ncase or a tort case, which is exactly what these \nare, and from \na practical standpoint, we use various tools to do discovery. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014201\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 11 of 51 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThey're standard. They're specific. They're \nvery temporary. \nVery typical. \nBut in this instance, as the Court knows, things are \nnot typical with regard to this case in any way, shape or \nform. \nWe can't even serve subpoenaes, there's objections and there's \n-- we can't even serve objections to third parties so we can \nobtain documents unless we have to filter it through the \nplaintiffs' \nattorneys. They won't allow us to use their \nclients' names, even in a subpoena that would never be filed in \nthe \ncourt. \nHow do we do a deposition of a third party? We wanted \nto take the deposition of Jane Doe 4. \nWell, who is she? Well, \nwe can't tell you that. Well, who's the \ndefendant? Well, we \ncan't tell you that because nobody wants anybody to know \nanything about the case. They want to present it strictly \nthrough \nrose-colored glasses. \nAnd in this particular instance, we \nsimply can't \ndefend this case or take certain action with the spector \nhanging \nover us that, in fact, the Government may deem it to be \na violation of \nthe NPA, because very clearly in their response \npapers, they don't say. They say we don't take the position, \nand then they take a substantial position is we think \nthere's \nnot all that substantial factors that would entitle him to a \nstay. \nExcept for the one major issue which the Court posed \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014202\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 12 of 51 12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nin the question is, is can he defend \nthese cases? That's what \nI really want \nto know. Can he defend these cases and, in \nessence, what he has done in the past or what his defense team \nhas done in the past and what they're going to do in the \nfuture, can you give him, Epstein, assurances that the \nGovernment \nunder this situation, whatever he does, based on \nadvice of counsel, that that cannot be a \nwillful violation of \nthe NPA, which they can -- \nthey, the U.S. -- can then turn \naround and say that's a violation of the agreement and, \ntherefore, we're going to go proceed to indict you under the \ncircumstances. \nOur position is, Your Honor, is that the U.S. has now \ncavalierly suggested that, as they did in picking up on the \ncourt's docket entry or prior \norder, is, look, compliance with \nthe NPA is solely up to Mr. Epstein. In this type of \nbalance \nof equities, it doesn't speak in favor of a stay. \nWell, that's great. And maybe that was the position \nback in '08, on August 5th of '08, when the issue came up in \nfront of the Court with regard to the initial stay. \nBut the Government's papers under these circumstances \nsuggested a very different set of \ncircumstances. Their own \nunilateral, which is the issue \nthat we argued in the motion for \nstay, is that the Government's position is that we can \nunilaterally indict this man if we think he's \nbreached the NPA. \nWe don't think \nthat's right, but we have no buffer \nTOTAL \nACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014203\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 13 of 51 13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbetween us and the Government. They'll say, and as the Court \nknows, the Government has substantial power. The Government \ndoes what it wants. Most of the time \nhopefully they're right. \nSometimes they make mistakes. \nBut in this \nparticular instance, my client has rights. \nWe think that there's notice provisions, we think there's cure \nprovisions under the \nNPA. That's not what their paper says \nunder \nthe circumstances. \nAnd what we'd like to know from the Government, and \nmaybe the answer is basically what the Court asks is, let the \nGovernment come forward today and say, based on the knowledge \nthat we have, or as of today's date, June 12th, 2009, we, the \nGovernment, agree that there is no set of circumstances, not \nthat we're not aware of, but as of today's date, there is \nnothing that exists that would be a violation \nof the NPA. \nTHE COURT: \nWell, that's way beyond what I'm \ninterested in. I don't know what Mr. Epstein may have done \noutside the context of defending this case that may constitute \na violation. And if he \nhas done something outside the context \nof \ndefending this case that's a violation, I don't care. \nThat's between the United States and Mr. Epstein. \nI'm only concerned about whether anything he does in \ndefending these civil actions is going to be a violation of the \nnon-prosecution agreement. If he has done something else, it's \nnone of my business, and I don't \ncare, and I'm not going to \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014204\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 14 of 51 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \neven ask the Government to give you an \nassurance that he hasn't \ndone anything that \nmight have violated the agreement up till \ntoday.

And \nthat's another issue that we have to deal with. \nSo I understand your position. \nBut has anyone suggested to you on behalf of the \nUnited States that there is something that you've done in \ndefending this case that they believe may or could be construed \nas a violation of the non-prosecution agreement?

For example, the fact \nthat you've wanted to take their -- \nI don't know if you've \nnoticed depositions or not in this case, but if you've sent \nnotice of taking deposition, if you sent requests for \nproduction of documents, if you sent interrogatories, if you \nissued third party subpoenas?

But you've made the suggestion, even \nbefore this \nbrief was filed, that defending the case was going \nto potentially result in an assertion or allegation that you \nbreached the non-prosecution agreement. \nSo what was it that caused you to make \nthat initial \nassertion?

If he \nwants to move to take depositions, interrogatories, production, \nand they are according to your rulings appropriate, not \ninvasive of the \nprivacy of someone, and they are relevant, then \nI don't know how those could in any way be violations of the \nagreement. \nWhat I find hypocritical is that there are two parts \nTOTAL \nACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014210\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/242009 Page 20 of 51 20 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nto the agreement \nthat I am a beneficiary of. One of them is \nthat he has agreed that on any action brought in \nthe 2255, he \nwill admit to \nliability. \nAnd I received on May 26 a motion to dismiss, \nwhich \nwe're prepared to respond to and disagree with, \nbut totally \ncontesting liability, saying that the statute doesn't apply \nbecause the girls are no longer \nminors and saying, and this is \nthe great one, saying that the predicate of the conviction \nunder \n2255 has not been satisfied. \nNow, the understanding that I have is the agreement \nbetween the Government and Mr. Epstein was that \nthe Government \ndesired to see these victims made whole, and wanted them to be \nin the \nsame position as if Mr. Epstein had been prosecuted and \npled or convicted. And they would be able to have the \npredicate of that criminal conviction, which just as a matter \nof \nliability would just be introduced as proof that he's done \nthis. \nThey, under the agreement, are supposed to admit to \nliability on limited \nsomething that's under 2255. He has \nfiled, but since there is no conviction, there can \nbe no civil \nsuit under \n2255, with which we disagree. But it is totally in \nopposite \nof the NPA. \nThe second part is there are many young ladies, and \nthis perhaps he can use this to his great advantage, who are \nhumiliated about this entire situation.

And he \nhas written us as of yesterday that he is under no obligation \nto pay our fees on settling cases. \nNow, those two matters, I believe, may be breaches. \nBut I am not asking this Court at this time to do anything \nabout them. Nor am I \ntelling the Government, I'm not running \nto the \nGovernment and saying indict him because I want you to \npressure him to do what he agreed to. \nI'm a third-party \nbeneficiary for that agreement, and \nI may move to enforce certain parts of it.

I have to decide this current \nmotion, and I just want to know \nwhat is going to happen if I \ndeny the stay in terms of Mr. Epstein's exposure under the \nnon-prosecution agreement.

That's not a problem. But the \nproblem is that these are not typical clients and this is not a \ntypical case. He has written in his pleadings that he wants to \npublish the names of these girls in the \nnewspapers so that \nother people may come forward to discuss their sexual \nactivities with these \ndifferent plaintiffs. That's not your \ntypical case. But are rulings that you'll make in this case, \nand they're not \npart of the NPA. \nAs far as my going to the Government is concerned, I \nfind it very \nuncomfortable for me to use the Government to try \nto pursue \nmy financial interest in litigation. And I know that \nMr. \nEpstein and his \ncounsel will make \nmuch ado about \nit. \nSo\nam not going to be running \nthere. \nHowever, if they start taking depositions regarding \nliability, I will \nconsider that to be a breach because they're \nsupposed to have admitted \nliability. \nTHE \nCOURT: But, again, I don't have the agreement and \nI don't remember reading the agreement. But \nwhat I'm being \ntold is the part of the agreement that admits \nliability is only \nas to a 2255 claim, and there are numerous other personal \ninjury \ntort claims other than 2255 claims. \nAnd there's a limit of damages on the 2255 claim, as I \nunderstand it, but I presume that all the \nplaintiffs are going \nto seek more than the limited or capped amount of damages in \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014214\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06,24/2009 Page 24 of 51 2 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe non\n-prosecution agreement as to the other claims. \nAnd so why aren't they entitled to defend and limit \nthe amount of damages that your client is seeking on the \nnon\n-2255 tort claims? \nMR. JOSEFSBERG: \nYour Honor, you are correct. On \nnon-2255 tort claims, they are permitted to do the defense, \nwhatever is appropriate. \nMy cases are pure 2255 on which \nliability under the \nagreement is supposed to be admitted. Now, as to the amount of \ndamages, there are legal issues that will be before you and \nunder the C.M.A. cases that are getting before you, as to \nwhether it is 50 or \n150. That has nothing to do with the NPA. \nThere \nare legal issues that are before you as to \nwhether it is per statute, per count or per incident or per \nplaintiff. Those have nothing to do with the NPA. There is no \namount in NPA. Those will be resolved. \nAnyone who has \nbrought a case that is outside of 2255, \nthe defense is permitted to contest liability under \nthe NPA. \nThat's no \nviolation. \nUnder the NPA \nif someone brought a case under just \n2255, Mr. Epstein, if he is \nto keep his word, cannot contest \nliability. And there \nwould no need to stay this. Because it \nis \na \nself-fulfilling agreement.

The NPA has no limitation on \nhis contesting damages \nabove \nthe minimum statutory amount. \nThe only thing that he has \ndone is in his actions of \nrefusing to pay for settling \ndefendants, and in his saying that \nhe has no liability under 2255, those appear to be contrary to \nwhat's in the NPA. \nBut I'm not in any position right now to claim a \nbreach, and I don't \nknow whether I'd be claiming a breach or \nenforcing it in front of you, suing him for \nfees, asking you to \nhave him admit liability, or complaining to the \nGovernment. \nAnd that's why I'm not \nthat helpful in this situation because I \nthink it's the \nGovernment's role. \nBut I do not waive the right to be a third\n-party \nbeneficiary because pursuant to my appointment, which was \nagreed to by Mr. \nEpstein, I and my clients have certain rights, \nand we want to \nenforce them. \nBut his defending this lawsuit will not in any way be \na violation.

That provision, as we understand \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014220\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06, 24.2009 Page 30 of 51 30 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nit, it doesn't relate to our clients. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. But, again, you're in agreement \nwith everyone else so far that's spoken on behalf of a \nplaintiff that \ndefending the case in the normal course of \nconducting discovery \nand filing motions would not be a breach? \nMR. HOROWITZ: Subject to your rulings, of course, \nyes. \nTHE COURT: \nThank you. \nAnyone else have anything to \nsay from the plaintiffs? \nMs. \n, if you would be so kind as to maybe \nhelp us out. I appreciate the fact that you're here, and I \nknow you're not a party to these cases and under no obligation \nto \nrespond to my inquiries. But as I indicated, it would be \nhelpful for me to understand the Government's position. \nMS. :  Thank you, Your Honor. And we, of \ncourse, are always happy to try to help the Court as much as \npossible. But we are not a party to any of these lawsuits, and \nin some ways we are at a disadvantage because we don't have \naccess. My access is limited to what's on Pacer. So I \ndon't \nreally know what positions Mr. Epstein may have taken either in \ncorrespondence or in discovery responses that aren't filed in \nthe case file. \nBut your first order was really just what do you think \nabout a stay, and then the second order related to this \nhearing \nand asked a much more \nspecific question, which is whether we \nTOTAL \nACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014221\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 31 of 51 3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbelieve that Mr. \nEpstein's defense was a breach of the \nagreement. \nAnd I've tried to review \nas many of the pleadings as \npossible. As you know, \nthey're extremely voluminous. And I \nhaven't been through all of them. But we do believe \nthat there \nhas been a breach in the filing that Mr. \nJosefsberg referred \nto, and contrary to Mr. Critton, we do understand that we have \nan obligation to provide notice, and we are providing notice to \nMr. \nEpstein today. \nThe pleading that we found to be in breach -- the \nnon-prosecution agreement, sought to do one \nthing, which was to \nplace the victims in the same position they would have been if \nMr. Epstein had been convicted of the federal offenses for \nwhich he was \ninvestigated. \nAnd that \nif he had been federally prosecuted and \nconvicted, the victims \nwould have been entitled to restitution, \nregardless of how long ago the crimes were committed, \nregardless of how old they were at the time, and how old they \nare today, or at the time of the \nconviction. \nAnd it also would have made them eligible for damages \nunder \n2255. \nAnd so our idea was, our hope was that we could set up \na system that would allow these victims to get that restitution \nwithout having to go through what civil litigation will expose \nthem \nto. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014222\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 32 of 51 32 \n1 \nYou have a \nnumber of girls who were very hesitant \n2  about even speaking to authorities about this because of the \n3  trauma that they have suffered and about the embarrassment that \n4  they were \nafraid would be brought upon themselves and upon \n5  their \nfamilies. \n6 So we did through the non\n-prosecution agreement tried \n7  to \nprotect their rights while \nalso \nprotecting their privacy. \n8  So, pursuant to the non-prosecution agreement -- on the \nother \n9  hand, we weren't \ntrying to hand them a jackpot or a key to a \n10 bank. It \nwas solely to sort of put them in that same position. \n11 So we developed this language that said if -- that \n12 \nprovided for an attorney to represent them. Most of the \n13 victims, as you know from the \npleadings, come from not wealthy \n14 \ncircumstances, may not have known any attorneys who would be in \n15 a position to \nhelp them. \n16 \nSo we went through the Special Master procedure that \n17 resulted \nin the appointment of Mr. Josefsberg, and the goal was \n18 that they would be able to try to negotiate with Mr. Epstein \n19 for a fair amount of restitution/damages. And if Mr. Epstein \n20 \ntook the position, which apparently he has, which is that the \n21 \n$50,000 \nor $150,000 floor under 2255 \nalso would be a \ncap. \nTn-t. \n22 if they were to \nproceed to file suit in Federal Court to get \n23 fair damages under 2255, Mr. \nEpstein would admit liability, but \n24 he, of course, could fight the damages portion, which means \n25 that, of course, he would be entitled to depositions; of \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014223\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 33 of 51 33 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncourse, he would be entitled to take \ndiscovery, and we don't \nbelieve that any of that violates the non-prosecution \nagreement. \nThe issue with the pleading that he filed, the motion \nto dismiss the case, I believe \nit's Jane Doe 101, represented \nby Mr. Josefsberg, is that that is a case that was filed \nexclusively under 18 U.S.C., Section 2255. She met that \nrequirement. Mr. Epstein is moving to \ndismiss it, not on the \nbasis of damages, he is saying that he cannot be held liable \nunder 2255 because he was not convicted of an offense. \nThe reason why he was not \nconvicted of an offense is \nbecause he entered into the non-prosecution agreement. So that \nwe do believe is a breach. \nThe issue really that was raised in the motion to stay \nand that I addressed in our response to the motion to stay is \nthat Mr. Epstein's -- \nMr. Epstein wants to stay the litigation \nin \norder to leave, in order to sort of attack the cases of the \nvictims whether they are fully within \nthe non-prosecution or \nnot, non-prosecution agreement or not, and leave the \nGovernment \nwithout a remedy if he does, in fact, breach those terms. And \nthat is why we \nopposed the stay. \nTHE COURT: \nI'm not sure what you mean by that last \nstatement. \nMS. \n: \nWell, because this issue related to \nthe motion to dismiss on Mr. Josefsberg's client came up after \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014224\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 34 of 51 34 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwe had filed that response. \nAnd what we said in the response \nto the motion to stay is that the reason why he wants to stay \nthe \nlitigation is so that the non-prosecution agreement \nterminates based on a period of time, as he puts it. And then \nafterwards he would be able to come in here and make all of \nthese arguments that \nclearly violate the non-prosecution \nagreement but we would be without remedy. \nTHE \nCOURT: But you're not taking the position that \nother than \npossibly doing something in litigation which is a \nviolation of an \nexpress provision of the non-prosecution \nagreement, any other discovery, motion practice, investigations \nthat someone would ordinarily do in the course of defending a \ncivil case would constitute a violation of the agreement? \nMS. \n:  No, Your Honor. I mean, civil \nlitigation is civil \nlitigation, and being able to take \ndiscovery is \npart of what civil litigation is about. And while \nthere may be, for \nexample, if someone were to try to subpoena \nthe \nGovernment, we would obviously resist under statutory \nreasons, all that sort of stuff. But, no, \nMr. Epstein is \nentitled to take the deposition of a plaintiff and to subpoena \nrecords, etc. \nTHE COURT: And even if \nhe seeks discovery from a \nGovernment agency, you have the right to resist it under the \nrules of procedure but that would not constitute a violation, \nagain unless there's a provision in the prosecution agreement \nTOTAL \nACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014225\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06)24:2009 Page 35 of 51 35 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthat says I can't do this? \nMS. : \nCorrect. \nTHE COURT: \nThat's your position? \nMS. : \nYes. \nTHE COURT: \nThank you. \nMS. :  Thank you, Your \nHonor. \nTHE COURT: \nMr. Critton, did you want to add anything? \nMR. CRITTON: Yes, sir. \nJust a few responses to some \nof the issues that have been raised. \nThe most \nglaring, at least from our perspective, is \nboth \nMr. Josefsberg's comments that he believes that \nthere's -t \nviolation of the NPA \nas well as Ms. \nwith \nregard to \nJane \nDoe 101. \nMr. Josefsberg, while he was \nthe attorney rep who was \nselected by Judge Davis to represent a number \nof individuals, \nalleged victims that may have been on the list, he represents \nmany of them. And the type of \nresponse that was filed in 101 \nwould probably be \nvery similar to what we will file if he \nfiles -- and he filed 102 as well. But if he files 103, 104 \nand 105, or whatever number he \nfiles, we may well take that \nsame legal position in our motions and in our response or in \nreply. \nAnd \nwhat we've been, in essence, told today is we \nconsider that to be a violation of the NPA under \nthe \ncircumstances. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME \nTRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014226\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 36 of 51 36 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n102 is a \nperfect example that he filed is, we have \ne-mails \ngoing back and forth between the Government and my \nclients' attorneys at the time that suggested that 102 probably \ndoesn't even fit within the statute of limitations. \nSo under Mr. Josefsberg's argument \nis as well, we've \nonly brought a 2255 claim. We \ndon't care whether she's within \nor is outside the statute of limitations. Because she was on \nthe list and under the circumstances, he has to admit \nliability, which \nwe contest is under that set of circumstances \nyou're stuck with it. You can fight damages if you can, but \nshe's a real person and you can't raise statute of limitations. \nThe other \npoint that kind of strikes out is there's \nprobably a difference. And I'm happy to provide a copy of the \nNPA or a redacted portion of \nthe NPA which deals with the civil \nissues, which are paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and \n10, and the entire \naddenda in camera for the Court \nto look at, if plaintiff's \ncounsel and the Government, I guess, really, because they're \nnot a party, is if they have no objection because they all have \naccess based on a prior court order to the non-prosecution \nagreement. \nSo I'm happy to provide that to the Court today and \nshow it to counsel so that the Court can review that. \nBut our position with regard to the 2255 claims is \nthat -- there were two types of claims that could be filed, one \nwas consensual litigation, the second was contested litigation. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014227\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 37 of 51 37 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nAnd under the \nconsensual, in essence, which Mr. Epstein did, is \nhe's offered $50,000 of the statutory minimum for \nthat time \nperiod to all of those individuals. \nTHE COURT: \nCan I interrupt you a second? \nMR. CRITTON: Yes, \nsir. \nTHE COURT: I'm not here, and I don't believe it's my \nrole to decide whether or not there is or is not a breach of \nthe \nagreement. I'm just trying to understand what the \nGovernment's \nposition is regarding your defending these cases. \nNow, I'm just saying \nthis as an example. If, for \nexample, in the non\n-prosecution agreement there was a provision \nthat said explicitly: \nJeffrey Epstein shall not move to \ndismiss any claim \nbrought under 2255 by any victim no matter \nhow long ago the allegations or the acts took place, period. \nIf that was in the agreement and you filed a motion to \ndismiss by someone who \nbrought a claim, it might sound like it \nmight be a \nviolation. \nMR. CRITTON: \nI agree. \nTHE COURT: So \nyou would know that when you filed your \nmotion because it was right there for you to read. \nAnd so to stay the case because I want to do something \nthat the contract expressly prohibits me from doing, so stay \nthe case until the agreement expires so then I can do something \nthat the agreement said I couldn't do so you won't be in fear \nof prosecuting, I'm not sure that that is what I'm concerned \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014228\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06 24 2009 Page 38 of 51 38 \n1 \nabout. \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nI'm concerned about discovery, investigation, motion \npractice, that's not prohibited by a provision of \nthe \nagreement. If \nthere's something that's prohibited by the \nagreement that you, \nknowing what \nthe agreement says, \ngo \nahead \nand do, anyway, I guess that's a risk you're \ngoing to have to \ntake. If there's a legitimate dispute about it, I guess some \narbiter is going to decide whether it's a breach or not. \nBut, again, that's something \nyou and Mr. Burman, \nMr. Goldberger, and you are all very good lawyers, and he's got \na whole list of lawyers \nrepresenting him, and you've got the \nagreement and you're going to make legal decisions on how to \nproceed, and you're going to have to go and make your own \ndecisions. \nI'm concerned about things that aren't in the \nagreement, that aren't covered, that you're going to be accused \nof violating because, again, you take depositions, you send out \nsubpoenas, you file motions that are not prohibited by the \nagreement. \nAnd that's what I'm concerned about. \nMR. CRITTON: And I \nunderstand that, Your Honor. \nBut at the same time, it's \nas if the lawyers and the \nclients, based upon our \ninterpretation of the agreement, and, \nbelieve me, we would not \nhave filed 101, the motion to dismiss, \nbut for \nbelieving that there was a good faith basis to do that \nunder the circumstances. \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME \nTRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014229\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 39 of 51 39 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nAnd now, in essence, \nwe're being accused not only by \n-- not accused, but it's been suggested that there's a breach \nof the NPA, not only by Mr. \nJosefsberg on behalf of 101, but as \nwell \nMs. \non \nbehalf of the United States. \nThat's the perfect example. They're basically saying \nwe think \nyou violated. We may send you notice under the \ncircumstances. So does that mean that on 101 we have to back \noff of it because we think in good faith that it's a motion and \nis that something that this Court \nultimately will rule? \nTHE \nCOURT: I don't know that I'm the one who is going \nto make that decision. Again, \nthat's not the kind of thing \nthat I was concerned about. I was more concerned about the \nnormal, ordinary course of conducting and defending a case that \nwould not otherwise expressly be covered under the agreement, \nthat you're going to then have someone say, ah, he's sent a \nnotice of deposition, he's \nharassing the plaintiffs. I don't \nknow if there's a no contact provision in the agreement or no \nharassment type of provision in the \nagreement. Ah, this is a \nbreach because you sent discovery, or he's issuing subpoenas to \nthird parties \ntrying to find out about these victims' \nbackgrounds, he's breaching the agreement. \nThose are the kind of things that I was worried about. \nMR. CRITTON: The concern \nthat we have is as part of \ndoing this general civil \nlitigation, it's not just the \ndiscovery process. And I understand the issues that the Court \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014230\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06;24:2009 Page 40 of 51 40 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nhas raised. \nBut part of it is that often cases are disposed of \neither \non a summary basis or certainly legal issues that come \nbefore the Court during the course of the case, just like in a \ncriminal case. That's clearly part of the, I'd say the defense \nof the case under the circumstances; and if, in fact, an \nindividual \ncan't legally bring a cause of action for certain \nreasons, such as has been suggested in 101, and may be \nsuggested in 102 when that \npleading is filed, that certainly is \na position that puts my \nclient at risk. \nAs another example that I use with C.M.A., that they \nfiled this 30-count complaint. Now, they have the state court \nclaims as \nwell. But they, in essence, have said they filed \nanother pleading with the Court that says depending on what the \nCourt rules, in essence, on \nwhether we can file multiple claims \nor \none cause of action with multiple \nviolations, we may dump \nthe state court claims and, therefore, we'll just ride \nalong on \nthat. \nThat's a very different --\nMr. Epstein would never have \nentered into, nor would \nhis \nattorneys have allowed him to enter into that agreement \nunder those circumstances where he had this unlimited \nliability. That clearly was \nnever envisioned by any of the \ndefendants -- by the defendant or any of his lawyers under the \ncircumstances. \nAnd if that's claimed to be a violation, either by the \nTOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION \nEFTA00014231\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM \nDocument 180 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 Page 41 of 51 4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nattorneys; i.e., he's not \nrecapitulating on liability under the \n2255, and that's all we have now.

It again chills us from moving forward, \nfiling the \nnecessary motion papers and taking legal positions \nthat may put my \nclient at risk for violating the NPA and then \ncreating the irreparable harm of, after having been in jail, \nafter \nhaving pled guilty to the state court counts, after \nregistering on release as a sex offender, he's complied and \ndone everything, \ntaken extraordinary efforts to comply with the \nNPA, puts him at substantial risk.
