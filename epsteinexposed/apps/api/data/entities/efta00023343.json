And hope you and yours are staying healthy in these unusual times. \nbest, \nFrom: Sigrid McCawley \nSent: Wednesday, March 18, 2020 11:32 \nTo: \nSubject: FW: GM vs. Estate \nHello MI - I just received this from a reporter. It is an indemnification action filed in USVI by Maxwell. It contains \nstatements that are directly contradictory to Maxwell's previous sworn depositions including that Epstein was not \nassisting in any of her legal bills and she didn't receive anything of value from him etc. and it also references \ncorrespondence that she never produced in that case and lists companies that she was apparently employed by. \nI am still reviewing but I wanted to get it to you quickly. Looks like ABC is doing a story on it. \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES \nSCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nFort Lauderdale.
