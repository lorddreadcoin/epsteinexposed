The folder/its contents may be small \nenough that the FBI could send it via USAfx rather than having to burn a new disc, but we'll need a replacement of this \nfolder either way. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 5, 20214:27 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSubject: RE: CD with Maxwell files \nGreat, thank you! \n> \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Monday, April 5, 20214:20 PM \nTo: \n) \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSubject: RE: CD with Maxwell files \n>; \n>; \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nHi \nEFTA00029232\n\nFour of the five folders from the disc have successfully uploaded to the folder path linked below, but the fifth folder (18 1-\n14) contains at least one file that will not copy off of the disc (not sure if the file is corrupted or what the issue is exactly). \nI'll check with the IT folks and to see if they're able to copy the remaining folder off the disc or if we'll need the FBI \nto recopy and resend it.

It should be sitting in my \noffice on the 4th floor on my keyboard at my desk. Would one of you (or another paralegal who is in the office) be able to \nplease grab the CD and load its contents onto the Epstein share? You can save everything from the CD here: \nThanks so much, \nEFTA00029233",
