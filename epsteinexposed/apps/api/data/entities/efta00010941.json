Beyond the live \nfeeds within the courthouse, the trial will not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic dial-in to the \nroceedings. Victim access will be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office Victim-Witness Coordinator, \nand Mr. Joseph Pecorino of the Court's District Executive Office \n.
