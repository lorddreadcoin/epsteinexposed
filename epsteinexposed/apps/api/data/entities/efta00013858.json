PHILLIPS \nAARON \nAtrmoN \nMARCOS BSATON, JR. \nIllArnim P. \nO'BRIEN \nJoannJ. SOUIIIGAS \nNOAH Fox \nE-Mail: \nOnce again I need to send you a note about Jeffrey Epstein, mainly to keep \nyou in the loop so we don't inadvertently violate any provision of his agreement \nwith your office. As I  am sure you are aware, Mr. Epstein has finished the \nincarceration portion of his sentence and is now serving the one year of \ncommunity control as mandated by both his state plea and the terms of the non-\nprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida. \nMr. Epstein is in compliance with all terms of his community control and \nis applying for transfer of his supervision from the State of Florida \nto his primary \nresidence, the Virgin Islands. This transfer is being requested through the \nIntrastate Compact for Transfer of Adult Supervision \n(ICAOS). The ICAOS is the \nmechanism for which transfers of \nprobation and community control are \neffectuated. The process requires the offender to seek the approval of the sending \nstate (in this case Florida) and, if they agree, the receiving state (in this case the \nUnited States Virgin Islands) and the United States Virgin Islands after \ninvestigation has pre-approved the transfer under the same exact conditions of \nsupervision as imposed in Mr. Epstein's community control sentence in the State \nof Florida. \nEven though Mr. Epstein is requesting \nthe transfer he is still at the home \n2015. Biscayne Boulevard. Suite 1300 • Miami. Florida 33131. \nPhone \n• \nFax: -• \nwww.RcyBlack.com \nEFTA00013858\n\nJeffrey Sloman, Esq. \nSeptember 1, 2009 \nPage 2 \nin Palm Beach following the rules of \nstate community control. As Mr. Epstein's \nlawyers, we believe that his request to administratively \ntransfer his community \ncontrol is in full compliance with both his \nstate plea agreement and the non-\nprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office. Nonetheless we \nhave taken to heart your \nprevious suggestion of erring on the side of caution and \nthus we are advising you \nof this request. \nI  am happy to discuss this with you at any time. I  did not want to set an \nappointment to see you on this issue since I  imagine you have more pressing \nmatters to deal with than a transfer of a state community control matter. \nRB/wg \nVery \n1 \nRoy Black \nBlack.
