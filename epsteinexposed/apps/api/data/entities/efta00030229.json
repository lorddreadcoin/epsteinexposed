As I mentioned Mr. \nEpstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish \nresidence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a \nnew photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at \nmy office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or \nconcerns in this matter. \nNew York City Police Department \nSpecial Victims Division \nCommanding Officer \nSex Offender Monitoring Unit \n, N.Y, N.Y. \nEFTA00030229",
