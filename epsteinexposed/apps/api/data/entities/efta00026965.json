Here is a bit of an explanation and I also asked her to \ntake a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need \nanything else: \n\"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored \npencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I  talk about the highlights of my NY trip \nand going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I  talk about going to the movies \nwith him.\" \nBest, \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES \nSCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nwww.bstilp.com \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, January 10, 2020 4:01 PM \nTo: \nCc\nSubject: RE: follow-up request \n0\nThanks very much, Sigrid.

I know she shared some pictures with you from around the time period \nwhen she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to you and will check with her \nto see if she has anything else that might be helpful to the investigation. \nAll my best, \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nwww.bsfilp.com \nFrom: \n[mailto\nSent: Friday, January 10, 2020 3:30 PM \nTo: \nCc \nSubject: follow-up request \nHi Sigrid, \n>;I \nC > \nHope you had a wonderful holiday season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we made after \ninterviewing a few months ago. During her interview, referred to several entries in her journal that \nhad helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As we mentioned at the end of the \ninterview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review those journal entries, as well as any other \nrecords or documents may have that relate to her experiences with Epstein and Maxwell. \nWould be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may have) to \nassist in our investigation? \nHappy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. \nEFTA00026966\n\nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nThe information contained in this electronic message is confidential information intended only for the use of the named recipientts) and may contain information that. \namong other protections, is the subject of attorney-client privilege. attorney work product or \nexempt from disclosure under applicable law.
