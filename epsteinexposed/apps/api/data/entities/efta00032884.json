In the event of such termination, the \nContractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and \nshall \nimmediately cause any and all of its suppliers and \nsubcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor \nshall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the \npercentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, \nplus \nreasonable charges that the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the \nGovernment, using its standard record keeping \nsystem, have resulted from the termination.

This paragraph does not give the Government \nany right to audit the Contractor's records. The \nContractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs \nincurred that reasonably could have been avoided. \n(g) \nTermination for cause. The Government may terminate this \ncontract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of \nany default by \nthe \nContractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and \nconditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon \nrequest, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event \nof termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to \nthe \nContractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and \nall rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the \nGovernment improperly terminated this contract for default, such \ntermination shall be deemed a \ntermination for convenience. \n(h) Warranty. \nThe Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered \nhereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the \nparticular purpose described \nin this contract. \n52.213-2 Invoices (Apr \n1984) \nThe Contractor's \ninvoices must be submitted before payment can \nbe \nmade. \nThe \nContractor will \nbe \npaid \non the basis of the invoice, \nwhich must state-\n(a) The starting and ending dates of the \nsubscription delivery; and \n(b) Either that orders have been placed in effect for the \naddressees required, or that the orders will be placed in effect upon receipt of \npayment. \n(End of \nclause) \n52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management (Oct 2018) \n(a) Method of payment. \n( 1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in \nparagraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term \"EFT\" \nrefers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment \ninformation transfer. \n(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by \nEFT, the Contractor agrees to either—\n(i) \npayment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or \n(ii) Request the Government to \nextend the payment due date until such time as the Government \ncan make payment by EFT (but see \nparagraph (d) of this clause). \n(b) \nContractor's EFT information. The Government \nshall make payment to the Contractor using the \nEFT information contained in \nthe System for \nAward Management (SAM). In the event that the \nEFT information changes, the Contractor \nshall be responsible for \nproviding the updated information to the SAM. \n(c) \nMechanisms for EFT payment. The \nGovernment may make payment by EFT \nthrough either the Automated Clearing House \n(AC!!) \nnetwork, subject to \nthe rules of the National \nAutomated Clearing House \nAssociation, or the Fedwire Transfer \nSystem. The rules \ngoverning Federal payments \nthrough the ACII are contained in 31 CFR Part \n210. \n(d) Suspension of payment. If \nthe Contractor's EFT \ninformation in the SAM is incorrect, \nthen the Government need not \nmake payment \nto the Contractor \nunder this contract until \ncorrect EFT information is entered \ninto the SAM; and any \ninvoice or contract financing \nEFTA00032889\n\n15JA5419P000003T/ Page 7 of 8 \nrequest shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice \nfor the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The \nprompt payment terms \nof the contract regarding notice of an improper \ninvoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. \n(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. \n(I) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information \nincorrectly, the \nGovernment remains responsible for—. \n(i) Making a correct \npayment; \n(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and \n(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. \n(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 \ndays of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to \nthe Federal Reserve System, and--\n(i) If the funds are no longer under \nthe control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the \nContractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or \n(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the \nGovernment shall not make payment, and the provisions of \nparagraph (d) of this clause shall apply. \n(0 EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt \npayment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date \nspecified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid \ndate under the rules of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. \n(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims \nterms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in \nthe SAM and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, \npayment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims \npursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the \nContractor. EFT \ninformation that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper \nassignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the \nmeaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. \n(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from \nchanges to EFT \ninformation made by the \nContractor's financial agent. \n(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office \nshall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is \nsuitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal \nReserve System. The Government may request \nthe Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of \nformats and methods the \npayment office is capable of \nexecuting. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery \nis available at any particular \npayment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most \nconvenient to the \nGovernment. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with \nparagraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail \nthe payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM. \n(End of clause) \nEFTA00032890\n\n15JA5419P00000377 Page 8 of 8 \nSection 4 \n- List of \nAttachments \nThis Section Is \nIntentionally Left Blank \nEFTA00032891",
