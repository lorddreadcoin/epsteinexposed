I \nam told that moisture in her cell has degraded envelopes and paperwork and the temperature check was \nconducted outside her cell. \nI request that Ms. Maxwell be moved to an interior cell. This relocation would eliminate exposure to moisture \nand cold air seeping through exterior concrete walls. Further, it would assist in safeguarding Ms. Maxwell from \nimpending cold temperatures and the detrimental effect of wind, rain and snow. \nYour continued assistance is needed and greatly appreciated. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
