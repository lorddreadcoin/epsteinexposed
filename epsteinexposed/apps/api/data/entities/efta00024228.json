Both were then \ndelivered to Ms. Maxwell on those days. \n>>>  BOBBI C STERNHEIM < >  10/26/2021 9:14 PM >>> \nGood evening-\nI am still awaiting a reply to yesterday's email regarding Ms. Maxwell's legal mail. \nThere are items that need to be picked up by the MDC. \nI have provided the tracking information. \nPlease provide a response by 10:00 am tomorrow Wednesday. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nPlease note my new office address and preferred email address: \nBOBBI C.

The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. \nPrevious requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim \nthe camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner \nroom. \nI am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. \nThe previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. \nAlso, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below. \nPlease promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries. \nThank you-\nBobbi \n<Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 7.10.13 PM.png> \n<Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 7.07.56 PM.png> \nPlease note my new office address and preferred email address: \nBOBBI C.
