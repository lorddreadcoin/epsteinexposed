JOSEFSBERG\" \nTo: \nCc: \nScarola Jack <MI=I\n> \nSubject: Epstein \nDate: Tue, 06 Aug 2019 22:01:07 +0000 \nAs we know, Epstein's Lawyers are going to claim that the NPR agreement prohibits your prosecution. I want to \nshare some information with you regarding that issue. You are probably already aware of this, but I'd prefer that \nyou learn about it twice instead of never being aware of this proof. At the state court plea hearing, Epstein's \ncounsel told the court that the NPR covered only the So Dist Of Fla. On the next page of the transcript the Judge \nmesses it up a bit, but we know that when she said \"they\", she meant the \nUSAO \nof the So Dist of Fla, NOT the \nDOJ. I am forwarding to you the cover sheet and two relevant pages of the transcript. along with info re when \nand where his occurEd. If you have any questions about this, or any other way I can assist, \nyou please call me PS - two of my clients have advised me that they have contacted the FBI. \nRobert \nC. Josefsberg, Esq. \nSent from my iPhone \nEFTA00028077",
