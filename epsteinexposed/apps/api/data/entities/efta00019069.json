We would \nask you to confirm the request sent to you yesterday has been forwarded. We also request that DNA be lifted from the \nligatures and/or bed stripping found in Mr Epstein's MCC cell on August 10, 2019. \nSeparately, since the attorney client privilege survives death, we are still requesting a taint review in the event any review \nat all of his emails from the seizures at Teterboro on Aug 6 or from his NYC residence are to be undertaken. If you provide \nme with the name of the taint attorney when selected, I will provide a list of attorneys. \nLastly, is it the Government's intention to move to dismiss the Indictment against Mr. Epstein and if so will that occur \ntoday? \nThanks, Marty \nMartin G.
