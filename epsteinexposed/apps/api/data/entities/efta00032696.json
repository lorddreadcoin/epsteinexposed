Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court \nhas not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green \nmarking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the docs, but it looks like not all. Do you have a \ncomprehensive set somewhere? \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nTelephone: \nEFTA00032696",
