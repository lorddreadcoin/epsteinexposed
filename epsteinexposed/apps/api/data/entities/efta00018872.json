A few things that will probably be helpful to know: \n1. There were some commissary receipts/finance documents pertaining to Epstein's activity inside of prison. I didn't \nknow where to put this so I left it outside of the folders but still inside MCC Recs \n2. In the MCC Regs folder, I put a few things: \na. One file had inventory and then at the end some documents pertaining to daily key counts. I wasn't sure \nif these were different so I created a separate file for the key counts just in case (while also keeping them \nin the inventory file) \nb. The MCC training 06-06-19 & information file was confusing to me. It was massive and I couldn't tell \nwhether or not I needed to separate anything out. \nEFTA00018872\n\nEverything else should be pretty straightforward as to where it is located. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything \nor help any further. \n= \nEFTA00018873",
