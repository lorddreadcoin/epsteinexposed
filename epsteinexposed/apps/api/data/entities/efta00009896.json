NATHAN, District Judge: \nThe Defense has moved for an order \"prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel \nfor witnesses from making extrajudicial statements concerning this case.\" Dkt. No. 27 at 1. \nThe Court firmly expects that counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to \nensure compliance with this Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the \nrules of professional responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe \nthat further action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an \nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But the Court \nwarns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it \nwill not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The \nCourt will ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to \na fair trial will be safeguarded. \nSO \nORDERED. \nDated: July 23, 2020 \nNew York, New York \nALISON J. NATHAN \nUnited States District Judge \nEFTA00009896",
