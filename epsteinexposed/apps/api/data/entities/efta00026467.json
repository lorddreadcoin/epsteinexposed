View in web browser \nThe Wall Street Journal. \nEFTA00026467\n\nG\nood morning \nand welcome to Notes on the News. \nIt's Tuesday, Jan. 26. Here's what you should \nknow today: Leon Black is \nstepping down, Moderna is \ntesting a vaccine booster shot as new virus strains \nspread and Dominion Voting is suing Rudy Giuliani \nfor $1.3 billion. \nLet \nus know what you think by replying to this email. \nWhat's News \nEFTA00026468\n\nPHOTO: LUCY NICHOLSON/REUTERS \n1. Apollo's Leon Black will exit following probe. The fund's chief executive \nwill cede his role by July 31 after an independent report found he had made a larger-\nthan-expected $148 million payment to Jeffrey Epstein for legitimate advice. Black \nwasn't involved in the disgraced financier's criminal activities, the report said. \n2. Senate confirms Janet Yellen as \ntreasury secretary. The former Fed \nchairwoman will spearhead President Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion economic relief \npackage, which provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended \nand enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the \ncreation of a nationwide vaccination program. \n3. Article of \nimpeachment sent to the Senate for second Trump trial. The \ncase is expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over former President Donald \nEFTA00026469\n\nTrump's legacy and his future influence over the party. However, many aides were \nskeptical that 17 Republican senators would join all Democrats and vote to convict \nhim. \n4. Amazon \ncontinues its U.S. expansion. The tech giant is planning to add \n3,000 employees in the Boston area, one of a number of expansions of technology \njobs in major American cities. The jobs will include roles in technology and software \ndevelopment. \n5. Saved stimulus checks are expected to help spur an economic \nrecovery. Many households have boosted their savings during the pandemic, and \nthe pent-up demand for services like travel and dining is expected to propel \neconomic growth once vaccines become widespread. \nE WSJ NEWS EXCLUSIVE \n6. Business Insider's \npandemic strategy paid off. Many business leaders \nresponded to the Covid-19 crisis with a flurry of activity and strategy shifts, but the \nbusiness-news site chose to do nothing  and let the storm  pass. It generated 3096 \nrevenue growth in 2020, benefiting from a burgeoning subscription business and a \nform of automated advertising. \n7. Judge approves $17 million fund for \nHarvey Weinstein victims. Women \nwho have accused the former Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct are expected \non average to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars under the deal. \nCompiled by B►yony Watson in London. \nLatest on the Coronavirus Pandemic \n• Latest: New U.S. cases stay below 200,000 for ninth day in a row. \n• Delays in vaccine deliveries damp the prospect of a normal summer in Europe. \n• Biden says the U.S. could be heading  toward herd immunity by summer. \n• Oxygen shortages are contributing  to Cavid-is deaths. \nBy the Numbers \nEFTA00026470\n\nILLUSTRATION: TAMMY LIAN \n13% The approximate share of the U.K.'s  gross domestic  product that comes \nfrom recreation, culture and hospitality spending—a higher amount than any other \nCT-7 economy. As the pandemic hammered in-person businesses last year, the U.IC's \neconomy shrank more than all other CT-7 nations—the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, \nCanada and Japan. \n19.2% — The rate at which National Football League teams have attempted a \nfourth-down conversion this season, the highest frequency since at least 1991. In the \nNFL, such conversion attempts used to be rare, but the increased use of data \nanalytics in the league has seen teams increasingly realize that it can sometimes be a \nsavvy move. The Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots both recently \nadvanced to the Super Bowl by using that tactic. \nEFTA00026471\n\n$20 - The value of the bill that could soon bear the face of abolitionist Harriet \nTubman. The White House said it would restart efforts to put her face on the \ncurrency after the Trump administration postponed those plans. \nAdvertisement \nThe Data Point \nEFTA00026472\n\nGameStop's stock is reaching \nnew heights. Prompted in part by a popular \nReddit forum, individual investors are buying up the videogame retailer's stock, \nfacing  off with those on Wall Street who were holding short positions. The rally \nresulted in a short squeeze, which is when rising prices prompt investors to buy back \nshares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still. At its \npeak on Monday, GameStop's share price surged as much as 145% to hit $159.18. \nWhat Everyone Wants to Know \nA \nPHOTO: JEFF KOWALSKY/AGENCE FRANCE•PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES \nDominion Voting Systems is suing Rudy Giuliani for $1.3 billion. \nEFTA00026473\n\nThe election-equipment maker claims in a defamation lawsuit that former President \nTrump's personal lawyer and his allies spread false allegations against the company \nthat \"foreseeably went viral and deceived millions of people into believing that \nDominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election.\" Dominion's voting machines \nare used by more than 40% of U.S. voters. Since November, Trump allies, right-wing \nmedia personalities and others have targeted the company with unsubstantiated \nallegations that it rigged the vote, and the company says its employees have received \ndeath threats. Giuliani, who led Trump's legal team during his string of failed court \nchallenges to states' vote counts, was among the highest-profile promoters of \nallegations against Dominion. He said the lawsuit was \"another act of intimidation \nby the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech.\" \nThe pandemic has prevented many refugees from \nresettling. \nNearly 1.5 million refugees were in urgent need of resettlement through the United \nNations last year, but just 22,70 people had the chance, according to the U.N. \nRestrictions on international travel meant that refugees who had already waited \nyears for asylum requests to be granted were forced to wait months for national \nborders to reopen to them. Last year saw the lowest number of refugees resettled \nsince at least 2003, and those entering the U.S. fell to the lowest level in the 40-year \nhistory of its refugee program after the Trump administration capped admittances. \nModerna is developing a vaccine booster shot for the South African \ncoronavirus strain. \nThe drugmaker said its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to protect against emerging \nvariants of the coronavirus in lab tests. As a precaution, however, it is working to see \nwhether a booster shot improves immune responses and the company said it could \ndevelop a new vaccine targeting the strain first identified in South Africa. A variant \nthat also appears to be more deadly has been identified in the U.K. and the U.S. The \nnew strains appear to spread more easily, and if existing vaccines do produce a \nweaker immune response, the virus could continue to mutate significantly as \ncountries inoculate more of their populations. The South African variant hasn't been \nidentified in the U.S., and to curb the spread of new strains, Biden restricted travel \nfrom South Africa and re-established a ban on most travel into the U.S. from Europe, \nthe U.K. and Brazil. \nIn Case You Missed It \nEFTA00026474\n\n• Italaprime minister is set to resign as the country battles Covid-19 and a \nrecession. \n• AMC has secured $9v million in new financing to help it avoid bankruptcy.\n• The pandemic might reshape men's fashion. \n• Budweiser isn't running a Super Bowl ad this  year. \nTake a Break \nPHOTO: BRANTLEY GUTIERREZ \n• Go listen to: \"Medicine at Midnight,\" the Foo Fighters' newest album, out on \nFeb. 5. \nEFTA00026475\n\nToday's newsletter was curated by Tyler BUnt-Welsh in New York, in collaboration \nwith colleagues in New York and London. \nWe hope you're enjoying the daily Notes on the News.
