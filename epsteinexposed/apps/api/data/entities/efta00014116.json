They are willing to agree that there are no charges against Epstein in federal court, and he \nentered pleas of guilty in state court and is incarcerated in Palm Beach County. However, they ask us to also agree to two facts regarding \nthe deferral of prosecution agreement and the reason why the victims were not consulted. \nAs to the reasons why the victims were not consulted, the confidentiality provision would not seem to be the reason for not consulting, \nsince there was no \"agreement\" until Epstein and our office reached agreement in September 2007. The confidentiality provision was \nnot binding until there was an actual agreement. My understanding is that the victims were not consulted (with the exception of the FBI \nagents meeting with M. in September 2007), because we did not believe the Crime Victims Rights Act applied. \nThey also still want a free transcript and any FBI 302's prepared for the meeting with \nI intend to call Edwards on Monday and tell him we cannot produce the agreement due to the confidentiality provision (and not due to a \nlack of courtesy on our part). I  will then ask if he still wants to meet. I  will be back from Columbia on Thursday, so I  can meet with \nthem on Thursday or Friday. Are you available on those dates 1='? Thanks. \n«edwards-ltr2.pdf» \nEFTA00014116",
