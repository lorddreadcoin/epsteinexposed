NATHAN, District Judge: \nIn its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 \nsuperseding indictment in whole or in part and granted the Defendant's motion to sever the \nperjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt. No. 207. The Court will try the non\n-perjury \ncounts first. \nAs the Court noted in its Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to \nsuppress evidence. See Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the \nGovernment obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her \nrights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self-incrimination, and to due process \nof law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the \nGovernment knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an order modifying the protective order. \nThe Court requires information from the Government for scheduling purposes. \nThe Government is ORDERED to inform the Court by letter docketed on ECF no later \nthan April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use any of the documents subject to the pending \nmotions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case. \nEFTA00027089\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 216 Filed 04/19/21 Page 2 of 2 \nIf the Government does not intend to use any of the documents subject to the pending \nmotions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts, the Court will defer consideration of \nthose motions until it has scheduled the trial of the perjury counts. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: April 19, 2021 \nNew York, New York \n2 \nALISON J.
