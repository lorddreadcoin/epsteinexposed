The folder/its contents may be small \nenough that the FBI could send it via USAfx rather than having to burn a new disc, but we'll need a replacement of this \nfolder either way. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 5, 20214:27 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSubject: RE: CD with Maxwell files \nGreat, thank you! \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Monday, April 5, 2021 4:20 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSubject: RE: CD with Maxwell files \nHi \n>; \n>; \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nFour of the five folders from the disc have successfully uploaded to the folder path linked below, but the fifth folder (18 1-\n14) contains at least one file that will not copy off of the disc (not sure if the file is corrupted or what the issue is exactly). \nI'll check with the IT folks and to see if they're able to copy the remaining folder off the disc or if we'll need the FBI \nto recopy and resend it. I will keep you posted on the status of this last folder. \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Monday, April 5, 20212:04 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: FW: CD with Maxwell files \nThank you so much! \nEFTA00032648\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 5, 2021 1:55 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n< \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: CD with Maxwell files \nH= and M, \nOn Friday, the FBI brought me a CD containing additional files that I need to review for Maxwell.
