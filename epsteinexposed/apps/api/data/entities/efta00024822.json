Would it be possible to let the CSOs to know that they should transfer any \nincoming calls to the following extension, where they can leave a message? It's been set up so that those messages will \nauto-forward to our whole team. The number is 212-637-1030. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00024822",
