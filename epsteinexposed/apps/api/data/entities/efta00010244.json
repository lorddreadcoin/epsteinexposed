The new \nones start at row 71 (juror 199), with the one exception that I also reassigned rows 39 and 40 (the last two from \nla\nfirst batch we didn't get to today). \nII print yours out so we have the same hard copy notes method.Msince I didn't get this \ndone before you headed out, if you want to take notes in the spreadsheet attached and send to me by 7:45am tomorrow, \nI can print it out in the morning (but obviously do what's best for you note taking wise, I'm happy to accommodate \nhowever I can). \nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office SDNY \n1 Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York.
