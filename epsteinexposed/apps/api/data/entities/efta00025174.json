Maxwell - [Request for 120 or 180-day Adjournment of Trial] \nJudge Nathan - \nPursuant to this Court's Order of April 20, 2021 (Dkt. 221), attached please find counsel's Letter Motion for an \nAdjournment of the trial. \nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell request redaction of their other clients' names and case numbers from this Letter Motion \npursuant to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 which prohibits lawyers from revealing confidential information related to a \nclient even where that information is publicly available. See In Re. Anonymous, 654 N.E. 2.d. 1128 (Ind. 1995) (lawyer \nviolated Rule 1.6 by disclosing information relating to representation of client, even though information \"was readily \navailable from public sources and not confidential in nature\"); In re Bryan, 61 P.3d 641 (Kan. 2003) (lawyer violated Rule \n1.6 by disclosing, in court documents, existence of defamation suit against former client); State ex rel. Okla. Bor Ass'n v. \nMcGee, 48 P.3d 787, 791 (Okla. 2002) (a lawyer's duty of confidentiality attaches \"to all information relating to the \nrepresentation, whatever its source\"). \nUpon direction of the Court, counsel will file either the redacted or unredacted version of this letter on the public docket. \nBest regards, \nLaura Menninger \nLaura A.
