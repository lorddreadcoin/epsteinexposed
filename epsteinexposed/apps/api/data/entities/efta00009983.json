Do \nwe think Judge Nathan would let us just file it under seal? If we do, we can docket the whole motion and just submit this \none exhibit under seal. \nFrom \nSent: Monda November 8, 2021 9:43 PM \nTo: \n) \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Daubert motion \nUSANYS) \nThanks very much, I've reviewed and have no substantive edits. There were a few typos, but I gather from the \nemail chain that multiple proofreads are ongoing, so don't want to clutter your inbox with track changes on those. Agree, \nthere is no need to redact this filing and agree with your proposed approach to the exhibits. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, November 8, 2021 7:02 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: FW: Daubert motion \nThis is the version ready for you, and specifically, Part I.C.4-6. \n(USANYS) \nAlso, team, I don't think we need to redact this filing, but we definitely want to redact the defense expert notice and the \nattached defense list of material, so I'm inclined to just file these temporarily under seal again. Let me know your \nthoughts, and I'll add our customary sealing footnote. \nFrom \nSent: Monday, November 8, 2021 6:57 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Daubert motion \nHe'\nPassing the pen back to you while I'm joining the Rocchio witness prep. \nEFTA00009983\n\nI've \ninputted the chiefs' \ncomments, Es comments, and the \ncitecheck from I'll \nbe done with the webex at 10 \nand \nwill \nfinalize the exhibit \nattachments then. So that leaves \ninputting the intern citecheck \nfrom which I've also \nattached, making sure those two \narticles don't contain any \nbombs before we file them, \nand anything else you have \nthe \ntime \nor inclination to do. \nThank \nyou again for all your \nhelp with this! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 Saint \nAndrews Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00009984",
