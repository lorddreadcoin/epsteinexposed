Or if he represents her in his \ncapacity as an attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just \nwant to confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to \npay for third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we \ncertainly could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it \neasier for the friend to be present?

There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything \nthat would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell \nEFTA00017775\n\nher, as we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is \nno problem at all. \nIn fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, \nexplained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being \ncomfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the \ntalking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for \nanything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are \nable to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in \napproaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client \nwere willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or \nvictimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about \ntopics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as \nalways we would be guided by her comfort level. \nIn terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and \nthat's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet \nthe people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a \ndiscussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment \nand are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in \nparticular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell \nyou in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could \nfacilitate that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure \nyou that every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive \nexperience more generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how \nwe have been able to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely \nwould take the same sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who \nhave spoken with us. \nAgain, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how \nour process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that \nwith no obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could \njust address the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue \nto appreciate your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. \nthank you very much, \nIM• \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Saturday, February 08, 2020 14:25 \nTo: Jill Greenfield \nCc: Kyle Phillips \n(USANYS) < \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \n>; \n; Louise Scott \n(USANYS) \n<I \nEFTA00017776\n\nThanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the \nmost likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The \nonly reason I saw \"most likely\" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign \ncountry, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't \nbelieve that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's \nuseful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just \nthe case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise \nwe're of course happy to travel to her.) \nRegarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team \nworking on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not \ngenerally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types \nup those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but \nI can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. \nWith respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our \ninvestigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other \nwitnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't \nchange even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have \nbeen connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of \ncourse happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any \nfollow-up via email. \nthanks, \nFrom: Jill \nGreenfield \nSent: Saturday, February 08, 2020 13:17 \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: Kyle Phillips \n(USANYS) \nSubject: Re: Epstein investigation \nHi \nThanks for this.

As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never \nspoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has \nbeen our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey \nEpstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble \nbelieving, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we \nhope to speak with her. \nSeparately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends \nnot just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss \nparticular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that \nwould be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. \nIn terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein \nand his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked \ndirectly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her \nemployment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences \nand observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general \nnature of the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the \nspecifics if she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first \nmeeting. \nPlease let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us \nwould be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFieldfisher, Riverbank House, 2 Swan Lane, London EC4R 3TT. \nwww.fieldfisher.com \nWe do not intend to change our bank details.
