The officers \ntold me to use the larger, corner room. \nPrevious requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied \nbecause the officers' claim \nthe camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and \neasily positioned the camera focused on the corner mom. \nI am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the \nEFTA00023482\n\nlarger corner \nroom. \nThe previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. \nAlso, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the \nfacility. See tracking information below. \nPlease promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell \nwill receive these \ndeliveries. \nThank you-\nBobbi \n<Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 7.10.13 PM.png> \n<Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 7.07.56 PM.png> \nPlease note my new office address and preferred email address: \nBOBBI C.
