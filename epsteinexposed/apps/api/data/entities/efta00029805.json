In the course of our ongoing review, we've located a chart which appears to identify Epstein's accounts at \nJ.P. Morgan prior to his transition to Deutsche Bank. The chart was attached to a September 12, 2013 email from Epstein's \naccountant, Harry Beller, to Paul Morris's assistant, Amanda Kirby. The subject line of the email reads: \"Let's discuss.\" \nThere is no text in the body of the email, but we know that Epstein was transferring assets from J.P. Morgan to Deutsche \nBank around this time. \nNotably, the chart identifies several accounts that were previously unknown to us, including a brokerage account \nbelonging to the Butterfly Trust. The chart also identifies the managers of Epstein's J.P. Morgan brokerage and asset \ntrading accounts. While we had previously flagged Epstein's relationship to Paul Barrett, we were previously unaware of \nEpstein's apparent relationship to Ted Serure or Laurie Cameron. As reflected in the chart, Ted Serure managed the \nButterfly Trust account, and, according to Barron's, he still works at J.P. Morgan Securities. \nThe referenced chart and email are attached. We will include a bates-stamped version of both documents in our next \nproduction, which we are in the process of finalizing. That production will also include a significant number of emails \nrelated to Darren Indyke's cash withdrawal activities. As always, we're happy to discuss if you have any questions or \nwould like us to follow up further. \nParvin \nParvin Daphne Moyne \nAKIN GUMP STRAUSS HAUER 8 FELD LLF. \nNew York, NY 10036-6745 j  USA I \nDirect: \nFax: j  akingump.com \nI \nBio \nI  Internal: \nEFTA00029805\n\nThe information contained in this e-mail message is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the \nrecipient(s) named above.
