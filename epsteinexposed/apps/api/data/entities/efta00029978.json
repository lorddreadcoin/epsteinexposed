Attached please find a copy of the cover memo. \nI also dropped off a hard drive and CD containing a new discovery production for Maxwell. Attached please find the two \ncover letters. \nLast week, we sent out via FedEx a hard drive containing a separate production, which included replacements of \nnumerous files that Maxwell has been unable to review from prior productions. The accompanying cover letters are \nattached. Would you please confirm that the drive has been provided to Maxwell? \nThanks very much, as always, for your help. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00029978",
