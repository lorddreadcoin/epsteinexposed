As a result, we need to request that you please \nprovide us with a drive (or drives if you would like multiple copies) on which to load the discovery for you. You can either \nbring the drive(s) to tomorrow's conference, or you can send them to our office at the below address to my attention. \nOnce we receive a drive (or drives) from you, we will get it loaded and sent back out to you as quickly as possible. \nAdditionally, if you would like Mr. Epstein to receive his own electronic copy of the discovery to review at the MCC, please \nprovide us with a hard drive (not a thumb drive—the MCC will only accept external hard drives) for us to load and send to \nthe MCC for his review. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00014534",
