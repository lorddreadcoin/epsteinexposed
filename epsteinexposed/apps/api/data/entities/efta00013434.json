Let me know if you're good with this, and I'll send a pdf to defense counsel. FYI I've changed \nthe cc line, since BSF is now in theory counsel of record in the case, and we're not sending this to them. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, April 29, 2021 2:45 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \nnice work on this, my edits are attached. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, April 29, 2021 11:01 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \n) < \n>; \n>; \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) < \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) \nIn case it's useful while we're troubleshooting this issue today, I'm attaching the working draft. We'll let you know if we \nfind additional authorities on this or obtain different guidance \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, April 29, 2021 10:32 AM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) \nCc: \nSubject: \n>; \n>; \n(USANYS) < \n>; \n(USANYS) \nS; \nWe're working on drafting a letter in response to the attached, and wanted to give you a heads up. We hope to have a \ndraft for you this afternoon, in the hopes of sending the draft to defense counsel tonight as part of the meet-and-confer \ndirected by Judge Nathan. I think that leaves sufficient time for filing tomorrow. \nAlthough we're mindful of third party privacy interests, for non-parties who are neither witnesses nor victims in the case, I \ndo have concerns about entertaining redaction/intervention requests, given the high volume of people who may ask to be \nheard or assert a right to review and redact documents if this were entertained. \nThanks, \nEFTA00013434\n\nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00013435",
