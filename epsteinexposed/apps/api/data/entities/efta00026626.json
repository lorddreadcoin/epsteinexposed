We were going to expand the FBI thank-you \nsentence to be the following: \nMr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the New York City Police Department and \nCustoms and Border Patrol for their assistance in the investigation. \nBut defer to you if you have a different preference, and let me know whether you want me to incorporate or if you guys \nhave the pen at this point. Thank you! \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, July 07, 2019 13:57 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: JE Release \n>*, \nNypd is a task force partner on the fbi crimes against children squad, so we have the release set up as a co-announce with \nthem, with a  slot for an quote, which we've asked for from dcpi.
