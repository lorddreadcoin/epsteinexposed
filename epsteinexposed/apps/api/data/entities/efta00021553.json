The new victims have \nsuffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime \nVictims' Rights Act (CVRA) as the \ncurrent victims. \nAccordingly, \nthey \ndesire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well. \nBecause the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current \nvictims \n(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), \nthe \nGovernment will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may \"at any time\" \nadd new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court \nshould grant the \nmotion.' \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n1 As minor victims of sexual offenses, \nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 desire to proceed by \nway of \npseudonym for the same reasons that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 proceeded \nin this \nfashion. Counsel \nfor the new victims have made their true identities known to the Government. \n1 \n004288 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021554\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD \nDocket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14 \nAs the Court is  aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action \nagainst the Government, alleging a  violation of her rights under the \nCVRA, 18 U.S.C. §  3771. \nDE I. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had \nentered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her \nrights. At \nthe first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the \naction. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to \nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to \nreasonable notice, and to be treated with \nfairness. In response, the \nGovernment argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1 \nand Jane Doe #2 because no \nfederal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein. \nThe Court has \nfirmly rejected the United States' position. \nIn a  detailed ruling, the Court \nconcluded that the CVRA \nextended rights to Jane Doc #1 and Jane Doc #2 even \nthough federal \ncharges \nwere never filed. DE 189. The \nCourt explained that because the \nNPA barred \nprosecution of crimes committed \nagainst them by Epstein, they had \n\"standing\" to assert \nviolations of the CVRA rights. Id. \nThe Court deferred ruling on \nwhether the two victims would \nbe entitled to \nrelief, pending development of a  fuller \nevidentiary record. id. \nTwo other victims, \nwho arc in many respects similarly \nsituated to the current victims, \nnow \nwish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage \nwill not cause any delay and \ntheir joinder in this case is the \nmost expeditious manner in which to \npursue their rights. Because \nthe \nbackground regarding their abuse is relevant to the \nCourt's assessment of whether to allow \nthem to join, their circumstances \nare recounted here briefly. \nJane \nDoe \n#3's \nCircumstances \n2 \n004289 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021555\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 280 Entered on FLSD \nDocket 01/02/2015 Page 3 \nof \n14 \nAs \nwith Jane Doe 41 and Jane Doe \n#2, Jane Doc \n#3 \nwas repeatedly \nsexually abused by \nEpstein. The Government \nthen concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of \nits NPA from Jane \nDoc #3, in violation of her rights under \nthe \nCVRA. If \nallowed to join this action, Jane Doc \n#3 \nwould prove the following: \nIn 1999, Jane Doc \n#3 \nwas approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the \nmain \nwomen \nwhom Epstein used to procure \nunder-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator \nin his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became \nknown to \nthe \ngovernment that \nMaxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein's \nsexual exploitation of minors, including Jane \nDoe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doc \n#3 \n(who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein's \nmansion in a  fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators \ncoerced dozens \nof other children (including Jane Doe 41 and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doc #3 \nbegan giving Epstein a  \"massage,\" Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a  sexual encounter, as \nthey had done with many other victims. Epstein \nthen became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and \nwith \nthe \nassistance of Maxwell convened her into what is \ncommonly referred to as a \"sex slave.\" \nEpstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave \nfrom about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to \nescape to a  foreign \ncountry and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From \n1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm \nBeach, but also in \nNew \nYork, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in \ninternational airspace on \nhis Epstein's private \nplanes, and elsewhere. \nEpstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to \npolitically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein's purposes in \"lending\" Jane Doe \n(along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with \nthem for \n3 \n004290 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021556\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n01/02/2015 Page 4 of 14 \nbusiness, personal, \npolitical, and financial gain, as well as to obtain \npotential blackmail \ninformation. \nOne \nsuch powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe 43 to have \nsexual \nrelations with was \nformer Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of F.pstein's \nand well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual \nrelations \nwith \nDershowitz on \nnumerous occasions while she \nwas a minor, not only in Florida \nbut \nalso on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to \nbeing a participant in the abuse \nof Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness \nto the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators. \nDershowitz would later play a  significant role in negotiating the NPA on \nEpstein's behalf. \nIndeed, Dershowitz \nhelped negotiate an agreement that provided \nimmunity from federal \nprosecution in the \nSouthern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but \nalso to \"any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein.\" NPA at 5. \nThus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an \nagreement with a \nprovision that provided protection \nfor himself against criminal prosecution in \nFlorida for \nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because \nthis broad immunity would have \nbeen controversial if \ndisclosed, \nDershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's defense team) and \nthe \nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein's victims and the \ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. \nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein's inner circle and a  co-conspirator in \nEpstein's sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity \ngranted by the NPA for the crimes she committed in Florida. In addition to \nparticipating in the \nsexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also \ntook numerous sexually explicit pictures \n4 \n10004291 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021557\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n280 Entered on \nFLSD Docket \n01/02/2015 Page 5 of 14 \nof underage girls \ninvolved in sexual \nactivities, including \nJane Doe #3. She \nshared these \nphotographs (which constituted \nchild pornography under \napplicable federal laws) \nwith Epstein. \nThe Government is \napparently aware of, and in \ncertain instances possesses \nsome of these \nphotographs. \nPerhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's \nsexual abuse ring, Maxwell had \ndirect \nconnections to other powerful individuals with whom \nshe could connect Epstein. For \ninstance, one such powerful individual Epstein \nforced Jane Doe 03 to have sexual relations with \nwas a member of the British Royal \nFamily, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3 \nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a  minor in three separate \ngeographical \nlocations: in \nLondon (at \nGhislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New \nYork, and on \nEpstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged \ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doc #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and \nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual \nabuse. Maxwell \nfacilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a \n\"madame\" for Epstein, thereby \nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doc #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual \npurposes. \nAnother person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost \nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 \nto Jean Luc \nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a  regular traveling \ncompanion, who had \nmany contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a \nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many \nyears and apparently was able to get U.S. \npassports for \nyoung girls to \"work\" as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as \n5 \n004292 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021558\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on \nFLED Docket 01/02/2015 Page 6 of 14 \nyoung as \ntwelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm \nthem out to his friends, \nespecially Epstein. Brunel would \noffer the girls \"modeling\" jobs. Many of the girls came from \npoor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and \nhe lured them in with a  promise of making \ngood money. Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal \nsexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with \nBrunel on \nnumerous occasions, at places including Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach, Little \nSt. James Island in the \nU.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other \nunderage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south \nof France, and California. \nEpstein also trafficked Jane \nDoe #3 for sexual purposes to many other \npowerful men, \nincluding numerous prominent American \npoliticians, powerful business \nexecutives, foreign \npresidents, a well-known \nPrime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein \nrequired Jane Doe #3 \nto describe the \nevents that \nshe \nhad with these men so that \nhe could potentially blackmail them. \nThe Government was \nwell aware of Jane Doc #3 \nwhen it was negotiating the NPA, as \nit \nlisted her as a \nvictim in the attachment to the \nNPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary \ninvestigation \nof Jane Doe \n#3's relationship to Epstein would \nhave revealed the fact that she had \nbeen \ntrafficked throughout the United \nStates and internationally for sexual purposes. \nNonetheless, the \nGovernment secretly negotiated a non\n-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any \nFederal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and \nhis co-conspirators. As \nwith Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe \n#2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution \nagreement \nfrom \nJane Doe #3 —  all in violation of her rights under the CVRA —  to avoid \nJane Doe #3 from \nraising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous \npublic light on Epstein \n6 \n004293 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021559\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n280 Entered on FLSD Docket \n01/02/2015 Page 7 of 14 \nand other \npowerful individuals and that would likely \nhave been prevented it from being \nconcluded in the secretive \nmanner in which it was. \nJane Doe #4's Circumstances \nif permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could \nprove at trial, that \nshe has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on \nthe \nfollowing: \nAs \nwith the other \nJane \nDoes, Jane \nDoe #4 \nwas repeatedly \nsexually \nabused \nby Epstein. In \nor around the summer of 2002, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-\nold child, was told by another one of Epstein's \nunderage minor sex abuse victims, that she could \nmake $300 \ncash by giving an old man a  massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe \n#4 (also a  minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein \nand scheduled Jane Doc #4 \nto go to Epstein's house to give him a  massage. During \nthat call, Epstein himself got on \nthe \nphone (a means of interstate \ncommunication) with Jane Doe #4, asking \nher personally to come to \nhis mansion in Palm Beach. \nJane Doc #4 \nthen went to Epstein's mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstcin's large \nbathroom by one of Epstein's assistants. Shortly \nthereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and lay face \ndown on the table and told Jane Doc #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doc #3 her \nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed \nillegal \nsexual acts against Jane Doc #4 on many occasions. \nEpstein used a means of interstate \ncommunication (i.e., a cell \nphone) \nto arrange for these \nsexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal \njet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doc \n#4. \n7 \n004294 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021560\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n280 Entered on FLSD \nDocket 03./02/2015 Page 8 \nof 14 \nThe acts Epstein committed \nagainst Jane Doe #4, constituted \nnumerous federal sex \noffenses, some of \nwhich do not carry a statute of limitations and \nthus are not time-barred. See 18 \nU.S.C. §  3283. And these offenses were the \nkinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of Florida were pursuing \nin 2007. So far as Jane Doc \n#4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney's Office made no serious effort to \nlocate her. Instead, after identifying approximately \nforty separate underage sexually abused \nvictims, and apparently preparing a  53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the \nexistence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 —  unidentified and not interviewed —  it entered into a \nnon-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein's federal crimes against these victims. \nThis is contrary to the Government's normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It \nalso violated Jane Doe \n#4's rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a \n\"reasonable\" right to confer with the U.S. Attorney's Office before they entered into an \nagreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against \nher. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). \nMOTION FOR JOINDER \nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 now both \nmove to join this action filed by Jane Doe #1 and \nJane Doc #2, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 21 provides that \n\"[ojn motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add . .. a party.\" Rule 21 \n\"grants the court broad discretion to permit a change in the parties \nat any stage of a litigation.\" \nFord v. Air Line Pilots Ass 'n 268 F. Supp. \n2d 271, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal quotation \nomitted). The new victims should be allowed to join the current victims in this action under Rule \n21. \n8 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021561\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 280 Entered on FLSD \nDocket 01/02/2015 \nPage 9 of 14 \nMe new victims will establish at trial \nthat the Government violated their CVRA \nrights in \nthe same way as it violated the rights of \nthe other victims. The new victims' \nparticipation in this \ncase is important because it appears that \nthe Government intends to raise a  factual defense that \nsomehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 \nproperly informed of what was happening in \nthe criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims \nall testify consistently that they were not \nproperly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for \na CVRA \nviolation. \nIn addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation is  relevant to a  defense the \nCourt has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims' \nrequest for rescission of \nthe NPA \"implicates a  fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be \nconsidered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the \nrelevant \nprosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims -   including an assessment of the \nallegation of a deliberate \nconspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to \nkeep the victims \nin the dark on the pendency of \nnegotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until \nwell \nafter the \nfact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a \nfait accompli.\" DE \n189 at  12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doc #4's participation in this case will \nhelp to show what the \"entire interface\" was between the Government and the victims and thus \nto respond to the Government's estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be \npreparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the \nGovernment to the victim's \nsummary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments \nagainst the \nvictim's position). \n9 \n004296 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021562\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 \nEntered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 10 \nof 14 \nJane \nDoe #3's and Jane Doe \n#4's \nparticipation is \nalso directly relevant to the discovery \ndisputes currently pending in this case. \nThe Government has raised various relevancy objections \nto the documents that Jane Doe \n#1 \nand \nJane Doc #2 are attempting to obtain. The current \nvictims have responded by explaining how these \ndocuments are relevant, including explaining \nhow \nthese documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and \nsocial connections to secure a  favorable plea deal. as well as provide proof of the Government's \nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims' claims in an effort to \nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims' knowledge. See, e.g., \nDE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doc #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation will help prove the relevancy of \nthese requests, as well as the need for those \nrequests. \nOne clear example is \nRequest for Production No. 8. which seeks \ndocuments regarding \nEpstein's lobbying efforts to persuade the \nGovernment to give him a  more favorable plea \narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, \nincluding efforts on his behalf by Prince \nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doc \n#1 \nand \nJane \nDoe \n#2 \nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their \nallegations that, after Epstein signed the \nnon-prosecution \nagreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and \npolitical \nconnections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See, \ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at  16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person \nknowledge of \nEpstein's connection with some of these powerful people and thus how Epstein might have used \nthem to secure favorable treatment. \nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will \nsimply join in motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the \n10 \n004297 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021563\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered \non FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 11 \nof 14 \nnew victims will simply join in \na  single summary judgment motion that the \ncurrent victims \nanticipate filing after discovery has been \ncompleted. \nNor will adding the \nnew victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this \nCourt is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject \nthe Government's assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265 \n(victims' reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not \nsock \nany additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.2\nAccordingly, the \nUnited States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case. \nThe CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce \nrights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this \nmotion, the result might be \nthat the new victims would \nthen be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, \nwhich would \nthen \npossibly proceed on a separate litigation \ntrack. Rather than require duplicative \nlitigation, \nthe Court should simply \ngrant their motion to join. \nJane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 \nsupport the joinder motion. Counsel for \nthe victims have \ndiscussed this motion with the Government at \nlength in an effort to avoid any need to file a \nsubstantive pleading on the \nissue. \nCounsel for the \nvictims asked the Government during the \nsummer for its position on joinder. \nThe Government, however, took the matter under \nadvisement for months. Ultimately, after several inquiries \nfrom victims counsel, the \nGovernment indicated without explanation that it opposes this \nmotion. Counsel for the victims \nhas requested a  meeting with the Government on this issue, \nwhich will hopefully occur in \n2 \nJane \nDoe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the \nrecord of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302's should be only a \nfew \npages \nlong. \n11 \n004298 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021564\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered \non FLSD Docket \n01/02/2015 Page 12 of \n14 \nJanuary. In the meantime, however, counsel for the victims believe that it is no longer \nappropriate to delay filing this motion and accordingly file it at this time. Because the \nGovernment is \napparently \nopposing \nthis motion, Jane Doc #3 and Jane \nDoc #4 have \ndescribed \nthe \ncircumstances surrounding their claims so that the Court has appropriate \ninformation to rule \non the motion. \n12 \n004299 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEFTA00021565\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on \nFLED Docket 01/02/2015 Page 13 of 14 \nCONCLUSION \nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be allowed to join this action, pursuant to Rule 21 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their joinder should be conditioned on the requirement \nthat they not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2.
