Another one of my clients who is an Epstein victim has agreed to fly to New York to meet with you on \nAugust 19 in the afternoon. Is that time period still available? If so what time would work for you? I do have her \ndriver's license and I know she would like to fly with me on the Delta flight that I am taking on Sunday from L.A. to \nNew York. If you will have time to meet with her your federal agent who handles travel may contact my assistant, \nDiane , tomorrow to arrange the details of my client's trip. \nGloria Allred \nAllred, Maroko \n& Goldberg \nLos Angeles, CA 90048 \nwww.amglaw.corn \nwww. gloriaallred. \ncorn \n<image003.jpg> \n<image004.png> \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:22 AM \nTo: Gloria Allred \nCc: \nSubject: RE: August 19th \nThanks for letting us know.
