If there's any way to get these searches run before you're off \ntomorrow, I'd be very grateful. \nWe need the following search terms run on all of the non-privileged files contained in the three folders entitled \n\"NYC024328\", \"NYC024349\", and \"NYC024350\" in the \"US v Epstein (SW Returns)\" database on Relativity: \n•  Please run the search terms listed in the attached Word document entitled \"Epstein Responsiveness Search Terms\". \nPlease tag all hits with a tag entitled \"Potentially Responsive\". I believe you modified these search terms when \nrunning them on a larger data set in the same database. Please feel free to use those modified terms on this \nsearch as well if that is easier. \n•  For all of the email addresses listed in the attached Word document entitled \"Epstein Responsiveness Email \nAddresses,\" please pull any email with any of those addresses in the header (TO, FROM, CC, or 8CC). Please tag all \nof those emails with the same tag entitled \"Potentially Responsive\". \nPlease let me know when these searches are complete, so that I can review the Potentially Responsive hits. Once we have \nreviewed, we will let you know what should be produced from that database. \nThanks very much, \n(USANYS) < \nEFTA00030525",
