There are still people that think this was an absolute ruse \nand he's sitting pretty in another part of the world.\" \n4. Prosecutors wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could be potential \nwitnesses in that ongoing investigation \nOn Fri, Oct 25, 2019 at 12:06 PM Pervaiz Shallwani <pshallwani(itgrnail.com> wrote: \nHey, \nA few things we chatted about: \nI. If you can give a nod on any of this: Representatives from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office traveled to \nFlorida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein's victims and their counsel. The staffers, who worked in \nthe victim services unit, held a similar meeting in New York on Oct. 23. \n2. Where do things stand with forfeiture with Epstein's assets? \n3. Dawn's new email address? \n4. ANYTHING that can be done about getting emails from you guys. I have given 2 email addresses and the \nonly email I receive is the guidance email in the morning to one of my email accounts. \nThanks. \nPervaiz Shallwani \nBrooklyn.
