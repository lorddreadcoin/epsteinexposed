Also, FBI exported 4 more victims, attached are \ntheir names. Is it ok to notify them? \nThank you, \nVictim-Witness Assistant \nU.S. Attorney's Office —  SDNY \n1 St. Andrews Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nOffice: \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, August 01, 2019 5:44 PM \nTo: \nI <,•; \nSubject: RE: US v. Epstein - Status Hearing Notification \nNo worries! No need to apologize. VNS is tricky. A notification is formatted via a template, kind of like a template in Word. \nThere are certain sections where you can edit but then there are other areas where you can't because that's how it was \nmade by the programmer. Hope that makes sense... \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, August 01, 2019 5:40 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: US v. Epstein - Status Hearing Notification \nC \nGot it, thanks. In the letters that went out, there are several edits we made that were applied to these letters, so I'm \nwondering why it is we can change some parts of the letters and not others? \nApologies if I'm misunderstanding how the VNS system works. Thanks. \nFrom: (USANYS) •it> \nSent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 5:25 PM \nTo: \nI <I>; \nSubject: RE: US v.

The other edits \ncan't be done due to the template in VNS which can't be changed. Frustrating I know, but I did my best to make it look \ndecent. Let me know if I can send it out. Thanks and sorry again! \nFrom: \n4:)* \nSent: Thursday, August 01, 2019 4:24 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: US v. Epstein - Status Hearing Notification \nHi \nThanks. A few things: \n< \n>; \n• In the case caption, please delete \"defendant(s),\" so that it does not read \"defendant(s) Jeffrey Epstein\". I'm not \nsure if that's the form language, but it looks like a typo. \n• Regarding the hearing information, there are several other court dates. I'll forward you the scheduling order so \nthat you can add them. \n• Please swap out this language: \nBecause of the Court's schedule, hearing dates could change on very short notice. If you plan on attending, \nyou may want to call the VNS Call Center or check the website to confirm the date and time. Please note, \nthere is a 24-hour delay in information transfer to the website. \nAnd replace it with this language: \nIf you plan on attending, please call me at 917-301-6861 in case there are any last minute changes. \nEFTA00021152\n\nThanks) \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 4:11 PM \nTo: \n< \nSubject: US v.
