One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. \nThe limitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as \nquickly as I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration \ndate, so that took priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load \nfiles, but the process is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK \nright now. \nSenior Forensic Examiner \ndesk \nOn Sea2019 3:13 PM, ' \nHey=, \n.
