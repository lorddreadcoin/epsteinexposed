Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nThe Silvio J. Moll° Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York. New York 10007 \nOctober 15, 2021 \nFor the reasons stated in this letter, the Court finds that \nthere is good cause for any motion under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 412 to be filed no later than October 27, 2021. \nAny response will be due November 1, 2021. Any hearing \nwill tentatively be scheduled for November 5, 2021. \nAdditional details will be provided if and when any motions \nare filed. SO ORDERED. \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated \nOctober 14, 2021 (Dkt. No. 347) ordering the Government to respond to the defendant's October \n14, 2021 letter regarding the deadline for filing a motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412 (Dkt. \nNo. 345). In particular, the defendant wrote the Court to \"confirm that November 15, 2021 is the \ndeadline for [her] to file a motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412.\" (Dkt. No. 345). \nFederal Rule of Evidence 412(a)(1) provides that in a case involving allegations of sexual \nmisconduct, \"evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior\" is \ninadmissible. The Rule \"'aims to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, \npotential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of \nintimate sexual \ndetails.\"' \nUnited States v. Rivera, 799 F.3d 180, 184 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. \nR. Evid. 412 advisory committee's note). \"The exclusion, however, is not absolute\" as Rule 412(b) \nprovides certain exceptions to this general prohibition in criminal cases. Id. Rule 412 provides \nthat \"[i]f a  party intends to offer evidence under Rule 412(b),\" the party must file a  motion \nspecifically describing the evidence and the purpose of the evidence, Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(A), \niiir10/15/21 \nEFTA00011157\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 351 Filed 10/15/21 Page 2 of 4 \nPage 2 \nand must \"do so at least 14 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time.\" \nFed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). This language plainly gives the Court authority to \nset a \"different\" time, not necessarily a  \"later\" time, to require the defense to file a  Rule 412 \nmotion. See, e.g., Order, United States v. Andrews, No. 19 Cr. 131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2020) \n(Dkt. No. 287) (setting a Rule 412 deadline of February 13, 2020, for a March 9, 2020 trial); Order, \nUnited States v. Rivera, No. 19 Cr. 131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2020) (Dkt. No. 384) (setting a \nRule 412 deadline of October 15, 2020, for a November 9, 2020 trial); United States v. Dupigny, \n18 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2019) (Dkt. No. 202) (requiring a  \"finalized proffer of \nevidence\" the defense sought to admit under Rule 412 by December 6, 2019, in advance of a \nJanuary 13, 2020 trial); United States v. Backman, 817 F.3d 662, 669-70 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(concluding that district court did not abuse its discretion when setting Rule 412 deadline more \nthan 14 days before trial and denying request to amend the motion less than 14 days before trial); \nUnited States v. Valenzuela, No. Cr. 07-11, 2008 WL 2824958, at *4 n.12 (CD. Cal. July 21, \n2008) (\"Good cause exists to advance the deadline for filing a Rule 412(c) motion by eleven days \ngiven the complex nature of the action and the volume of evidence that will likely be presented at \ntrial.\"); see also Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 23 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 5377 (2d \ned. 2020) (explaining that the text of Rule 412(c)(1)(B) \"suggests that the court might require that \nthe motion be filed earlier than 14 days before trial or might permit the motion to be brought later, \nincluding during trial.\"). Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the express terms \nof Rule 412 contemplate that the Court can set an earlier briefing schedule. \nA deadline more than two weeks in advance of trial is consistent with the Rule's procedural \nrequirements. Before admitting evidence under Rule 412, the Court \"must conduct an in camera \nhearing and give the victim and parties a right to attend and be heard.\" Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2). \nEFTA00011158\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 351 Filed 10/15/21 Page 3 of 4 \nPage 3 \n\"Given that the hearing provides an opportunity for the Rule 412 movant to detail the evidence he \nseeks to admit and for the parties to discuss the propriety of its admission, the notice requirement \nshould be seen as serving two purposes: I) aiding the Court in determining the threshold matter of \nwhether a hearing is necessary; and 2) providing sufficient notice to the nonmovant and victim \nalike to prepare for and argue against the necessity of any in camera hearing.\" United States v. \nSmith, 19 Cr. 324 (BAH), 2020 WL 5995100, at *19 (D.D.C. Oct. 9, 2020). \nHere, the Government produced to the defense a witness list, Giglio material, Jencks Act \nmaterial, and notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) by October 11, 2021, or 7 weeks \nin advance of trial. The Government understands that the Court's schedule for early disclosure of \nJencks Act material and early motions in limine was designed, in part, to ensure that any significant \nissues are resolved substantially in advance of trial. The Government respectfully submits that the \nCourt has \"good cause\" to set an earlier deadline in order to ensure that any issues stemming from \nRule 412 litigation are resolved in a timely fashion in advance of trial, including the need for the \nGovernment to investigate and meaningfully respond to such sensitive and important issues. See \nSmith, 2020 WL 5995100, at *19. \nAdditionally, a deadline of 14 days before trial for the defense's Rule 412 motion is not \npractical in light of the trial schedule. Under the defense schedule, the defense will file their Rule \n412 motion on November 15, 2021, and give notice to both the Government and victims. See Fed. \nR. Evid. 412(c)(1)(D). At some point over the following two weeks—during jury selection and \nthe Thanksgiving holiday—the Government will respond to the motion, and the Court \"must \nconduct an in camera hearing\" that gives the parties and the victims the right to be heard. See Fed. \nR. Evid. 412(c)(2). Given that there are multiple victim witnesses and the defense has not yet \nnotified the Government whether it intends to make a Rule 412 motion as to one or more than one \nEFTA00011159\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 351 Filed 10/15/21 Page 4 of 4 \nPage 4 \nof them, there may be a  need for multiple such hearings. The Court must then adjudicate the \nmotion before trial starts or during trial. There is no reason to impose the defense's \ncramped \nschedule on the Court or the parties, particularly where the motion concerns such sensitive issues. \nFor these reasons, the Government respectfully submits that the Court should maintain the \nOctober 18, 2021 in lintine deadline as the deadline for the defense to file a motion under Rule \n412, or order that any Rule 412 motion be made, at the latest, by October 25, 2021. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: 5/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nCc: Defense counsel (By ECF) \nEFTA00011160",
