He said that getting courtroom connect is not going to happen without a signed order from the judge. He \nrecommended getting it submitted sooner rather than later to leave time for logistics to be worked out. Would it be \npossible to submit a proposed order and request to Judge Nathan soon, tonight or tomorrow? I've drafted one (attached) \nusing the language •  used in his, which I forwarded below. Let me know what you think or if you need anything from me, \nthanks. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 2021 6:23 PM \nTo: \n<.>; \n(USANYS) \nI < \nSubject: FW: Courtroom connect \n>; \nFYI, I am going to check in with tomorrow about the procedure for courtroom connect internet (I flagged it for \nher yesterday but forgot to check in this afternoon), but it looks like we will need to send a letter and proposed order to \nthe judge to approve it before coordinating with the tech folks who install and make it happen. If this is in fact what we \nneed to do, which I'll again check with about tomorrow, I think we should try and send such a letter/proposed \norder tomorrow (to ideally get it approved as soon as possible and a tech check scheduled for before Thanksgiving). \nFrom: Mark,.
