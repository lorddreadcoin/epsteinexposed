Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDefendant's Good Faith, Non-Frivolous Objections to Proffered Co-Conspirator \nHearsay Statements \nDear Counsel, \nPursuant to the Court's November 1, 2021 Order we write to note our good faith \nobjections to certain categories of alleged co-conspirator hearsay statements, and representative \nexamples: \nRegarding the first, third, and fourth' designated categories, there are two issues for \nconferral. First, we assume that these proffered statements are limited to those individuals \nspecifically identified by the government as \"minor victims\" in the indictment or correspondence \nto defense counsel dated October 11, 2021. There were many alleged minor victims in the \nSouthern Florida state and federal investigations. To the extent that the government intends to \ninclude statements made to other alleged \"minor victims\" not specifically identified, Ms. \n\"Statements made by Epstein to friends and Family of Minor Victims,\" \"Statements \nmade by CC-2 to friends and Family of Minor Victims,\" and \"Statements made by Jeffrey \nEpstein to the Minor Victims or in their presence.\" \nEFTA00014982\n\nNovember 8, 2021 \nPage 2 \nMaxwell objects. In addition, these categories do not contain any temporal limitations and we \nobject to any statements allegedly made outside the dates of the alleged conspiracy. \nCategory 2, \"Statements made by Jeffrey Epstein to his employees\" appears to, primarily, \nrelate to statements that post-date any alleged conspiracy. The first exemplar is a statement \nallegedly from Epstein to CC-1 claiming that Ms. Maxwell \"used to find girls for him.\" This \nstatement, or statements like it, cannot have been made either in the course of or in furtherance \nof any conspiracy at issue here and are no more than \"idle chatter.\" United States v. Lieberman, \n637 F.2d 95, 102 (2d Cir.1980) (challenged testimony \"smack[ed] of nothing more than casual \nconversation about past events. It is difficult to envision how it would have furthered the \nconspiracy\"). Similarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-1 \nto \"help someone who was coming to take the computers....\" Again, this statement does not \nappear to be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. \nUnited States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Kruleivitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949). We \nassume the third example relates to the time period alleged in the indictment. To the extent it \ndoes not we object. \nBest Regards, \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nEFTA00014983",
