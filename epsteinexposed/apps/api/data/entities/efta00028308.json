Berman, said. \nMr. Epstein, 66, is accused of engaging in sex acts with dozens of vulnerable minors, some as young as 14, \nduring naked massage sessions, then paying them hundreds of dollars in cash. He also asked some of the \ngirls to recruit other underage girls, the indictment said. \n\"In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations \nincluding New York and Palm Beach,\" the indictment said. \nMr. Berman's decision to seek an indictment in Manhattan was an implicit rebuke to the decision by \nprosecutors in Miami in 2008 to enter an agreement with Mr. Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal \nprosecution and a possible life sentence. \nUnder that deal, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and spent about a year in a Palm \nBeach jail. He was permitted to leave the facility six days a week to work. \nMr. Berman made it clear his office was not bound by the agreement, which was overseen by Alexander \nAcosta, then the United States attorney in Miami who is now President Trump's secretary of labor. \n\"That agreement, by its terms, only binds the Southern District of Florida,\" Mr. Berman said. \nThe agreement has been examined in a series of reports in The Miami Herald and is being challenged in \ncourt. A federal judge ruled earlier this year Mr. Epstein's accusers should have been consulted about the \ndeal before it was signed. \nThe indictment unsealed in Manhattan on Monday said that from 2002 to 2005 Mr. Epstein and his \nemployees engaged in a sex trafficking scheme, bringing underage girls to his Upper East Side mansion \nand his palatial compound in Palm Beach, Fla., to engage in sex acts with him. \nThe indictment said Mr. Epstein used employees and assistants to arrange sexual rendezvous with at least \none girl at his New York residence and two at his home in Palm Beach. \nEFTA00028309\n\nMr. Epstein is accused of having the girls perform nude massages, at which point he would masturbate and \ntouch their genitals with his hands or with sex toys. \nThe girls were paid hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter and, once recruited, were asked to \nreturn to the mansion several times, where they were abused again, the indictment said. Mr. Epstein, the \ncourt documents read, \"created a similar network of minor girls to victimize\" in Florida. \n\"This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and involved dozens of young girls, some as young as 14,\" \nMr. Berman said. \"The alleged behavior shocks the conscience.\" \n[Read the indictment.] \nThe charges unsealed Monday by the Southern District of New York signal a prosecution that some of his \naccusers have been awaiting for years. \nAccusations of pedophilia and sexual predation have dogged Mr. Epstein for decades. And now, in the \n#MeToo era, his case has been held up as a prime example of insulated, powerful men avoiding \naccountability. \nFor more than a decade, Mr. Epstein, a hedge fund manager, avoided a lengthy prison sentence, largely \nbecause of the agreement his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in 2008. \nMr. Epstein's social circle is filled with other high-profile connections, including to former President Bill Clinton, Prince \nAndrew of Britain and a host of others. \nIn 2002, Mr. Trump described Mr. Epstein as \"a terrific guy.\" \n\"He's a lot of fun to be with,\" Mr. Trump told New York Magazine. \"It is even said that he likes beautiful \nwomen as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\" \nOn Saturday, F.B.I. agents and New York Police Department officers used a crow bar to force open the wooden doors of \nMr. Epstein's East 71st Street mansion. \nEFTA00028310\n\nThe charges unsealed Monday mirror those that federal prosecutors had prepared in Miami against Mr. \nEpstein more than a decade ago. In 2005, law enforcement officials there investigated Mr. Epstein after the \nparents of one of his accusers reported an incident to the police. \nAs first reported in The Miami Herald last year, prosecutors had prepared a 53-page indictment accusing \nMr. Epstein of being a sexual predator. But those charges were shelved in 2008 after an eleventh-hour deal \nwas reached between the United States attorney's office in Miami and Mr. Epstein's lawyers. \nThe plea agreement granted Mr. Epstein immunity from federal prosecution and let him plead guilty to two \nprostitution charges in state court. Federal prosecutors arranged for the plea deal to be kept secret from Mr. \nEpstein's accusers until it was finalized in court. \nIn April, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had violated the law in offering the plea agreement without \ninforming Mr. Epstein's accusers. The Justice Department also opened a probe into the incident in \nFebruary. \nPublic Affairs \nUnited States Department of Justice \nU.S. Attorne s Office Southern District of New York \nI Mobile: I  Press Office \nEFTA00028311",
