By the \ntime the vendor emailed us the files, I'd already given the original drive to=o start copying to a new drive. \n=  if I send you that data, would you be able to add that to the copy as well? \n\"ii,\nhanks \nFrom:  \nSent: Frida October 9  2020 10:23 AM \nTo \nCc. \nSubject: RE: Hard drive copy \ndid you put the data that we got from the vendor on the hard drive.

We received another hard drive that is to be loaded onto Relativity. Would you please make a copy of \nthis drive (I'll bring it down momentarily) so we can send it to Rao upload onto the USvEpstein database on relativity? \nThe password for the drive is: ScanningMaxwell!99 \nasks that the drive NOT be sent out to him until we get the overlay files we need from the vendor. Once the drive is \ndone copying, I can pick it up and keep it at my desk until the overlay files arrive from the vendor. \n•Thanks so much, I'll be in the office today until around 3PM, and I'll be working remotely until Tuesday morning.
