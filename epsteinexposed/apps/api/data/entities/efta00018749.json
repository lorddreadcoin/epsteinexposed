Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: Request to Modify Protective Order (UNDER SEAL)' \nUnited States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, t.c \nJeffrey Paglloca \n150 East 10th Avenue \nDenver, Colorado 80203 \nrti 303.831.7364 FX 303.832.2628 \nwww.hmflaw.com \njpaglucaahmflaw.com \nDear Judge Nathan, \nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell, pursuant to paragraph 18 of this Court's Protective Order (Doc. \n# 36), requests that the Court enter an Order allowing her to refer to and file under seal in Giuffre \nv. Maxwell, 15-cv-5433 (LAP), and a related Second Circuit appeal, Giuffre v.  Maxwell, No. 20-\n2413 (the \"Other Matters\"), certain discovery materials produced by the government on August \n5, 2020. She also seeks to refer to (but not file) discovery materials produced by the government \non August 13, 2020, specifically the 90,000 pages of documents received from Boies Schiller & \nFlexner, which appears to include their entire civil file from the Giuffre case. 2\nDisclosure to the judicial officers in the Other Matters is necessary for fair determination of \nimportant issues impacting the privacy and due process rights of Ms. Maxwell and other third \nparties. The ten discrete items to be filed (\"the Material\") are not confidential and disclosure \nconfined to the Honorable Loretta Preska and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, under seal, \n'  Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file this Letter Motion under seal because it relates and refers to \ndiscovery materials deemed Confidential under the terms of the Protective Order in this case. \n'Counsel for Ms. Maxwell have not conducted a document by document comparison of the \n90,000 pages with documents in their possession related to the Maxwell civil matters but presumes they \nare the same. Paragraph 16 of the Protective Order in this case exempts information obtained \"from a \nsource other than the government.\" Because Ms. Maxwell has not yet compared the two sets of \ndocuments she makes this request out of an abundance of caution. \nEFTA00018749\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage 2 \nwill not prejudice the government? The items to be referred to (and not filed) are confidential; \naccordingly, referring to them under seal in the Other Matters will not prejudice the government. \nRelevant Facts and Procedural History \nThe defamation action and its Protective Order- Giuffre v. Maxwell \nIn 2015, 'alleged in a civil suit that Ms. Maxwell defamed her, based on a \nstatement from Ms. Maxwell's attorney-hired press agent generally denying as \"untrue\" and \n\"obvious lies'as allegations that Ms. Maxwell participated in a scheme causing her to be \n\"sexually abused and trafficked\" by Jeffrey Epstein. Given the amount of personal, confidential \nmaterial and information sought in discovery, the district court entered a stipulated Protective \nOrder protecting confidential information from public disclosure. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-\n7433 (Doc. # 62).4 The language agreed upon, and made an order of the district court, \nspecifically excluded an exception for law enforcement. Ms. Maxwell shortly thereafter \nsubmitted to a deposition in reliance on the Protective Order; she also was compelled to — and \ndid —  sit for a second deposition in July 2016. A year later and literally days before trial, the \nparties agreed to a settlement of the defamation claim and the case was dismissed. \nThe Jane Doe 43 matter \nOn January 26, 2017, plaintiff Jane Doe 43 sued various individuals including Ms. Maxwell. A \nProtective Order substantially similar to the Protective Order entered in Giuffre v. Maxwell was \nentered by Magistrate Judge Netburn on November 29, 2018.5 That matter was settled and \ndismissed on December 20, 2018. Jane Doe 43 also was represented by BSF, the same lawyers \nwho represent \nThe Materials to be filed are attached, under seal, as exhibits 1-10. Although marked by the \ngovernment as \"Confidential,\" the Materials are not \"Confidential\" as that term has been defined by the \nSecond Circuit. They consist of ex pane pleadings filed by the government, ex pane transcripts, and ex \npane rulings. Boies, Schiller & Flexner (\"BSF') lawyers, cooperating with the government, are aware of \nthe Material. The Second Circuit has characterized these types of documents as \"judicial documents\" with \na presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell \nobjected to the government's Confidential designation, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order, and \nrequested that the government withdraw the designation. The Court does not need to decide the issue of \nwhether the Material is confidential at this time given that Ms. Maxwell seeks only to provide the \nMaterial to judicial officers under seal as information necessary to fairly decide pending issues in those \ncases. \n4 Plaintiff originally proposed protective order language that would have allowed for a \"law \nenforcement\" exception. In particular, Paragraph l(a)4 of the draft proposed that \"CONFIDENTIAL \ninformation shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case and \nany related matter, including but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement.\" See Giuffre v. \nMaxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1078-4 at 4). Ms. Maxwell and her counsel rejected this proposed language \nbecause of her concerns that plaintiff and her lawyers were acting as either express or de facto agents of \nthe government. \n5 \nSee Ex. 4 at p. 7. \nEFTA00018750\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage 3 \nThe motion to unseal and the first appeal \nOne year after Giuffre v. Maxwell was dismissed and closed, the Miami Herald sought to reopen \nthe case and to unseal every sealed filing on the district court docket. The district court denied \nthe motion to unseal. The Miami Herald appealed on September 28, 2018. \nOn July 3, 2019 the Second Circuit reversed Judge Sweet's ruling. Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d \n41, 44-45 (2d Cir. 2019). Upon the issuance of the mandate, on August 9, 2019, it largely \nunsealed the summary judgment materials to the public and the press and remanded the case to \nthe district court to conduct a particularized review of the remaining records. Id. at 53-54. \nThe remand and the unsealing process. \nOn July 9, the Giuffre case was assigned to the Honorable Loretta Preska who was charged with \nthe difficult and time consuming task of sorting through thousands of filings, determining what \ndocuments were \"judicial,\" what were not, determining the process to notify the hundreds of \nnon-parties about their right to object to the disclosure of their confidential information, and \nimplementing a protocol for maintaining or unsealing the sealed status of thousands of pages of \nmaterial. Judge Preska sought input from the various Does, the lawyers for primarily \nSigrid McCawley, a partner at BSF, and counsel for Ms. Maxwell. Judge Preska was obligated \nby the Brown Court first to identify what was or was not a \"judicial document\"; second, to \ndetermine the presumption of access to the document; and third, to identify and weigh numerous \nfactors for or against unsealing a judicial document. Since August 2019, this process has \nconsumed hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyer, court, and staff hours. \nOn July 23, 2020, Judge Preska, over Ms. Maxwell's objection, ordered the unsealing of her \nApril 2016 deposition transcript and the deposition transcript of John Doe 1. On July 30, 2020, \nMs. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit and an emergency motion with the \nSecond Circuit to stay the unsealing order pending appeal. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, \nDoc. # 10 (2d. Cir.) (Maxwell Emergency Motion for Stay). When Judge Preska ordered the \nunsealing of Ms. Maxwell's deposition on July 23 and denied Ms. Maxwell's motion to \nreconsider on July 30, she apparently did not know that, as described below, Chief Judge \nMcMahon had already granted an ex pane request from the government to obtain Ms. Maxwell's \ndeposition (among thousands of other confidential and sealed materials that were protected under \nthe Protection Order from disclosures to non-parties) and that Magistrate Judge Netburn had \ndenied such a request from the government. Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys did not know \nanything about the government's request for access to these materials. \nOn July 31, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed Judge Preska's order unsealing Ms. Maxwell and \nJohn Doe \n1's \ndeposition transcripts. The Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule. Ms. \nMaxwell's opening brief is due on August 20, 2020. Oral argument is September 22, 2020. \nThe Material \nThe government apparently contacted BSF at some time before February 2019 while the Second \nCircuit appeal of Judge Sweet's order was pending. Based on some discussion with an as-yet \nunidentified BSF lawyer, the government served BSF with a subpoena to produce (apparently) \nall the BSF litigation files pertaining to both civil litigations. Ms. Maxwell was not served with \nEFTA00018751\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage 4 \nany subpoena. According to the government, \"although [BSF] would not otherwise contest \ncompliance with the Subpoena, [BSF] believe[d] that the Protective Order preclude[d] [BSF] \nfrom complying.\" See Exhibits 1 at p. 2 II 3 and 2, q 5. \nIn or about February 28, 2019 the government first applied to Judge Sweet for relief. The \ngovernment pressed its request in late March 2019 to Chief Judge McMahon and in April to \nMagistrate Judge Netburn. During these ex parte proceedings, the government made numerous \nunchallenged factual assertions. To Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, no one disclosed the pendency of \nthese applications to any judicial officer associated with the appeal or the unsealing process. \nCertainly, no one -- not the government, any court, or any lawyer at BSF -- disclosed to Ms. \nMaxwell that, while the issues surrounding the unsealing of thousands of confidential documents \nwere being litigated in the Second Circuit, BSF and the government were secretly working \ntogether to \"modify\" the Protective Orders so that the government could gain access to the \nmaterials subject to the Protective Orders. \nOver the last year, none of the filings submitted to any court involved in the sanctioned, public \nunsealing process hints at the fact that, even though Ms. Maxwell and numerous Does were \ncontesting the release of the confidential information in the Second Circuit, BSF had already \nturned over (apparently) all of the confidential information to the government, as well as all of \nthe discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties. Ms. Maxwell assumes that, \nto this day, Judge Preska has never been told that the government was given all the material as \npart of the Martindell-avoidance, ex pane processes in front of Judges Sweet, McMahon, and \nNetbum. \nThe indictment with reference to sealed materials \nOn July 2, 2020, one day after Ms. Maxwell filed her Reply concerning the unsealing of \napproximately 5,000 pages of material in the civil matter including her deposition, the \ngovernment arrested Ms. Maxwell. On July 8, the government filed a superseding indictment \nalleging that Ms. Maxwell \"assisted, facilitated, and contributed\" to Epstein's abuse of minors. \nRegarding the civil action, the indictment alleges that in 2016 Ms. Maxwell made \"efforts to \nconceal her conduct\" by \"repeatedly provid[ing] false and perjurious statements\" in deposition \ntestimony. Superseding Indictment, Doc. # 17 at 29 II 8. \nMs. Maxwell first learned on August 7, 20206 how the government obtained the sealed \ntranscripts. On the two applications referenced above (one before Chief Judge McMahon and the \nother before Magistrate Judge Netburn), the two SDNY courts rendered a split decision. Judge \nMcMahon, based on many ex pane, but soon to be challenged, factual assertions granted the ex \n6 The first batch of discovery was provided by the government to NY counsel on August 5, 2020 \nin the late afternoon on a hard disk. Due to the time upload and securely transfer files, undersigned \ncounsel for Ms. Maxwell (also counsel for her in the Giuffre case) only received these materials at 11:38 \na.m. on Friday, August 7, 2020. \nEFTA00018752\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage \n5 \npane application. Magistrate Judge Netburn denied the application. Both courts reached different \nresults applying the same authority.' \nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell then learned, on August 14, 2020, that BSF has produced 90,000 pages \nof discovery from BSF, including their entire civil file comprised not only of sealed judicial \ndocuments but all of the discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties in the \nGiuffre case. As the Second Circuit has already held, much of the discovery was compelled, and \nresponses provided, based on the promise of confidentiality by the Giuffre Protective Order. See \nBrown, 929 F.3d 41, n. 22 & 51. \nThe pressing issue that necessitates the filing of this request concerns Ms. Maxwell's due process \nright to fairly litigate issues in the rapidly unfolding unsealing litigation and related appeal. \nThese issues, in turn, impact her rights as the accused in this matter, constitutionally presumed \ninnocent unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. \nThe Protective Order in this case \nThe Protective Order in this case prohibits the use of the discovery materials or confidential-\ndesignated materials \"for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this \naction\" absent mutual agreement in writing between the government and defense counsel or if \n\"modified by further order of the Court.\" Doc. # 36 at 1(a), 10(a), 18. Ms. Maxwell agreed to \nthat limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this \nCourt, that \"the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any \nmaterial they did not already possess,\" and therefore \"concerns defense counsel raises about \nfuture use in civil litigation are not likely to occur.\" Letter of Alex Rossmiller at 6 (Doc. # 33) \n(July 28, 2020). This Court relied on that representation in its ruling that government witnesses \nshould not be limited in their use of materials gained from the government in any related civil \nlitigation. Memorandum Op'n & Order at 3 (July 30, 2020). Yet as described above, the \ngovernment must have given a copy of the sealed order to BSF, BSF has now used that (or its \nomission) to their tactical advantage in the Giuffre unsealing process, and Ms. Maxwell is unable \nto respond to the judicial officers with the complete truth. \nParagraph 18 of the Protective Order permits modification by the Court. Further, any concerns \nthat the government may raise concerning their on-going grand jury investigation will be \nobviated by submission of these materials under seal in the other matters. \nThe reasons this Court should grant the request \nIn contravention of Martindell and its progeny, the government achieved modification of a valid \nprotective order entered in connection with settled civil litigation. Knowing that significant \nissues relating to the confidences and identities of multiple deponents and other innocents were \nbeing actively litigated, it appears that the government worked in tandem with BSF to secretly \nobtain tens of thousands of pages of confidential information, discovery, and sealed materials. \n7  The controlling authority relied on by both courts to reach opposite results is Martindell v. \nInternational Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979). \nEFTA00018753\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage 6 \nThere are at least three compelling reasons to modify the Protective Order. First, Judge Preska \nmight well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell's depositions if she knew how the government \nobtained it despite the Protective Order. We do not know what impact the government's \npossession of the BSF file may have on the carefully crafted unsealing process. Judge Preska has \njurisdiction over the Protective Order entered in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case. Issues related to the \nadministration of that Protective Order should be litigated in that forum. There is a compelling \nneed for Ms. Maxwell to be able to advise Judge Preska about the Material so that she and the \nnon-parties can fairly adjudicate the multiple issues being addressed in the unsealing process. \nJudge Preska might decide that disclosure to the government obviates the need for further \nanalysis of the remaining documents. \nThe partial secrecy surrounding the Material has also fundamentally undermined the fairness of \nthe adversarial process. Although the grand jury subpoena and government investigation were \nknown to opposing civil counsel BSF, they failed to move for a modification of the Protective \nOrder as contemplated by Martindell or disclose the material fact that these items had been \nhanded over to the government months ago. \nAny suggestion that BSF's obligations regarding candor to the tribunal was somehow limited by \nthe Fed. R. Crim.P. 6(e) is misplaced. \"The rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on \nwitnesses.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6, Advisory Committee Note to Subdivision 6(e)2. Indeed, \nMartindell expressly contemplated that an affected party would have the ability to move to quash \nany subpoena issued by a grand jury that would implicate his or her rights under a valid \nprotective order. Martindell, 524 F.2d at 294. Too many questions remain unanswered \nincluding exactly what was said between the government and BSF, when was it said, and \nprecisely what was turned over. In the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, certain orders entered by \nJudge Sweet restricted certain information to \"attorney eyes only.\" Without the ability to use the \nMaterial in the very limited fashion proposed Ms. Maxwell she is unfairly disadvantaged in the \nprocess. Moreover, instead of candidly revealing the fact of the subpoena and production, the \nBSF lawyers misleadingly suggested to the courts that Ms. Maxwell's concerns about an \ninvestigation were fabricated. \nSecond, following the revelation that the government had already obtained her deposition \nthrough an ex parte proceeding, Ms. Maxwell moved Judge Preska to temporarily stay the \nunsealing process. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1100). But because of the \nProtective Order in this case, Ms. Maxwell could not inform Judge Preska of what she knew. On \nAugust 12, Judge Preska denied the motion to stay, finding that: \"Given that Ms. Maxwell is not \nat liberty to disclose this new information because it is subject to the protective order in the \ncriminal action, . . . the Court has no reasonable basis to impose a stay.\" See Giuffre v. Maxwell, \n15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1103) Unless this Court modifies the Protective Order, Judge Preska will \ncontinue to remain in the dark, and Ms. Maxwell will be deprived of a fair opportunity to seek a \nstay of the unsealing process. The unsealing process in Giuffre is moving ahead to other \npleadings and exhibits, which include Ms. Maxwell's July 2016 deposition, also sealed and a \npart of the indictment in this case. Without modification of this Protective Order, Ms. Maxwell \nEFTA00018754\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, \n2020 \nPage 7 \nwill not be able to articulate her many concerns fully and fairly about the unsealing of that \ndeposition to Judge Preska. \nFurther, and as this Court knows, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case \npending the resolution of a related criminal case. See SEC v. \nBlaszczak, No. 17-CV-3919 (MN), \n2018 WL 301091, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2018) (granting motion to stay civil case and holding \nthat \"[a] district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are \nimminent or pending, and it will sometimes be prudential to do so\" (quoting Louis Vuitton \nMa!leder S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012))). Among other things, the stay \nvindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil \ncase and then \"conforming\" their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the \ncivil case. This concern is all the more real when one law firm, BSF, is in possession of these \nsealed materials representing accusers who may be witnesses in this case. The concern becomes \nexponentially magnified when the accusers are purporting to recall and relate memories for \nevents that allegedly occurred decades ago, and their credibility will be a central challenge at the \ncriminal trial. \nMs. Maxwell further anticipates the very immediate need to disclose the Materials to the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals in connection with her appeal of Judge Preska's unsealing order, since \nthe appellate opening brief due on August 20, 2020. Again, disclosure is necessary to correct the \nmisleading statements of opposing counsel and to frame the issues related to the unsealing \norders. \nNotably, the Material at issue is not accuser-related or sensitive in any regard. These ex parte \npleadings, hearings, and rulings are already known to the BSF lawyers. These materials, absent \nsealing, would enjoy a presumptive right of public access as judicial documents. Given that the \nMaterial has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court's \nOrder, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this \nCourt has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court's Protective \nOrder. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues \nrelated to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion \"that neither it \nnor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or \npermissible in civil cases.\" Doc. # 33 at 7. What Ms. Maxwell asks is that she be allowed to \ndisclose, under seal, the Material so that she can advise the appropriate arbiters about \ninformation already known to but not disclosed by her opponent. \nThe Protective Order in this case should not preclude judicial review by other Article III \njudicial officers \nThe Material, as part of the court files in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, may be judicially noticed by either Judge Preska or the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. See FRE 201; Hong Mai Sa v. Doe, 406 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir. 2005) (the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals can take judicial notice of its own files as well as those of the \ndistrict court); In re Pruitt, 72 B.R. 436, 440 (Banks. E.D.N.Y. 1987) (a bankruptcy court may \nEFTA00018755\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 17, 2020 \nPage \n8 \ntake judicial notice of the contents of its own files proceeding and the case in which an adversary \nproceeding arose).8\nThe Protective Order restricts Ms. Maxwell from asking the Courts to exercise this authority or \ndirect the Courts to the applicable miscellaneous actions. Given that the appellate court and \ndistrict court are authorized to review, and are capable of reviewing, the Material it is illogical \nand unjust that Ms. Maxwell be prohibited from referencing the Material in the civil litigation. \nConclusion \nMs. Maxwell requests that this Court modify the Protective Order to allow her to refer to and file \nunder seal in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-5433 (LAP), and the related Second Circuit appeal, \nGiuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, the Material at issue in this letter motion. \nRespectfully Submitted, \n(fc \nJe \nrey S.
