They said they appreciated our (the line \nassistants') willingness to hear their regular updates, but that they understand we're not in a position to negotiate, or \neven to provide feedback on the proposed plan for the fund, and so they'd like the opportunity to elevate that discussion \nand convey why they believe it would be in all parties' interests, including the victims, to engage in meaningful discussions \nabout a possible resolution. When you've spoken with =, could you please let us know whether she's willing to meet \nwith them? And we can convey the response, unless you and/or she would prefer to do so directly. If she is willing to \nmeet with them, they were hoping to put a date and time on the calendar as soon as is convenient for her after the \nholiday. \nthanks, \nM \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00029439",
