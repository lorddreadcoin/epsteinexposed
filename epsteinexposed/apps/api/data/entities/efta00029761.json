The \nfront was \nlocked on my approach \nand \nL \ncontinued traveling to \nthe west \nwhere there is \na small double \ngate \nwhich \nhas a sign, \n\"Please \nkeep \ngate closed\".  This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with \na \nswimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a \nwalk \nway \nleading to a dock which \nthen leads \ndirectly across to \nthe \nintra \ncoastal \nwaterway. \nThe dock was examined and checked for any \nsigns of a boat \ntying up or the presence of \nanyone that may have \nleft either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None \nwas found. It \nshould be \nnoted that the \nexterior \ntemperature was \n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small \ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer \nequipment as well as \nexercise \nequipment. \nNone of this \nhad been \ntouched or \ntampered with. \nOn the south side of the \nresidence in the southwest corner Mr. \nEpstein \nindicated that he believed this was the area that the \nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer \nroom \nand Florida type room and has three double \neliding \nglass \nwindows present. The eastern most and \nwestern most are \nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has \nthree glass panels and ie the only one of the three that \nhas a set of \n14 flagstones leading \ndirectly into \nthe \nroom. \nThe \nflooring ie a \nwood type of flooring and the \nwestern set of eliding doors \nwas \nfound ajar, however the eandy area directly \noutside of the door did \nnot indicate the presence \nof shoe prints or barefoot prints. The \ncentral window was found ajar \nand still had the lock mechanism \nin the extended outward position. The two windows believed to \nhave \nbeen entered \nwere \nprocessed \nand no \nlatent \nfingerprints \nwere \nfound on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the \neastern most. There was one mark \nthat was found that was not a \nfingerprint but could \nhave been made from either a cloth or a \nrubber glove \nand this was found on the interior \nof the central \nwindow. \nOnce inside the residence, the \nperson went over to a desk which is \na \nveneer covered \ndesk \nand there was a \nblack \nbag \nunderneath. The \nblack \nbag is approximately 2' \nlong by \n1' high \nand wan \nplaced on \nthe \nsouthern side of the interior of the \ndesk by the pedestal. The \nindividual knelt down and \npulled the case open and removed \ncash \nfrom \na \nwhite \nenvelope. \nThere were thirteen \none hundred \ndollar \nbills left, still in the \nenvelope when I examined it. The thirteen \none hundred \ndollar bills were \nremoved in the presence \nof net. \nMelnichok and \nMr. \nEpstein \nand they were \ncounted and turned \ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security \npurposes.
