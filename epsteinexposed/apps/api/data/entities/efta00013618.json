    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Special Master's Selection of Attorney Representative \nDate: Fri, 19 Oct 2007 20:04:05 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nFYI —  The story of the lawsuit filed by the girl in New York has made the national news (it was on Fox News several \ntimes today and it is on ABC News' website). I think that may be the real reason for the delay in the change of plea. Epstein's \ngroup is concerned that the guilty plea will be used against him in civil suits and they want to knock that lawsuit out before the \nguilty plea to deter others. One of the newspapers also reported that Epstein's camp had planted the false stories about girls \nwho \"just sat in his kitchen\" filing suit in an attempt to discredit the girls. \nFrom: \nSe \nTo \nSu orney Representative \nI'll contact him but before I do we'll chat. Jay was supposed to send me his comments to our proposed letter but I haven't \ngotten them yet. \nFrom \nSe • \nTo: \nSubje : \n:Special \nMas er s Selection of Attorney Representative \nWill you contact him or do you want me to do that? \nThanks. \nFrom: \nSeTo:\nSubject: RE: Special Master's Selection of Attorney Representative \n.as not been contacted yet. \nFrom: \nSent: nday, October 19, 2007 2:58 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Special Master's Selection of Attorney Representative \nHi a_ Has the special master made his selection yet? Several of the girls are getting calls from attorneys, and they \nhave been seeing all the news and are concerned. If the selection has not yet been made, may I call Judge Davis and ask \nthe status of the decision? \nThank you. \nEFTA00013618",
