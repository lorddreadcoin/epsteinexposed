In \nreviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you \nplease confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for \nany students at Interlochen? \nOur team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and \nwill have limited availability this week, but my colleagues and (both cc'd) should be able to \ncoordinate with you as needed. \nBest, \nMaurene \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \n212-637-2324 \nFrom: Jeff Jocks <jjocks@sondeeracine.com> \nSent: Thursday, February 6, 2020 2:46 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n< \nSubject: Re: Subpoena to Interlochen Center for \nthe Arts \nMaurene — \nReceipt confirmed. \nThanks, \nJeff \nJeffrey L.
