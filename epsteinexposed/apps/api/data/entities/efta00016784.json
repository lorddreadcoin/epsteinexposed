These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by \ninternational conventions\"). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal \nProcedure are a  reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international \nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: \"Treaties \nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an \nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by \nthe other party\"). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may \nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or \nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France \nextradites its citizens under French legislation. \nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004, \npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently \namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the \nfollowing: \"Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of \nI The relevant chapter includes Articles 696- I to Article 696.47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, \nand thus includes Article 696.2. \nEFTA00016785\n\nWILLIAM JULIE \nAVOCAT A  LA COUR \nsubsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instruments as stated by the \naforementioned law of 10 March 1927: the legislative provisions on extradition are applicable \nonly in the silence or in the absence of international conventions.' \nIt follows from the provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure that the \nkey question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty \nbetween the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union \nand the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation. \nAs previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not preclude \nthe French government from extraditing a French national and must therefore be distinguished \nfrom a  number of other international agreements signed by France which contain a  clear \nprohibition to that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French \ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its own citizens to the USA. \nIt is noted that the letter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue. \n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case \nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine \nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French \nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2007. \nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, I  am not aware that this \ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the \nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has \nreferred to in its memorandum, I doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case: \nas mentioned by the 2007 letter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the \nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision \nrefusing extradition on August 22nd 2007, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the \nbeginning of August 2007). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision \nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could \nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed \non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process. \nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the \nFrench Conseil d'Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative matters, as for \nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a  decision from the \nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil \nd'Etat, 15 October1993, no. 142578). In the Peterson case, the American government did not \n2 Circulaire Mandat d'arret europeen et Extradition n° CRIM-04-2/CAB-I 1.03.2004 du I I mars 2004 \nEFTA00016786\n\nWILLIAM JULIE \nAVOCAT A LA COUR \nchallenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial \nreview of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure. \nSecondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the \noutcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts. \nThird, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their \naforementioned letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in \nits memorandum: \n\"Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in \npertinent pan that \"There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the \nextradition of a person who is a  national of the Requested State\". While this Article \ndoes not require the extradition of a  national to a requesting state, it also does not \nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such \nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in \nfavor of extradition\". \nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I \ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule \nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary power is not a legal rule. \nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these \nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of \nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an \nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable \nwaiver in the \nUSA. \nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations \nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would \nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and \nthe United States of America, which came into force on February Is', 2010, several years after \nthe Peterson case. Article 1 of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between \nContracting Parties, provides that: \"The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the \nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of \napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America \ngoverning extradition of offenders\". The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken \ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to \ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA. \nWilliam JULIE \nEFTA00016787",
