Do we have returns from that card \ncurrently, or is this an entirely new card request? \nNo problem either way, but I wanted to check since you said the closing date of the last statement was 12/18/19 \nso that made me think we might have some returns from that account already. Though looking at the returns we \nreceived from Amex previously, I don't see it. Please let us know? Thanks very much. \n Ori final Messa e \nFrom: \n(NY) (FBI) \nalME> \nSent: Monday.
