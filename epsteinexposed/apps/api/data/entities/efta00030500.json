Any downside? \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, June 26, 2020 10:40 AM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: FW: Requests \nAh, some clarity. Do you think we should produce the DOJ Ethics Handbook, attached? Foy asked for the BOP Employee \nCode of Conduct, which we now have and will be producing, and the (presumably BOP) Code of Ethics. \nFrom: \n<ckizzier@bop.gov>\nSent: Thursday, June 25, 2020 6:21 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: FW: Requests \nAll, \nI hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I \ncontinue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me \nknow if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. \nMany of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. \nThese issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I  tried to include all policies that \nreference those topics. \n1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? \nExecutive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will \naddress this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. \n2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive \nto? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and \nthis section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. \n3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? \nThis policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I  included the \npolicy because it directly correlated with other requests. \n4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive \nto? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you \nrequested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I  have requested an updated version that would have been used \nmore closely to the time of assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to \nprovide me whatever it is they used at that time. \n5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our \nrequests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request \nEFTA00030500\n\none from a  time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the \nInstitutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It \nis now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. \n6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this \nresponsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of \nquarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online \ntraining platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The \nofficial SHU training course is not something I  can send or save due to the nature of the course \nbeing automated by the training platform and not a hard file. \n7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the \nStandards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've \nattached the DO] Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let \nme know. \n8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these \nlogs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I  have worked at \nplaces that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. \nThe LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for \nreview purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. \n9. We were provided with a document called \"SHU Logs MW\" and a document called \"SHU Logs.\" Can we confirm \nwhat these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the \ndigital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time \nperiod. I  am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control \nCenter at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch \ncalls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a —  6p each day. \n10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as \nhaving been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly \ntraining requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. \n11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request \nincorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. \n12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I  am not aware of any such policy and \nhave struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I  will continue to search \nfor a policy that references cellmate assignments. \n13. In the second email, there is a document called \"Hot Lists\" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this \nresponsive to? The \"Hot List\" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires \nimmediate notification to Psychology. This is the only \"high risk\" list the BOP has and I  provided it \nin response to you.uest for \"All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings...\" \n14. In the second email, mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. \nDo you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? \n15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I  continue to work from home, I  have not \npersonally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I  previously mentioned, \nthose logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I  continue to follow up on this. \nWith regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are \ncurrently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming \nthey were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I  am currently \ntrying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs \nfor the period of assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking \ndown inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number \nof institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time \nthat are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with \nall of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I  have not confirmed that yet. \nSpecial Investigative Agent \nMCC New York \n150 Park Row \nNew York, NY 10007 \n>>> \n> 06125/20 12:35 PM >>> \nEFTA00030501\n\nCan you please address the questions/discrepancies noted below.
