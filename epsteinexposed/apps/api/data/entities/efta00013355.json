The summary, which is available on the Justice Department \nwebsite, provides the essential details about the findings of OPR's investigation \ninto the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's resolution of \nits 2006-2008 federal criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and its \ninteractions with victims during the investigation. \nWhile OPR did not find that Department attorneys engaged in professional \nmisconduct, OPR concluded that the victims were not treated with the \nforthrightness and sensitivity expected by the Department. OPR \nalso concluded \nthat former U.S. Attorney Acosta exercised poor judgment by deciding to resolve \nthe federal investigation through the non-prosecution agreement and when he \nfailed to make certain that the state of Florida intended to and would \nnotify \nvictims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea hearing. \nIn order to fully respect the rights and dignity of Jeffrey Epstein's many victims, \nthe Department first invited victims and their legal representatives to be briefed \nthis morning on the report's contents. The Privacy Act prohibits the Department \nfrom releasing the full report publicly, but permits the report to be disclosed upon \nrequest to a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the matter, and this \nhas been \ndone. \nWe salute the courage of survivors as they again are confronted with these \nhorrible crimes and their aftermath. The Department will thoroughly review the \nreport, which will inform our implementation of the Crime Victims Rights' Act \nand the Attorney General's Guidelines on Victim and Witness Assistance. \n### \nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.
