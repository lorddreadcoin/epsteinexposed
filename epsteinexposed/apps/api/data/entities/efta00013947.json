Dutko, Esq. \nBogenschutz & \nDutko \n600 S. Andrews Ave, Suite 500 \nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301-2802 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein-: AMENDED NOTIFICATION OF \nIDENTIFIED VICTIM \nDear Mr. Dutko: \nBy virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of \nFlorida asks that you provide the following amended notice to \nt, Some \nof the information contained in the July 20, 2008 letter to Ms. was \ninaccurate, so please \nadvise her of the following changes. \nAs you were previously advised, on June \n30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to \nas \"Epstein) entered a  plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony \nsolicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the \n15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXX.XMB and \n2008-cf-009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be \nfollowed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of Community \nControl 1, with conditions of community \nconfinement imposed by the Court. \nIn light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the \nUnited States has agreed to defer \nfederal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain \nconditions, \nincluding the following: \n1. An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an attorney \nrepresentative to represent the victims in connection with civil litigation between \nthe victims and Mr. Epstein. The \nSpecial Master selected Robert Josefsberg, Esq. \nof the firm Podhurst Orseck, P.A., a  highly-respected and \nexperienced attorney. \nMs. is not obligated to use Mr. \nJosefsberg as her civil attorney, but, as \nexplained in eater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg's \nservices will be provided at no \ncost \nto Ms. \n'ecause Mr. Epstein is obligated to pay the costs and fees of the \nattorne -representative. Also, Mr. Epstein and his attorneys can only contact Ms. \nis Mr. Josefsberg, assuming that she would like \nMr. Josefsberg to serve as \nher attorni \n2. If Ms. elects to file suit against Mr. Epstein pursuant to Title 18, United \nStates Code, Section \n2255, Mr. Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person \nand/or the subject matter, and Mr. Epstein waives his right to contest liability and \nalso waives his right to contest damagesantn \namount as agreed to between Ms. \nand Mr. Epstein, so long as Ms. \nelects to proceed exclusively under \n18 U.S.C. § \n2255, and she waives any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to \nstate, federal, or common law. Notwithstanding this waiver, Epstein's agreement \nEFTA00013947\n\nwith the United States, his waivers and failure to contest liability and such damages \nin any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any criminal or civil liability. \n3. As stated above, Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney \nrepresentative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, \nshall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested liti ation filed \nagainst him. Thus, if after consideration of potential settlements, Ms. and \nMr. Josefsberg elect to file a contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § \n2255 or she \nelects to pursue any other contested remedy, the obligation to \npay the costs of the \nattorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations \nto pay \nreasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in Section 2255 to bear \nthe costs of the attorney representative, shall cease. \nMr. Josefsberg will be conta tin ou within the next week to explain these terms and to \ndetermine if he may contact Ms. irectly. If you would like \nto contact Mr. Josefsberg \ndirectly, he can be reached at\nIf Ms. \nhas selected other counsel to represent her, or if she \ndoes so in the future, \nand she decides to pursue a claim \nagainst Jeffrey Epstein, his attorney, Jack Goldberger, asks that \nhe be contacted at Atterbury \nGoldberger and Weiss, 250 Australian Avenue South, Suite 1400, \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401. \nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make available to any designated \nvictim (and/or her attorney) a copy of the actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United \nStates, so long as the victim (and/or her attorney \nreviews, signs, and agrees to be bound by a \nProtective \nOrder entered by the Court. If Ms. \nwould like to review the Agreement, \nplease let me know, and I will forward a copy of the rotective Order for her signature. \nAs I  stated in my earlier notification, please understand that neither the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation can take part in or otherwise assist in civil \nlitigation, but we again thank you and your client for all of her assistance during the course of \nthis investigation. \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY \nBy: \nASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY \ncc: Robert \nJosefsberg, Esq. \nJack \nGoldberger, Esq. \nEFTA00013948",
