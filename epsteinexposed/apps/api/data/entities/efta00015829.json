I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things \ntomorrow: \n•  The older contains just one report, and I think that goes in the folder instead. \nPlease move it and delete his folder. Same thing for thfolder. \n• \nare the same person and the folders can be merged under the name \n• is the same person as \nmaterials and delete the folder? \n•  The stuff in the folder should actually go in the \nthe one for Pry once the stuff is moved over. \na potential testifying witness. Could you please move those \nolder, and you can delete \nEFTA00015829\n\n•  In the folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a \nnew, NTW folder for him? \n• could you please \nmove these to the not-a-witness folder you created? We'll deal with the contents later, but not in the context of \nthe NTW production. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00015830",
