The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. \nPrevious requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim \nthe camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the \ncorner room. \nI am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. \nThe previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. \nEFTA00025142\n\nAlso, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below. \nPlease promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries. \nThank you-\nBobbi \n<Screen \nShot 2021-10-25 at 7.10.13 PM.png> \n<Screen Shot \n2021-10-25 at 7.07.56 PM.png> \nPlease note my new office address and preferred email address: \nBOBBI C.
