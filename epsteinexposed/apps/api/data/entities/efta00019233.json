Do you have a few minutes to chat this afternoon or early next week? \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, January 9, 2020 4:55 PM \nTo: \n) < \n>; \nCc: \nSubject: FW: MCC New York (Procedural Review) \nHello Everyone, \nOur HQ staff was contacted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in association with the matters concerning the \nEpstein/MCC case, and informed that they would like to convene a Board of Inquiry that would review the operations at \nthe MCC NY. I have been asked to share this with the investigative and prosecution team for opinion and consideration. I \nrequested that the BOP provide us with some specific information and details about what this would include and we were \nprovided with the below information and attached Program Statement. Can you all please review this information and \nthen can one representative from the FBI and one representative from the U.S. Attorney's Office, SDNY, let us know your \nEFTA00019233\n\noffice's position regarding this matter? I have included SAC and ASAC of our Operations Branch I \n(OPS I) in this email as they deal directly with the BOP HQ. Thank you all. \nSpecial Agent in Charge \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOffice of the Inspector General \nNew York Field Office \nOne Battery Park Plaza, 29th Floor \nNew York, NY 10004 \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 8, 2020 11:44 AM \nTo: \nSubject: MCC New York \nHi • - \nThe BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations \ngenerally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, review \ncamera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a  misconduct investigation. Should the \nBoard come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent with normal \nmisconduct reporting requirements. \nWe are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise connected to \nthe criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if you have \nadditional questions or would like to discuss. Thanks in advance. \nU.S. Department of Justice \nFederal Bureau of Prisons \nOffice of Internal Affairs \n320 First Street, N.W., Room 600 \nWashington, \nD.C. 20534 \nEFTA00019234",
