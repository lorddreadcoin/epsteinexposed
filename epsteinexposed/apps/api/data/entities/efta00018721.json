See attached. I requested that the letter be translated on an expedited basis. I think we may be able to \nstrengthen the second highlighted sentence and cite to the last paragraph of MOJ's letter, but I'm awaiting the translation. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 08, 2021 8:09 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nThanks very much. Will send to now. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 08, 2021 7:20 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: RE: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nThanks , we had a couple of additional comments but this looks good. We'd like you guys to send to tonight, so \nI think it's fine to keep the caveat about OIA/highlighted language in there while she reviews. Thanks again. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 8, 2021 6:39 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nChiefs, \n>; \nAttached is an updated draft of the opposition for your review. Our OIA contact in the UK had no edits on the language in \nthe attached. As indicated in the attached, the OIA contact in France is still waiting on feedback from MOJ; if we don't get \nconfirmation, we will remove the highlighted language. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, March 07, 2021 10:04 PM \nTo: \nEFTA00018721\n\nCc: \nSubject: RE: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nSome combined comments and questions in track. I would like to see again at some point, and I think will want to \nsee as well. But hopefully this should permit you to get the relevant section to OIA in the morning. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, March 7, 2021 8:16 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition \nChiefs, \nHope you both had a nice weekend. Attached for your review is a draft of our opposition to the third bail application, also \nattached for your convenience. As noted in the draft, we are still waiting on feedback from OIA re France so that section \nis subject to change. We also plan to send the section on citizenship renunciation to OIA to make sure they review for \naccuracy (as we did with our last opposition). Given the time difference and our filing deadline of Tuesday, we are hoping \nto send this to them sometime tomorrow morning, but of course, happy to discuss. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nEFTA00018722",
