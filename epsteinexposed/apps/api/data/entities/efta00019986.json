He confirmed that Tartaglione can go to the roof for \nrecreation. SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said Tartaglione is usually \nsleeping, and once he eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when Tartaglione and \nEpstein were housed together, Epstein asked about rec. The officer told Epstein he would take him at 6:00 AM \nbefore his attorneys showed up. Tartaglione was in the cell during this conversation, and the officer told me \nmade a comment like \"I can take you up together\" to both of them. \nThe Facilities Manager told me they talked to Tartaglione. He had no complaints about his cell. He only \ncomplained that water leaked in his cell when people \"took long showers.\" Facilities ran the shower for awhile \nand didn't see the water leaking down to Tartaglione's cell, but if I  give Tartaglione the benefit of the doubt, he \nmay be correct that the water makes its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. \nEvening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave Tartaglione the three newspapers that arrived in the mail \nyesterday morning. \nI  think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else. \nThanks! \nStaff Attorney \nCLC \nNew York \nMetropolitan Correctional Center \nEFTA00019986\n\n8/20/2019 2:47  PM >>> \nand \nBruce Barket just filed the attached letter on ECF. Are you available for another call this afternoon, please? \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00019987",
