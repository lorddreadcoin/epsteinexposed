Could you please send us the following information: \n•  A list of all FOIA requests our office has received; \n•  For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and \n•  Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is. \nThat would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00018733",
