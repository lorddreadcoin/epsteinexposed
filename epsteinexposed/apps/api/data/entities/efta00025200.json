That spreadsheet does \nnot include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 \ndiscovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office \nduring the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range \nSDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. \nAs a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the \nphysical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Laura Menninger <Imenninger@hmflaw.com> \nSent: Tuesday, March 9, 2021 3:44 PM \nTo: \n) < \n>; \n(USANYS)<> \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliuca@hmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresseccom>; 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com> \nSubject: RE: US v.
