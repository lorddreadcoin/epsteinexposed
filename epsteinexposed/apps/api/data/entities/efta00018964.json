I'll be in the subway for the next half hour or \nso but then at my desk today. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \nDate: Au ust 10 2019 at 11:30:02 EDT \nTo: \nSubject: Re: Epstein update \nIt is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic \ninformation so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get \neither some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with \nsomeone? \nI  understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and \ngiven the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please \nadvise. \nThank you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43, wrote: \nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who \ncontinue to be \nseeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received.

Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written \nreport on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is \nextraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nEFTA00018964\n\nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 08:46 > wrote: \nPassed away.
