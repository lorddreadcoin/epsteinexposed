Let me know if you have any revisions before I send to the chiefs. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:02 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Letter regarding discovery attached. \nThanks for sending, M. I agree with this approach, though defer to if she's handling, and thanks in advance. On \nthe last point: I do think we have a firm view that they should not be filing our discovery materials in civil cases. I don't \ncare about the substance of these particular documents, but I think we agree that is an important aspect of the protective \norder to assert, both in this instance and in general, so this issue doesn't continue to crop up. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:37 AM \nTo: \n) \nCc: \nI  `:=> \nSubject: FW: Letter regarding discovery attached. \nI think is particularly swamped this week—can you please take the lead on whatever we're going to do with this \n(i.e., presumably whatever the chiefs decide)? My personal vote would be to tell them that the protective order explicitly \nprecludes the use of criminal grand jury materials in Maxwell's civil cases, and the materials are sealed because they \nrelate to an ongoing grand jury investigation and they should feel free to raise the issue with Nathan and we'll respond. \n(And I would think our response could basically be a copy-paste of the letter I wrote to Netburn.) We could also note in \nour response to Jeff and Laura, if we wanted to, that given their awareness of the materials, we assume they will retract \nthe obviously false claims about government malfeasance. \nAll that said, I also wouldn't object if they just want to allow them to file these materials under seal; I don't think it \nmatters hugely. If we could have resolved (et al) by now, none of this would be an issue. \nthanks, \nFrom: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliuca@hmflaw.com>\nSent: Sunday, August 09, 2020 18:56 \nTo: \n> \nCc: Laura Menninger <ImenningDVhmflaw.com>.
