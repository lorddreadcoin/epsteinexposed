Attached please find the accompanying cover letter, \nwhich I will hand deliver with the laptop. I am available to make this delivery tomorrow. Would you \nplease let me know what time I should arrive with the laptop? \nMy understanding from is that I should bring the laptop to the East Building, located on \n29th Street near 3rd Avenue and that I should go to the front lobby and ask for who will then \ncome and retrieve the laptop. Please let me know if that is correct, or if I should take any different steps. \nAs always, I can be reached on my cellphone at with any questions or concerns. \nThank you, \n>; \n>; \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00029274",
