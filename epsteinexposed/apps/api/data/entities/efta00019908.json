In your further discussions with Ms. in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general \nEFTA00019908\n\nnature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns \nabout additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I \nbelieve any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to \nfurther research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely. \nPlease let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming \nweeks about productive next steps. \nthank you, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019909",
