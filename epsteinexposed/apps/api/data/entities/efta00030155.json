Preska allowed Dershowitz's motion to be reinstated and said he could file a \n28-page memo on his request. \nThe order comes a week after Judge Preska said she was removing the motion because Dershowitz didn't request a \npremotion conference before the filing in violation of a court rule. \nDershowitz's \naccuser \nhas alleged that convicted billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein \"lent her out for \nsex\" to Dershowitz and that Dershowitz played a  role as Epstein's attorney and friend in a human trafficking  scheme \nduring the late 1990s and early 2000s involving dozens of underage girls. \nIn a July 7 motion, Dershowitz argued that Boies Schiller shouldn't be allowed to continue to represent necause \nthe firm has \"severe\" conflicts in the case. \nThose stem from an offer made in 2015 by Boies Schiller partner Carlos Sires to represent Dershowitz after Giuffre alleged \nEFTA00030155\n\nin a  separate Crime Victims Rights Act suit focused on Epstein's deal with prosecutors that she had sex with Dershowitz \nand others. \nDershowitz said in his motion he didn't learn Boies Schiller was representing his accuser in the current case until after he \nshared with Sires a \"highly confidential\" memo spelling out his legal strategy in the case. The next day, Sires informed \nDershowitz that a client conflict was going to prevent him from representing Dershowitz. \nLast week, Boies Schiller submitted a  letter to the court stating that Dershowitz hadn't complied with the premotion \nconference rule; Judge Preska agreed and ordered his filing \"marked off the calendar.\" \n\"Professor Dershowitz is gratified that the court will consider the motion on its merits,\" said Dershowitz counsel Arthur L. \nAidala and Imran H. Ansari in a statement Tuesday. \nGiuffre counsel Joshua Schiller of Boies Schiller submitted a letter to Judge Preska on Monday urging her to deny the \ndisqualification request without further briefing. \nDershowitz filed the \"tactical\" motion months into the suit despite having known for some five years that the firm \nrepresents =Schiller said. Moreover, Dershowitz's brief contact with Sires never resulted in the formation of an \nattorney-client relationship. \n\"Even though he knew that BSF's conflict check had not been completed, Dershowitz copied Mr. Sires into a group e-mail \nattaching a memorandum, which Dershowitz now claims was confidential,\" Schiller wrote, adding that the memo was \naddressed to Dershowitz's \"friends\" and contained no confidential information. \n\"This is an attempt to manufacture a conflict and delay the case and prevent our client from working with the counsel \nshe's worked with for five years,\" Schiller told Law360. \nDershowitz's ties to the Epstein scandal were back in the news after a February ruling by U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. \nMarra, who found current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta had been among several prosecutors who mishandled a decade-\nold sex crime case against Epstein when they signed a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without notifying his \nvictims. \nGiuffre is represented by Joshua Schiller and Sigrid McCawley of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. \nDershowitz is represented by Imran H. Ansari and Arthur L. Aidala of Aidala Bertuna & Kamins PC. \nThe case is,.
