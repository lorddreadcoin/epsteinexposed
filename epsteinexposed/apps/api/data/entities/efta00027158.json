Her counsel have asked whether she should dial into the public \naccess line, or whether the Court will provide a separate access line for victims. \n•  Victim-2's attorneys, David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, plan to attend the conference in person. \nRespectfully, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00027158",
