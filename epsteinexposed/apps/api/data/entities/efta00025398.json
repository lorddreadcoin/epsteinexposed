We do not believe \nthat asking victims about their past contacts with the USAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA in or about 2005-2008 would present any \nissues for our office, we would just respectfully ask that any such discussions avoid addressing the substance of the \nunderlying criminal scheme (including the victims' personal experiences and interactions with Epstein or his associates). \nAnd if those topics unavoidably arise despite not having been raised by OPR, we'd ask that you please let us know so we \ncan incorporate any such witness statements as 3500 material as appropriate and required. But please let us know if that \nposes any issues on your end. \nthanks again, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: \n(OPR)<\n> \nSent: Monday, April 06, 2020 15:32 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter (following up on our recent conversation) \nThank you, M. This is sufficient; no need for you to do anything further. \nI want to assure you that in reaching out to and possibly interviewing the victims regarding their past contacts with the \nUSAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA, OPR wishes to in no way interfere with anything your office may be doing currently or \nanticipates doing in the future. Please confirm that our doing so does not present any issues for your office. If you have \nany concerns in that regard, please let me know so we can discuss the matter. I hope I might hear back from you by \nmidday Wednesday if possible. \nBest regards, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, April 03, 2020 7:48 PM \nTo: (OPR) \nCc: \nsc›; \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter (following up on our recent \nconversation) \nefl \nEFTA00025398\n\nThanks for following up, and as discussed we are able to advise OPR regarding the individuals on your list whom we \nunderstand to be represented by counsel. I'm happy to speak with you via phone at your convenience, but in the first \ninstance, because the overwhelming majority of the individuals on your list are represented by counsel, attached is a \nspreadsheet with the relevant information. The spreadsheet represents our best and current understanding—it is of \ncourse possible that individuals have changed their counsel very recently, but this should hopefully at least get you \nstarted. \nAs reflected in the spreadsheet, of the 32 individuals you listed, 22 are represented by Brad Edwards, of Edwards Pottinger \nLLC; two are represented by Jack Scarola, of Searcy Law; one is represented by Sigrid McCawley, of Boies Schiller; one is \nrepresented by Rita Glavin, of Seward & Kissel LLP, and one is represented by Gloria Allred, of Allred, Maroko & Goldberg. \nOf the remaining five, four we have been unable to connect with (at least at the AUSA level), and one we believe is \ndeceased. The contact information for the attorneys is the following: \nBrad Edwards \nJack Scarola \nSigrid McCawley \nRita Glavin \nGloria Allred \nPlease let me know if it would be helpful to chat, and thanks as always. \nbest, \nFrom: (OPR) < \nSent: Thursday, April 02, 2020 14:04 \nTo: \nSubject: OPR Matter (following up on our recent conversation) \nAUSP \nUSAO-SDNY \nAs you and I have briefly discussed OPR wishes to conduct brief interviews, on very limited and historical matters, with a \nnumber of individuals who may be involved in matters you have under investigation, who are listed below. You offered to \nadvise us which of the individuals you know to be currently represented by counsel, and who those counsel are. For \nefficiency's sake, I would like to schedule a phone call with you for that purpose. Please let me know when you might be \navailable. \nAs are so many of us, I'm teleworking, but available to speak at pretty much any time of the workday. \nWith regards, \nCounsel \nOffice of Professional Responsibility \nU.S. Department of Justice — Suite 3266 \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW \nWashington DC 20530 \nEFTA00025399\n\nEFTA00025400",
