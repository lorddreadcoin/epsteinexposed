Here's what you need to know to end your day. \n•  The retail mood turned sour on dreary earnings. \n•  People listening in on Trump's Ukraine call said things weren't right. \n•  Want a raise? Move to Texas. \nHome Depot and Kohl's posted disappointing results, raising doubts \nabout whether American consumers can keep up the spending as the \nholiday season approaches. \n•  Home Depot's weak performance—comp sales grew 3.6% last \nquarter versus the 4.6% consensus—was all the more surprising \nsince the company had told investors that the second half of the year \nwould be better. Same-store sales have now trailed projections for \nthree straight quarters \n•  At Kohl's, that metric increased 0.4% in the third quarter, half of \nwhat analysts expected. The retailer now says profit ex-items will be \n$4.75 to $4.95—with the new top of the range 50 cents below the \nprevious outlook \n•  Urban Outfitters reported same-store sales of 3%, which topped \nthe Consensus Metrix estimate but was down from 8% a year ago. \nComparable sales at its chains—Urban Outfitters, Free People and \nAnthropologie—all missed. Shares fell more than 10% in late trading. \n•  And then there was Macy's, which doesn't report until Thursday. It \nfell 11% after confirming some customers were exposed to a data \nhack while shopping on its website last month. \n•  TJX had a better day. Shares rose on what MKM's Roxanne Meyer \ncalled a \"high quality\" quarter. She believes the T.J. Maxx and \nHomeGoods owner will continue to benefit from exceptional \nproducts, effective marketing and new customer growth. \nEFTA00032804\n\n•  Stocks ended the day mixed as investors weighed the retail \ndata against new developments in the trade saga. \nThe second week of public impeachment hearings began with two \nwitnesses saying that Trump's Ukraine call was inappropriate. \n•  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman said the July 25 call \nbetween Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr \nZelenskiy, which he listened in on, so alarmed him that he reported it \nto the White House counsel. \"It was inappropriate, it was improper \nfor the president to request, to demand an investigation into \na political opponent,\" he said. \n•  Jennifer Williams, a State Department employee assigned to VP \nMike Pence's office who also listened in, said the call was outside \nthe bounds of typical presidential interactions since \"it involved \ndiscussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.\" \n•  Under questioning from Republican staff lawyer Steve Castor, \nVindman said he was offered the job as Ukraine's defense minister \nwhile on an official trip to that country. Vindman, an immigrant from \nUkraine, called the offer \"comical,\" and said he reported it to his \nsuperiors. Democrat Jim Himes accused Republicans of seeking to \nquestion Vindman's loyalty to the U.S. by raising the matter. \n•  There sure are a lot of ribbons and badges on Lieutenant Colonel \nVindman's chest. Here's what they mean \n•  The afternoon session is underway, with testimony from Kurt \nVolker, former special envoy to Ukraine, and Timothy Morrison, NSC \nsenior director for Europe and Russia. \n•  Volker said that he wasn't aware of and didn't knowingly take part \nin any effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rival, Joe \nBiden. Follow along with our \nWhat Else is Happening \nImpeachment Update \nThe U.S.-China trade deal that fell apart six months ago has become the \nbenchmark to decide how much tariffs should be reduced in the initial \nphase of an agreement, people familiar said. The White House is debating \nthe precise rollback, ranging from 35% to 60%. Beijing is demanding that \nall levies imposed after May be removed immediately and those before \nEFTA00032805\n\nthen be lifted gradually. Pence said that it would be \"very hard\" to sign a \ndeal if protests in Hong Kong are met with violence. \nSpeaking of which, the Senate is expected to pass bipartisan legislation \nto support Hong Kong's protesters by unanimous consent later today. If it \npasses, the bill would need to be reconciled with a slightly different House \nversion before going to Trump for his signature, who's yet to indicate \nwhether he will sign. \nAmerica's big banks are getting further relief from capital demands as \nregulators set up a new approach for measuring risk in derivatives trades. \nThe revision will result in banks being considered to have about 9% less \nexposure in their derivatives contracts, according to regulators' estimates. \nIt's the latest of a series of rollbacks coordinated by Trump appointees. \nOpinion \nThe scaling back of Saudi Aramco's IPO—despite nearly every major \ninvestment bank being involved— raises awkward questions about the \neffectiveness of mammoth syndicates of advisers and bookrunners, Chris \nHughes writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Diluted accountability makes it \nunlikely that anyone will deliver an unpopular message, like that the deal \nisn't worth $2 trillion. And many, many banks may not add much in terms of \nselling shares given that there's probably huge overlap between \ntheir investment fund clients. More appears to be less \nThe merger party may be coming to an end, Bloomberg Opinion's Joe \nNocera writes. One of the FTC's two Democratic commissioners, Rohit \nChopra, has written that there's some evidence drug mergers \"have \n, creating harms that are immeasurable for those choked off innovation \nwaiting for a cure.\" He also believes that the FTC can block mergers on \nantitrust grounds. Since some senators who are also presidential \ncandidates have called for greater M&A scrutiny, it's a pretty good bet that \na new administration will view takeovers in a different light. \nSponsored Content by SmartAssetTM \nPeople Who \nRetire Comfortably Avoid These 7 Financial Advisor \nMistakes \nEFTA00032806\n\nWorking with a financial advisor is a crucial component of any \nretirement plan, but most people make these simple mistakes \nwhen hiring one. These are 7 common but costly mistakes happy \nretirees avoid. \nBusinessweek Today \nWarby Parker wants to be the Warby Parker of contact lenses. The \nretailer is introducing Scout, a line of daily contacts. It's the first time the \ncompany has expanded beyond eyeglasses since its founding almost a \ndecade ago. At $440 for a year's supply, they'll be slightly cheaper than \nmany daily lenses but will be sold with what Warby says will be a much \nimproved ordering process. \nThe Haredim have long been isolated from secular Israeli society. \nPrograms like the Pardes Project seek to better integrate these ultra-\nOrthodox scholars into the economy. That's caught the attention of \nMossad, the nation's intelligence agency, which wants to attract more \nHaredim in a tight labor market. \"These people are geniuses, and they \nhave no opportunities,\" says Pardes founder Moshe Kahan. \nUltra-Orthodox men fill out registration sheets at an employment center in \nJerusalem. Photographer Corina Kern/Laif/Redux \nWhat Everybody's Talking About \nTwo guards at a Manhattan jail who were supposed to keep watch on \nfinancier Jeffrey Epstein when he killed himself were charged with six \ncounts of falsifying documents and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. The \nguards never checked on Epstein after 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 9 until he was \ndiscovered the next morning, according to the indictment. Instead, they \nsearched the internet for furniture and motorcycle sales and sports news, \nprosecutors alleged, and \"appeared to have been asleep\" for two hours. \nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss just made their first-ever acquisition, and \nthe duo behind the company they bought couldn't be more similar. Duncan \nand Griffin Cock Foster are also identical twins. Their company, Nifty \nEFTA00032807\n\nGateway, lets users buy crypto collectibles with a credit card instead of \ndigital currency. Yes, we're confused about it, too. \nBy the Way \nIf you want a fat salary, move to Midland, Texas. According to Commerce \nDepartment data, the oil boom city's per capita personal income \nwas $122,247 last year, higher than San Jose, San Francisco, Boston or \nNew York. Not surprisingly, the riches drew people: The city led all metro \nareas in 2018 population growth with a 4.4% gain. But—fair warning—the \ngood times may not last. A recent drop in local energy rigs has coincided \nwith slower job growth, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas data shows. \nFOLLOW-US \nice.   lip\n-SEND-TEM-FRIEND \nli p \nYpheirernOtanw Wetharm cribed to Bloomberg's The Bloomberg Close \n- \nmericas wsletter. \nUnsubscribe I Bloomberg.com I Contact Us \nBloomberg L.P. 731 Lexington, New York, NY, 10022 \nEFTA00032808",
