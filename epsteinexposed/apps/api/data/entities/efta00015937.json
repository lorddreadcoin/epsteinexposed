P. 6(e) \nVIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \nU.S. Attorney's \nOffice \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: July 11, 2019 Subpoena to Deutsche Bank \nDea \nOn behalf of our client, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch and its affiliates (\"Deutsche \nBank\" or the \"Bank\"), we write in further response to the grand jury subpoena dated July 11, 2019 \n(the \"Subpoena\"). This letter and the enclosed document production represent the eleventh \nsubmission in our client's rolling response to the Subpoena. \nEnclosed with this letter is an encrypted file labeled DB-SDNY-PROD011 containing \ndocuments responsive to items I, 4, 7, 9, 12, 19, 20, and 27 of the Subpoena. As described in the \nenclosed production index, labeled Appendix A,  today's production contains the following \ncategories of documents responsive to the Subpoena: \n• DB-SDNY-0028783 to 0031309: Bank records and electronic \ncommunications related to the following topics: \no The Bank's decision to onboard the Epstein Relationship \n(designated as \"Onboarding\" in Appendix A); \no In-person meetings between Bank personnel, Jeffrey Epstein, and/or \nhis associates (designated as \"Meetings\" in Appendix A); \no The transfer of Jeffrey Epstein's assets from JP Morgan to Deutsche \nBank from 2013 through 2014 (designated as \"Transfer\" in \nAppendix A); \nEFTA00015937\n\nNovember 19, 2019 \nPage 2 \no The Bank's policies and procedures related to its Americas \nReputational Risk Committee from 2013 to 2018 (designated as \n\"ARRC\" in Appendix A); \no Certain revenue-sharing accounts opened by the Bank in connection \nwith the Epstein relationship (designated as \"Revenue Sharing \nAccounts\" in Appendix A). \n• DB-SDNY-0031310 to 0031643: Bank records related to wire transfers \nfrom Jeffrey E stein's charitable entity, Gratitude America, Ltd., to the \nFoundation (designated as `4\"  in \nAppendix A). \n• DB-SDNY-0031644 to 0033038: Bank records, including emails, related \nto lar e, routine cash withdrawals made b Jeffrey Epstein's attorney, \n,   and accountant (designated as \"Cash \nTransactions\" in Appendix A). \n• DB-SDNY-0033039 to 0033067: Bank records, including emails, related \nto certain large wire transfers involvin Jeffrey Epstein's U.S. Virgin \nIslands-based attorney, (designated as \"=MI\" in \nAppendix A). \n• DB-SDNY-0033068 to 0033069: A Se tember 2013 email from .Tre \na\nn's accountant, \n, \nto assistant, \nattaching a list of Epstein's JP Morgan accounts (designated as \"JPM \nAccounts\" in Appendix A). \n• DB-SDNY-0033070 to 0037559: Check images written from over twenty \nEpstein-affiliated accounts (designated as \"Checks\" in Appendix A). \nToday's production also encloses as Appendix B  a set of five supplemental exhibits that \nwe have prepared in response to questions raised in our prior discussions. The supplemental \nexhibits relate to the following issues: \n• Wire Transfers Related to Epstein Investments: Supplemental Exhibit \nA identifies wire transfers to third party bank accounts that appear to relate \nto investments in hedge funds and other private investment vehicles. \nEFTA00015938\n\nNovember 19, 2019 \nPage 3 \n• List of Payees of LSJE, LLC Account: Supplemental Exhibit B provides \nbackground information on the recipients of payments from an Epstein-\ncontrolled account, LSJE, LLC. KYC records indicate that Epstein planned \nto use the LSJE account as a \"[c]hecking account for the daily expenses \nassociated with running one of Jeffrey Epstein's private homes.\" KYC \nrecords do not specify which private home. The transactions reflected in \nExhibit B suggest that LSJE was used, at least in part, to manage Epstein's \nPalm Beach estate. \n• Butterfly Trust Account Transactions: Supplemental Exhibit C \nidentifies all incoming and outgoing transactions involving the Butterfly \nTrust money market account. \n• Timeline of Active/Capitalized Accounts: Supplemental Exhibit D \nprovides a  timeline of the openings and closings of Epstein's capitalized \nWealth Management accounts. \n• Payments to Certain Beneficiaries of the 2013 Butterfly \nTrust: Supplemental Exhibit E identifies payments to or on behalf of \ncertain beneficiaries of the 2013 Butterfly Trust, as well as their family \nmembers. The Bank did not open an account for this entity, but received \ntrust documents in the course of its due diligence on a separate Epstein-\nsettled trust, \"The 2017 Caterpillar Trust.\" The Bank previously briefed the \nSDNY on payments to the majority of the beneficiaries of the 2013 \nButterfl Trust, with the exce tions being \n, an Supplemental Exhibit E  contains \nthis additional information. \nThe decryption password for the production will be provided by separate email. As we \nhave discussed, we continue to collect relevant information related to the Subpoena, and expect to \nmake additional productions shortly. \nBecause we are producing these materials pursuant to a  grand jury subpoena, it  is our \nunderstanding that this production will be treated as confidential consistent with Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure 6(e).
