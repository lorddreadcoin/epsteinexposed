NATHAN, District Judge: \nThe Court has received an exchange of letters that pertain to an incident that took place \non April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258, 259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. \nMaxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by \nproviding Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. \nMaxwell's lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against \nMDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates \nno views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either \nside's allegations. This Court's obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the \ndefendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential attorney-\nclient communications, and prepare for trial. \nMindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After \nreceiving the defense's first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause \nwhy the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in \npart defense counsel's original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain \nquestions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to ensure the \nconfidentiality of Ms. Maxwell's lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense \nEFTA00031685\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 265 Filed 05/03/21 Page 2 of 3 \ncounsel's current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of \nthe in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of \ndefense counsel's preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel \nare entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be \nprovided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this \nCourt, that application is denied. \nThe Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity \nto meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances \nand consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated \nincident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal \ncounsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court's conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and \nher lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize \nthe importance of this going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. \nIn furtherance of this, counsel for the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal \ncounsel for MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-\nclient communications as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel \nshall promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to \nresolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties \nmay write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific \napplication being made. \nSO ORDERED. \nEFTA00031686\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 265 Filed 05/03/21 Page 3 of 3 \nDated: May 3, 2021 \nNew York, New York \nALISON J.
