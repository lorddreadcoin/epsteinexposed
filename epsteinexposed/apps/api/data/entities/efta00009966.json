I despise anyone who hurts children but whatever \nwas going to happen to him, I was not going to be a part of it,\" Tartglione, 51, wrote from an 8-by-10-foot cell he \ncalled The Box. \n\"The prison told Epstein they were putting him in a cell with me because they knew I would neither hurt nor \nextort him. The staff here at MCC had hundreds of inmates to choose from yet I was their first choice,\" \nTartglione wrote. \nEpstein's first attempted suicide on July 23 in the cell he shared with Tartaglione. Sources previously told The \nNews that Tartaglione believed he may have saved Epstein's life by quickly alerting jail staff to the attempted \nhanging. \n[More New York] State comptroller's annual MTA finance review warns of possible layoffs, growing budget \ngaps » \nEpstein, 66, was moved to suicide watch, separating him from Tartaglione. Sources said at the time that \ninvestigators were trying to determine whether Tartaglione had assaulted Epstein. \nEFTA00009966\n\nThe sex offender was subsequently taken off of suicide watch and hanged himself on Aug. 10 in a cell he \noccupied alone. He was awaiting trial on charges that carried a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. \n\"At or around the time of his death we did not see a despairing or despondent person,\" Epstein's attorney Reid \nWeingarten said at a recent hearing for the financier's victims. \nThe probe of how the pent with powerful friends managed to kill himself includes an examination of the first \nattempt, prosecutors have said in court. Tartaglione's attorney Bruce Barket said he has not been interviewed by \ninvestigators since Epstein's death. \n\"(Tartaglione) has not been questioned by any law enforcement official since July 23,\" Barket said. \n\"I can't imagine how they can claim a complete investigation without speaking to the person who was in the cell \nin that first event.\" \nA spokesman for the Southern District of New York declined comment. \nAttorney General William Barr said \"irregularities\" have been uncovered at the nightmarish lockup. The jail staff \non duty at the time of Epstein's hanging were reportedly exhausted from working multiple overtime shifts and \nfailed to follow protocol. The MCC is also coping with longstanding staff shortages. \n\"I still have some faith in the justice system,\" Tartaglione wrote. \"Every person in this country has the right to be \npresumed innocent until proven guilty. To anyone who reads this I only ask for that presumption because I \nhaven't felt it yet in the past 33 months.\" \nTartaglione, who has long complained about conditions at MCC, is seeking to be transferred to another federal \nlockup due to threats he says were made by jail staff after Epstein's suicide. \n\"It just doesn't seem appropriate that he be housed and guarded by the very people who are under investigation \ngiven his proximity to the investigation,\" Barket said at a recent hearing. \n\"My client shouldn't have to fear for his life.\" \n[More New York] Man found wrapped in a carpet was shot before being tossed outside Harlem Starbucks: cops » \nThe attorney said he did not know his client had sent the letter until after it was in the mail. \"It's a product of the \nfrustration at the entire situation,\" Barket said. \nThe musclebound ex-cop is charged with killing Martin Luna, 41, Hector Santiago, 32, Miguel Luna, 25, and \nHector Gutierrez, 43, in April 2016, as well as conspiring to distribute over five kilos of cocaine. Prosecutors say \ntwo of the victims had ties to a Mexican drug cartel. \nThe four men's bodies were found buried on Tartaglione's sprawling animal rescue farm in Otisville, Orange \nCounty. Tartaglione has been locked up since December 2016 and still does not have a trial date. \nEFTA00009967",
