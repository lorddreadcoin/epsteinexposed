Would you like those files tomorrow, as separate from the \nvideo transfers? Or all at once (both audio/video) next week? \nAs a follow up to the video lengths, most of the VHS tapes were recorded at slow speed or \"extended play\". \nThis means the length of each tape is 6-hrs (verses 2-hours at normal speed). \nWe spoke about preserving the entire tape. Just letting you know in advance. Of course, the estimate will \nreflect these extended times. \nOn Thu, Aug 8, 2019 at 8:17 PM \nYes. I am in at 8:10. \nSent from my iPad \nOn \nAug 8, 2019, at 8:16 PM, \nAre you available to talk tomorrow morning sometime? \nA few details I want to speak with you about. \nThanks. \nOn \nFri, Jul 26, 2019 at 12:05 PM \n> wrote: \n> wrote: \n> wrote: \nThanks \nOn Fri, Jul 26, 2019 at 11:45 AM \nWhat address? \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, July 26, 2019 8:28 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: FW: RE: vendor processes for Epstein case \nGood \nmorning M. \nYes, I can definitely help. \nWhat is the time frame for this? \nOn Fri, Jul 26, 2019 at 8:11 AM \n) < \nwrote: \n>  wrote: \nIn an obvious high profile case, we have VHS tapes and cassettes.
