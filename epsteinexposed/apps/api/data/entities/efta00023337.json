    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nSubject: US v. Epstein \nDate: Thu, 05 Mar 2020 19:00:52 +0000 \nHello-\nThe new data set you gave to me from the FBI has some problems and I was wondering if we can get the FBI to fix some of \nthese issues. Here are the problems: \n1. The data they sent to us has no way to put any e-mails or attachments together so if we were processing the data \nwe have no way to link anything together. \n2. The load file has no link to the native file which means that when we load the data to the database we have no \nway to have the native files show up in the database \n3. The control numbers in the load file do not match those of the native files. Which means we have two sets of \nnumbers and no way to match up anything. \nIf we can get the FBI to either send us the data again with these corrections applied that would be great. Please let me \nknow if there are any questions. \nThank you. \nEFTA00023337",
