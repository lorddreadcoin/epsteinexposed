    "text": "\n\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP \nNovember 8, 2021 \nBY EMAIL. \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Counsel: \nPursuant to the Court's Order dated June 2, 2021 (Dkt. 297), we write to provide the \ngovernment with the defense's disclosures under Rule 16(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure. \nAs the government is aware, the defense is under no obligation to present a defense case \nand whether we will do so remains subject to the developments at trial. Nevertheless, in \naccordance with the Court's order, we provide below a preliminary list of documents that the \ndefense may use in its case-in-chief, should we decide to present a defense case. \nWe note that Rule 16(b)(1)(A) requires disclosure only of documents and other items that \nare \"within the defendant's possession, custody, or control; and ... [that] the defendant intends to \nuse ... in the defendant's case-in-chief at trial.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). \nRule 16(b)(1)(A) does not require the defense to disclose, for example, potential impeachment \nevidence or documents that the defense may use to refresh a witness's recollection during the \ngovernment's case-in-chief. See United States v. Medearis, 380 F.3d 1049, 1057 (8th Cir. 2004) \n(Rule 16(b)(1)(A) does not require disclosure of impeachment evidence); United States v. Moore, \n208 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Haffield, No. 06 Cr. 550 (JS), 2009 WL \n10673619, at *1-2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2009) (same) (citing Medearis and Moore); see also United \nStates v.  Gray-Bwriss, 791 F.3d 50, 57-58 & n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (using \ndocuments to refresh \nrecollection of government's witnesses not covered by Rule 16); United States v. King, 703 F.2d \n119, 126 n.6 (5 Cir.1983) (noting that \"even though the documents were excluded from \nevidence\" because of defendant's failure to make a Rule 16 disclosure, \"[d]efense counsel was \nallowed to use the documents to refresh the recollection of witnesses\"). \nEFTA00028274\n\nNovember 8, 2021 \nPage 2 \nWe also note the following: First, the defense continues to investigate and prepare its case \nfor trial, which is still three weeks away. The defense has not made final determinations about \nwhich documents it may use in the defense case-in-chief, should we decide to present one. \nIndeed, those decisions will depend heavily on developments at trial. Second, the defense may \nreceive documents from Rule 17 subpoenas or other document requests which the defense may \nwant to use in any case-in-chief. Third, the government is still producing Rule 16 discovery, 3500 \nmaterial, and Giglio material, which may require additional investigation and may, in turn, yield \nadditional documents that the defense may wish to use in any case-in-chief. \nTo that end, the defense reserves its right to supplement these disclosures. The defense \nfurther recognizes that its disclosure obligations under Rule 16 are ongoing, and we will produce \nany additional Rule 16 materials to the government as we identify them. See Fed. R. Crim. P. \n16(c). \nDefense Rule 16 Disclosure \nPursuant to Rule 16(b)(1)(A), below is the preliminary list of the documents that the \ndefense may use should it elect to present a case-in-chief. We have attached copies of the \ndocuments listed below if they were not provided to the defense by the government in discovery. \nOtherwise, we provide the Bates numbers for the produced documents. Because we have already \nprovided the government with the defense expert notice, which referenced articles, reports, and \nother materials they relied upon to prepare their testimony, we have not repeated that information \nhere. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(I)(B) & (b)(1)(C). \nI. AT&T phone records \nSDNY GM 00514773-00514915 \nCertification — attached as Exhibit A \n2.
