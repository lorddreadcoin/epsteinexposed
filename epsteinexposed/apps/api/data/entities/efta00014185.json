    "text": "\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 34 Entered on FLSD Docket 08705:2008 Page 1 of 2 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nNO. 08-80119-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON \nJANE DOE NO. 2, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nDefendant. \nORDER DENYING MOTION TO SEAL \nTHIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to File \nUnder Seal, filed July 28, 2008. Defendant seeks to file his reply to his Motion to Stay under \nseal.' The Court has carefully considered the motion and the record and is otherwise fully \nadvised in the premises. \nAs the Court has previously explained to the parties, the Local Rules for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida state that \"proceedings in the United States District Court are public and Court \nfilings are matters of public record.\" S.D. Fla. L.R. 5.4(A). It is well settled that the media and \nthe public in general possess a common-law right to inspect and copy judicial records. See Nixon \nv. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978). \"The right to inspect and copy \nrecords is not absolute, however. As with other forms of access, it may interfere with the \nadministration of justice and hence may have to be curtailed.\" Newman v.  Graddick, 696 F.2d \n'The parties are reminded that all documents filed conventionally (including those filed \nunder seal) must be filed with the Clerk's Office in West Palm Beach, Florida. \n1 \nEFTA00014185\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 34 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/05/2008 Page 2 of 2 \n796, 803 (11th Cir.1983). This right of access creates a presumption in favor of openness of court \nrecords, which \"must be balanced against any competing interest advanced.\" United States v. \nNoriega, 752 F. Supp. 1037, 1040 (S.D. Fla.1990). For example, courts may look to see whether \nthe records sought are for illegitimate purposes. Newman, 696 F.2d at 803. Likewise, the Court \nmay consider whether \"the press has already been permitted substantial access to the contents of \nthe records.\" Id. \nIn his motion to seal, Defendant states that he seeks to file this document under seal \"to \ncomply with the confidentiality clause\" in the agreement between Defendant and the U.S. \nAttorney cited in his brief. (Def. Mot. 2.) The Court is familiar with the U.S. Attorney's \nobjections to unsealing any part of the agreement, see In re: Jane Doe, No. 08-80736-CIV (S.D. \nFla. July 11, 2008). However, as the Court has previously held, the U.S. Attorney's objections \ndo not outweigh the public interest in having access to court records. Further, the details of the \nagreement contained in Defendant's Reply brief have, in large part, already been unsealed and \nreleased to the public. The Court finds no justification to keep these documents under seal. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendant's Motion to File \nUnder Seal is DENIED. The Clerk shall UNSEAL docket entries 29 and 30 and make them \navailable for public inspection through CM/ECF at the earliest possible time. \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, \nFlorida, this 4ih  day of August, 2008. \nKENNETH A. MARRA \nUnited States District Judge \nCopies furnished to: all counsel of record \n2 \nEFTA00014186",
