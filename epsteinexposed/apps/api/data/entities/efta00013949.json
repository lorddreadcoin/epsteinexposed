Australian Ave, Ste 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nFacsimile: (561) 820-8777 \nAugust 20, 2008 \nDELIVERY BY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nJay P. Lefkowitz, Esq. \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nCitigroup Center \n153 East \n53rd Street \nNew York, New York 10022-4675 \nRoy Black, Esq. \nBlack Srebnick Kornspan & Stumpf P.A. \n201 S. Biscayne Blvd, Suite 1300 \nMiami, FL 33131 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Jay and Roy: \nThank you for your response to my earlier letter. The U.S. Attorney's Office \nshares in \nyour desire to implement all of the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. As you are aware, \nthe jointly-approved Special Master, Judge Davis, has already selected an attorney representative, \nRobert Josefsberg, who was accepted by both \nparties. The Office has conferred with Mr. \nJosefsberg, who has agreed to continue in that role. In October 2007, Mr. Josefsberg expended \ntime, effort, and funds in preparing to serve as the attorney representative, and he will need a \nwritten confirmation from you that his future fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with \nthe terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. Please provide me with a copy of that \ncorrespondence \nfor my file. \nWith that matter settled, I believe that the requirement for a joint written submission to the \nSpecial Master has been extinguished. Nonetheless, I have no objection to attempting to create a \njoint statement to assist Mr. Josefsberg in serving his duties. Regarding your suggestion that we \nask Judge Davis to \"offer the final word on how certain clauses should be \ninterpreted and \nsatisfied,\" I  believe that the Agreement speaks for itself and any ambiguities that you perceive \nwill be resolved with litigation with the intended third-party beneficiaries, i.e. , the listed victims. \nIn light of the ongoing litigation between the United States and two of the victims, I  am \nconcerned that \nefforts to modify or even interpret the Agreement will require consultation with \nall of the victims, which will be unwieldy and extremely time consuming. \nAs to your other points, I am happy to revert to the shorter list that was prepared as of the \nsigning of the Non-Prosecution Agreement in September 2007, so long as the United States may \nproceed to prosecute your client for \nthose victims identified after that date. If your position is \nthat the Agreement covers all crimes related to victims known to the United \nStates as of June 30, \n2008, then all of those victims should be entitled to compensation. Please advise me of your \nclient's election by Friday morning so that the appropriate revised victim notifications may be \ndistributed \nand I can prepare the final victim list. \nCopies of the victim notifications will continue to be provided to counsel for Mr. Epstein. \nPlease let me know whether I should continue to list Mr. Goldberger as the point of contact for \nthe civil litigation. Regarding your suggestion on the content of the notification letters, I  intend \nto use the same format that was used in the letters \npreviously approved by Messrs. Goldberger \nEFTA00013949\n\nand Tein, except that I  will include the language from the September and October \nagreements. I \nhave enclosed a draft herewith. Because I  previously provided the victims with incorrect \ninformation—albeit with the approval of Mr. Epstein's counsel—it is imperative that I  correct the \nerror promptly. Accordingly, if you have any substantive objections to the letter, \nplease advise \nme by \ntomorrow afternoon. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander \nAcosta \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States \nAttorney \ncc: \nChief, Northern Division \nEFTA00013950",
