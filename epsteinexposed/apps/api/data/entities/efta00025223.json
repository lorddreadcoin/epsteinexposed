I have attached the draft interview questions for for your review. This is still a  draft \nand will certainly be edited prior to the interview. However, I wanted to give you both enough time to review the \nquestions so that you were able to make any edits and/or suggestions that you feel appropriate prior to the interview. I \nonly ask that you make your edits in track changes so that I am clear on what it is you have changed. I have also attached \nthe forms which we, as Dal OIG agents, are required to provide to all employees at the start of their Subject interview. \nPer our conversation, it is my understanding that we will be utilizing the Voluntary Interview Form, but I also wanted to \nprovide you with the Compelled Interview Form, in case you wanted to compare the two to be certain we are all of the \nsame understanding. Finally, we received guidance that we are required to record the interviews, so please let me know if \nyou know (or believe) this to be a problem so that we may address the issue prior to the interview(s). \nThanks very much in advance. I hope you're both having a nice day. \nSSA \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOIG Boston Area Office \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Tuesday, June 8, 2021 9:08 AM \nTo: \n(OIG) \n> \nCc: (USANYS) <> \nSubject: FW: meeting with \n.
