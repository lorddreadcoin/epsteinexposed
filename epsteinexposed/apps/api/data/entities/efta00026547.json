As I mentioned, we would be interested in learning the accounts of your clients, and we would—as we \nhave with all the victims we've spoken to so far—engage with them with the highest levels of sensitivity, including there \nbeing no requirement to discuss any particular event or topic at any time. Even to the extent there are any individuals \nwho would not currently be comfortable speaking with us directly, if they would permit you to provide an attorney proffer \nto us, that also could be very helpful. \nAnd in the first instance, to the extent this is possible, it would be very helpful for us just to be provided the names of your \nclients—we would not attempt to contact them outside of our discussions with you, but knowing who they are will help \nus inadvertently approaching individuals who are in fact represented, and would also help us identify to you any particular \nindividual(s) who might be known to us already. \nWe look forward to being in touch with you soon, and thank you again for being in touch. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Jordan Merson \nSent: Wednesday, January 08, 2020 15:34 \nTo: Colleen Carlo \nc> \nCc: Matthew Merson cM>, Jesse Mautner \nc\nSubject: Re: SDNY criminal investigation \nGood speaking with you. We will relay our discussion to our clients and see if there is interest.
