The District Court, Alesia, J., held that: (1) \nevidence and witnesses' testimony would not be \nsuppressed as result of having been derived from leads \nattributable to suppressed evidence; (2) testimony \nregarding statutory maximum penalty faced by \ngovernment's witnesses was admissible; (3) government \nwould be allowed to recall witnesses during its case in \nchief; (4) evidence regarding weapons possession, taxes, \nand dealings involving large amounts of cash was \nadmissible; (5) district court would not grant additional \nperemptory challenges to defendants; (6) government was \nnot required to put nondefendant participant in \nconversation with one of defendants on stand in order to \nplay tape recordings of conversation; (7) court would \nreserve ruling on marital communications privilege; (8) \nreferences to one of defendants in codefendants' \nconversations did not implicate confrontation clause; and \n(9) government could introduce evidence of incarceration \nof one of defendants. \nMotions denied in part and granted in part. \nWest Headnotes (34) \nIll \nCriminal Law \nS-Searches, seizures, and arrests \nCriminal Law \nS-Search or seizure in general \nExclusionary rule prohibits introduction of \nevidence obtained as direct or indirect result of \nillegal search. \nCases that cite this headnote \n121 \nCriminal Law \nS-Causal nexus; independent discovery or basis \nor source \nWhen disputed evidence is attributable to source \nindependent of illegally obtained primary item, \nindependent source doctrine renders evidence \nadmissible despite primary taint. \nCases that cite this headnote \n131 \nCriminal Law \nS-Inevitable discovery \nWhen disputed evidence inevitably would have \nbeen discovered by lawful means, inevitable \ndiscovery doctrine renders evidence admissible \ndespite primary taint. \nCases that cite this headnote \n19 \nCriminal Law \nS-Causal nexus; independent discovery or basis \nor source \nDefendants, who were charged in connection \nwith alleged drug distribution and money \nlaundering conspiracy, were not entitled to \nsuppression of first defendant's lease, \nidentification and place of purchase of second \ndefendant's boat, and witnesses' testimony, even \nthough lease, boat information, and witnesses \nwere derived from leads attributable to \nsuppressed evidence; lease, boat information, \nand identification and use of witnesses were \nattributable to independent source of discovery. \nWEST LAW © 2019 Thomson \nReuters.

For \nbackground on this case see United States v. Messino, 871 \nF.Supp. 1035 (N.D.I11.1995), and other cases cited at 871 \nF.Supp. at 1037-38 of that opinion. \nI. TAINT ISSUES RELATED TO PREVIOUSLY \nSUPPRESSED EVIDENCE \nOn January 18, 1995, the court conducted a taint hearing \nto determine what, if any, items would be suppressed as \nevidence because of their having been derived from leads \nattributable to already suppressed evidence. The hearings \nwere on the motions of defendants Christopher Richard \nMessino and Clement A. Messino. Based upon the \ncredible evidence of record the court makes the following \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. The court \nconsiders now only those items challenged in defendants' \npost-hearing submissions. \n*1181 A. Findings of Fact \nCredibility Finding \n1. Special Agent Michael Priess, the sole witness at the \nhearing, was a credible witness in all respects. His \ntestimony demonstrated detailed recall of facts \nsurrounding the instant investigation. \nChallenges from Christopher Richard Messina \n2. The lease between Nick Sula and Christopher Richard \nMessino is attributable to an independent source of \ndiscovery. \n3. The government's identification and use of Jerry Haas \nand Lisa Batts as witnesses are attributable to an \nindependent source of discovery. \nChallenges from Clement A. Messino \n4. The government's identification of Clement A. \nMessino's boat and place of purchase are attributable to \nan independent source of discovery. \n5. The government's identification and use of George \nThorpe, John Richard, Phillip Webb, Ed Cozzi, and Frank \nFuscone as witnesses are attributable to an independent \nsource of discovery. \n6. The identity and significance of Chris Smith as a \nwitness would have inevitably been discovered even \nabsent utilization of tainted leads. \n6. Bank records from Interstate Bank of Oak Forest, \nChesterfield Bank, Beverly Bank, Thomridge State Bank, \nEvergreen Plaza Bank, Heritage Bank of Crestwood, First \nNational Bank of Harvey, and First National Bank of Blue \nIsland, as well as any credit card records would, at the \nvery least, have been inevitably discovered even absent \nutilization of tainted leads. \nB. Conclusions of Law \nI. The exclusionary rule prohibits \"the introduction of \nevidence obtained as the direct or indirect result of an \nillegal search.\" United States v. Markling, 7  F.3d 1309, \n1315 (7th Cir.1993) (citing Murray v. United States, 487 \nU.S. 533, 536, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 2532, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 \n(1988)). \n2. Various doctrines define whether evidence not \nprimarily tainted was obtained as a  result of the primary \nillegality. See generally 4 WAYNE R. LAFAVE, \nSEARCH & SEIZURE § 11.4(a) (2d ed. 1987). \n121   3. When the disputed evidence is attributable to a \nsource independent of the illegally obtained primary item, \nthe independent source doctrine renders the evidence \nadmissible despite the primary taint. Markling, 7  F.3d at \nWEST LAW \n© \n2019 Thomson Reuters. \nNo claim to original U.S. Government Works. \n7 \nEFTA00013379\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \n1314-18, 1318 n. I. \nPI 4. When the disputed evidence inevitably would have \nbeen discovered by lawful means, the inevitably \ndiscovery doctrine renders the evidence admissible \ndespite the primary taint. See United States v.  Jackson, \n901 F.2d 83, 84-85 (7th Cir.I 990); Markling, 7  F.3d at \n1318 n. 1. \nC. Holding \n141  151  No further items are suppressed as evidence because \nof tainted leads. \nII. GOVERNMENT'S CONSOLIDATED \nPRE—TRIAL MOTION IN LIMINE \nThe government's motion raises eight separate \nevidentiary issues. \nA. Impeachment of Joseph Granata \nFor reasons discussed under Clement Messino's motion in \n!amine, the government's motion in this regard is granted. \nB. Evidence and Argument of Lawfulness and \nNon-corrupt Conduct \n161   The government's motion in this respect cannot be \nevaluated absent the more specific context provided at \ntrial. Accordingly, in this respect said motion is denied. \nC. Evidence and Argument of Outrageous \nGovernment Conduct \nThe government's motion in this respect cannot be \nevaluated absent the more specific context provided at \ntrial. Accordingly, in this respect said motion is denied. \n*1182 D. Evidence and Argument of Entrapment \nI'll  No defendant has responded to this part of the motion \nby asserting a  right to argue entrapment in opening \nstatements. Accordingly, in this regard the government's \nmotion is denied as moot.' \nE. Mention of Prior Prosecution Experience by \nDefense Counsel \n181  Clement Messino's attorney, as far as the court is \naware, is the only person to whom this argument is \ndirected. Counsel represents he has no intention to \nmention his prosecution experience. On the off chance \nanother attorney or a  witness might introduce the fact of \ncounsel's prosecution experience, the court holds that the \nsubject is irrelevant, and accordingly grants the motion in \nthis regard. FED.R.EVID. 401, 402. \nF. Evidence and Argument About Draft Transcripts \n191  The government does not appear to dispute that a draft \ntranscript prepared by a witness may be used to impeach \nthat witness. Rather the government objects to using the \ndraft against another witness, which would not be proper \nimpeachment. Accordingly, in this regard the \ngovernment's motion is granted.' \nG. Allegations of Witness Wrongdoing Not Involving \nDishonesty \n1101  The government here seeks to regulate impeachment \nof its witnesses at trial. Without context, the court must \nreserve ruling, and accordingly in this respect the \ngovernment's motion is denied. \nH. Maximum Penalties Faced by Witnesses \n1111 The government wants to exclude introduction of the \nstatutory maximum penalty, arguing that such a number is \nmisleading given the realities of sentencing under the \nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines. Such evidence is \nRule 401 relevant to the issue of credibility. To the extent \nthe statutory maximum does not tell the whole story, the \ngovernment is free to explore that on re-direct \nWEST LAW © 2019 \nThomson Reuters.

Accordingly, in this regard the \ngovernment's motion is denied. \nIn conclusion, the Government's Motion in Limine is \ngranted in part, denied in part, and denied as moot in part. \nIII. GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO \nRECALL CERTAIN WITNESSES DURING ITS \nCASE IN CHIEF \n1121   \"  31   In order to present its case in a  \"chronological, \ncoherent manner,\" the government asks to be able to \nrecall certain witnesses during its case in chief. The court \nhas the discretionary authority to allow the case in chief to \nproceed as the government suggests. See United States v. \nDent, 984 F.2d 1453, 1463 (7th Cir.) (citing cases), cert. \ndenied, 510 U.S. 858, 114 S.Ct. 169, 126 L.Ed.2d 129, \nand 510 U.S. 875, 114 S.Ct. 209, 126 L.Ed.2d 165 (1993); \nFED.R.EVID. 611(a). The court agrees with the \ngovernment that, properly executed, its proposal would be \nbeneficial to the jury's following the government's case. \nAccordingly, the Government's Motion for Leave to \nRecall Certain Witnesses During Its Case in Chief is \ngranted. \nIV. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD \nMESSINO'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE \nINCOMPETENT LAW OPINION EVIDENCE, \nEVIDENCE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL \nKNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE BASED UPON \nHEARSAY \nDefendant Christopher Richard Messino's motion, \nphrased as it  is, seeks merely to enforce Rules 602, 701 \nand 802. As long as the court is careful to note that \ndefendant's examples of enforcement of these rules are \nnot necessarily valid, the motion may be granted. \n*1183 Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's Motion \nin Limine to Preclude Incompetent Law Opinion \nEvidence, Evidence Based upon Lack of Personal \nKnowledge and Evidence Based upon Hearsay is granted. \nFED.R.EVID. 602, 701 and 802. \nV.

FED.R.EVID. 401, 402, 403. \nVI. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD \nMESSINO'S OMNIBUS MOTION IN LIMINE \nDefendant Christopher Richard Messino seeks to preclude \nintroduction of sixteen categories of evidence. \nA. Certain Et ents Pe g to Clement \nMessino \nI. Escape \nThe government does not intend to introduce such \nevidence, and so the motion in this regard is denied as \nmoot. \n2. Granata Dealings \nThe court has previously ruled on the Granata \ntransactions, and in this regard the motion is denied. \n3. Gun \nNI Such evidence is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade \ntheory. See United States v. Ramirez, Nos. 93-4056 & \n93-4059, 1995 WL 17808, at •7 (7th Cir. Jan. 19, 1995). \nIn this regard, the motion is denied. \nWESTLAW © 2019 Thomson Reuters.

In this regard the motion is denied. \nB. Tax Evidence for Years Other than 1986 and 1987 \n115) This evidence may be admissible to show no \nlegitimate source of income. See United States v.  Briscoe, \n896 F.2d 1476, 1500 (7th Cir.) (\"It is well settled that in \nnarcotics prosecutions, a defendant's possession and \nexpenditure of large sums of money, as well as his or her \nfailure to file tax returns, are relevant to establish that, in \nall probability, the reason for the failure to report this \nincome is due to the defendant's participation in illegal \nactivities.\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 863, III S.Ct. 173, \n112 L.Ed.2d 137 (1990). Accordingly, in this regard the \nmotion is denied. \nC. Rumors Regarding Murders \nThe government has no intention of introducing any \nmurder issue, so in this regard the motion is denied as \nmoot. \nD. Sex Evidence/Use of Prostitutes \n1161 \n1171  The motion and the government's response raise a \nfew issues here. First, any defendant's use of prostitutes is \nirrelevant and overly prejudicial, absent some special \ncircumstances, which the government does not forward. \nSecond, defendant wants to avoid reference to the fact \nthat some defendants may have had sexual relationships \nwith the same women. The government is right, though, \nto note that it  may be difficult for a  witness to tell her \nstory of her relation to those defendants without \ndiscussing the fact that she dated them. The government \nintends to elicit the information in a \"non-inflammatory\" \nmanner, a representation under which the introduction of \nthe evidence will not be unduly prejudicial. \nIn this regard the motion is granted in part and denied in \npart. \n*1184 E. Possession of Weapons \nThis evidence is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory, \nas discussed above. In this regard the motion is denied. \nF. Loan Sharking \nI'M All the government intends to do here is introduce \nevidence of large cash loans to show defendant's \npossession of such cash as evidence of the conspiracy. \nThis introduction is admissible. See United States v. \nJames, 40 F.3d 850, 861 (7th Cir.1994), cert. denied, No. \n94-7225, 1995 WL 21671 (U.S. Jan. 23, 1995); see also \nBriscoe, 896 F.2d at 1500. In this regard the motion is \ndenied. \nG. Car Theft Activity \nOn this issue the court has previously reserved ruling. In \nthis regard the motion is denied. \nH. Kim Forbes \nDefendant seeks to bar introduction of confidential \nmarital communications. The government agrees with this \ntheory. In this regard the motion is granted, although fact \nissues related to the privilege may arise at trial. \nI. Yvette Gifford \n1191    Defendant raises three objections to predicted \ntestimony by Yvette Gifford regarding aliases, the \ncarrying of a briefcase full of $10,000, and putting assets \nin other persons' names. Depending on context, these \nincidents could be Rule 401 relevant. Also, any \nfoundational issues are properly addressed at trial. In this \nregard the motion is denied. \nJ. Michael Homerding \nDefendant seeks to bar evidence of Homerding being shot \nat, which the government does not seek to introduce. In \nWEST LAW © 2019 \nThomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10 \nEFTA00013382\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \nthis regard the motion is denied as moot. \nK. Timothy Larkin \nTwo concerns are here. First is evidence of an accusation \nby Christopher Richard Messina that Larkin stole money. \nThe government does not seek to introduce such \nevidence. Second is  evidence of large amounts of cash, \nwhich the government is entitled to introduce. In this \nregard the motion is denied as moot in part and denied in \npart. \nL. Mary Beth Maroulis \nHere the motion raises foundational issues, reserved for \ntrial. In this regard the motion is denied. \nM. Dawn Peco \nHere the motion addresses a gun shot incident, which the \ngovernment says it will not introduce. In this regard the \nmotion is denied as moot. \nN. Pete Peco, Jr. \n12.1  Here defendant raises an issue of evidence of a debt \nowed by Gray Chrystall to Christopher Richard Messina. \nThe government's theory is that the debt will be linked up \nwhen viewed in the context of the evidence at trial. \nAccordingly, the court reserves ruling by denying the \nmotion in this regard. \n0. Pete Peco, Sr. \nThe government has agreed not to introduce the disputed \nevidence that Christopher Richard Messina asked this \nwitness to beat up a  certain \"kid.\" Accordingly, in this \nregard the motion is denied as moot. \nP. Terry Saberhagen \nPH The government's theory of the admissibility of \nchallenged testimony by Saberhagen is based on \nSaberhagen's being an unindicted coconspirator. The \ncourt reserves ruling until trial, as the papers cannot \nsupply enough context presently to rule. In this regard the \nmotion is denied. \nIn conclusion, Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's \nOmnibus Motion in Limine is granted in part, denied in \npart, and denied as moot in part. \n*1185 VII. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER \nRICHARD MESSINO'S MOTION FOR \nADDITIONAL PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES \nMI Under Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure, in this non•capital case in which \"the offense \ncharged is punishable by more than one year, the \ngovernment is entitled to 6 peremptory challenges and the \ndefendant or defendants jointly to 10 peremptory \nchallenges.\" FED.R.CRIM.P. 24(b). However, where, as \nhere, \"there is more than one defendant, the court may \nallow the defendants additional peremptory challenges \nand permit them to be exercised separately or jointly.\" Id. \nBoth the language of Rule 24(b) and Seventh Circuit \ncases make clear that \"[t]he decision whether to grant \nadditional peremptory challenges in multi-defendant trials \n... lies within the sound discretion of the district court.\" \nUnited States v. Cochran, 955 F.2d 1116, 1121 (7th Cir.) \n(citing United States v. Farmer, 924 F.2d 647, 653 (7th \nCir.I99 I)), cert. denied, — U.S. 113 S.Ct. 460, \n121 L.Ed.2d 368 (1992). \nP1 \nDefendant Christopher Richard Messino argues that \nbecause potential jurors in this case face a  lengthy trial, \nadditional peremptory challenges are necessary. At the \ntime of the motion, eleven defendants were going to trial, \nand defendant argued that each of the eleven defendants \ngoing to trial should be allotted three peremptory \nchallenges. While the court is aware that the length of a \ntrial may complicate the jury selection process,' the \nperemptory challenge plan defendant proposes is not one \nthe court in its discretion will employ. \nWith eight defendants going to trial as the court writes, \nthe court collectively will allow the defendants ten \nperemptory challenges.s Each defendant will have sole \nauthority over one challenge. The defendants should come \nto agreement on exercising the remaining challenges. \nAccordingly, Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's \nWESTLAW © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11 \nEFTA00013383\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \nMotion for Additional Peremptory Challenges is denied. \nVIII. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD \nMESSINO'S MOTION FOR PRODUCTION OF \nEXCULPATORY OR IMPEACHING MATERIAL \nDefendant seeks material pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, \n373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and \nGiglio v.  United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 \nL.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Specifically, defendant seeks \ninformation regarding three individuals: Fred Maleki, \nCindy Delapena and Patrick Tobin. Regarding Tobin, the \ngovernment represents that it has no written statements. \nRegarding Maleki and Delapena, the government asserts \nthat (1) it does not intend to call those witnesses; and (2) \nnone of the material on them is exculpatory. \n1241 1251 The court has verified through in camera \ninspection that the government's files on Malcki and \nDelapena do not contain Brady material. Brady bars the \nprosecution from withholding \"evidence that is favorable \nto the defendant and material to an issue at trial.\" United \nStates v. Carson, 9 F.3d 576, 582 (7th Cir.1993), cert. \ndenied, 513 U.S. 844, 115 S.Ct. 135, 130 L.Ed.2d 77 \n(1994). The Delapena Grand Jury testimony does not \nmeet this test. Stretching materiality to its limits, one \ncould argue that on some theory Delapena's absence of \nknowledge of any illegality on the part of Christopher \nRichard Messino makes her testimony material. But a \nBrady materiality determination is not a search for mere \npossibilities. Id., 9  F.3d at 583. Under this analysis the \ncourt will not order production of the Delapena testimony. \nSimilarly, Maleki's testimony need not be produced by \nthe government. The court's inspection of the testimony \nreveals no Brady material. \n*1186 Accordingly, Defendant Christopher Richard \nMessina's Motion to Produce Exculpatory or Impeaching \nInformation is denied. \nIX. DEFENDANT CLEMENT A. MESSINO'S \nMOHON IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE CERTAIN \nEVIDENCE \nDefendant Clement Messina raises five issues. \nA. Granata Transactions \n1261   The government apparently has defendant Clement \nMessino on tape with Joseph Granata, who was \ntransmitting the conversation on behalf of the \ngovernment. The government wants to play the tapes \nwithout putting Granata himself on the witness stand. \nClement Messino's motion in this regard seeks to prevent \nthe government from playing the tapes unless Granata \ntestifies. \nThe court finds the Seventh Circuit's decision in United \nStates v. McClain, 934 F.2d 822 (7th Cir.1991), \ninstructive. In McClain, the Seventh Circuit approved \nadmission of tapes even where the government did not put \nthe non-defendant participant in the conversation on the \nstand. Id. at 832. The district court also in that case \nproperly denied the opportunity of the defendant to \nimpeach the non-defendant should the defendant call him. \nId. The foundational and Sixth Amendment issues here \nare no different than in McClain.' \nThis is not a  ruling on foundation issues or any other \naspect of any Granata tapes. This is merely a ruling on \nwhether some per se requirement prevents the \ngovernment from introducing the Granata tapes without \nGranata. The court finds no such requirement, and so in \nthis regard denies defendant's motion. \nIn Defendant has, however, noted transcript portions that \nthe court agrees are objectionable and will exclude. \nSpecifically, defendant objects to September 15 and 16, \n1991, references potentially to intimidating or even \nmurdering a government witness. Both instances have two \nproblematic aspects. First, it is not entirely clear that \nClement Messino in either instance is agreeing to or \nencouraging such intimidation. Second, either through \ninaudibility or truncated transmission the transcripts are \nincomplete. When the subject matter is so potentially \ninflammatory, the better course is to exclude those \nportions of the transcripts. In this regard, therefore, \ndefendant's motion is granted. \nB. Pamela Messino \nThere is no question that Pamela Messino and defendant \nClement Messino have been legally married since 1968. \nThey are apparently married now and were married at all \ntimes relevant to this case. Defendant's motion raises the \nimplications of that fact for the evidence in this case, \nbased on the confidential marital communications \nprivilege. United States v.  Keck, 773 F.2d 759, 767 (7th \nCir. 1985). \nWEST LAW \n© 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12 \nEFTA00013384\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \n1281  1291  The court does not reach issues of the confidential \nmarital communications privilege, because there is a \nthreshold issue of whether the adverse spousal testimony \nprivilege will apply. See Keck, 773 F.2d at 767. By the \ngovernment's own description, this privilege gives a \nperson presently married to a criminal defendant the right \nnot to testify against his or her spouse. See United States \nv. Fulk, 816 F.2d 1202, 1205 (7th Cir.1987). The \ngovernment has two reasons why the adverse spousal \ntestimony privilege will not apply: first, Pamela Messino \nis not asserting the privilege (as only she can assert it); \nand second, the marriage is a sham. \n1101  As far as the first point, Clement Messino's counsel's \ninformation is that Pamela Messino will assert the \nprivilege. (See Defendant Clement Messino's Reply \nMemorandum in Support of Motion in Limine to Exclude \nCertain Evidence at 9 n. 5.) Therefore, questions under \nthis privilege may arise. As far as the second point, as the \nstrength of the marriage is contested by defendant, the \ngovernment would have to •1187 prove up any exception, \nor at least present uncontested facts on which the \nexception would be based. See generally United States v. \nClark, 712 F.2d 299 (7th Cir.1983). Such a  prove up \nwould undoubtedly resolve many of the issues as to the \nconfidential marital communications privilege, which \nClement Messino himself can invoke. Nonetheless, the \nadverse spousal testimony privilege is a threshold matter. \nThe court reserves the factual determinations necessary to \nrule on the privileges until trial, and accordingly denies \ndefendant's motion in this regard. \nC. Michael Gubbins \n1311  As the briefing came to a  close, all defendant wants \nhere is to obligate the government, before presenting \nattorney-client communications, to establish out of \nhearing of the jury that an exception to the privilege \noperates. This is a  safe and reasonable request, so the \nmotion in this regard is granted.' \nD. \"Post-conspiracy\" Evidence \nDefendant here challenges transcript portions from five \ndates: January 7, 1992; January 28, 1992; March 3, 1992; \nMarch 15, 1993; and April 7, 1993. \n1. January 7 and 28, 1992 \nThe court agrees that the January 7 and 28, 1992, \nstatements are, as a preliminary matter, admissible under \nRule 801(dX2)(E). \n2. April 7, 1993 \nThe government concedes that the April 7, 1993, \nconversation should be redacted as in Exhibit E-5 to \ndefendant's motion. \n3. March 3 and IS, 1993 \nAs to the March 3  and IS, 1992, conversations, the \ngovernment's position is that while those conversations \nadmittedly took place after the end of the charged \nconspiracy (and therefore Rule 801(dX2)(E) does not \napply), the proposed redactions are too broad. \n1~~1  Since this is not an 801(dX2)(E) admission, issues \narise under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 \nS.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). \"[A] defendant is \ndeprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause \nwhen his nontestifying codefendant's confession naming \nhim as a  participant in the crime is  introduced at their \njoint trial, even if the jury is  instructed to consider that \nconfession only against the codefendant.\" Richardson v. \nMarsh, 481 U.S. 200, 201-02, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1704, 95 \nL.Ed.2d 176 (1987). The Richardson court makes clear \nthat the references to Clement Messino that he notes do \nnot present a  Bruton problem because those references \nrequire \"linkage\" to Clement Messino before they \nimplicate him. Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1708. The \ngovernment is right here, and therefore the redactions \nshould be as the government proposes. Accordingly, in \nthis regard defendant's motion is granted in part and \ndenied in part. \nWEST LAW \n© \n2019 Thomson \nReuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13 \nEFTA00013385\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \nE. Other \nIssues \n1. Incarceration \nDefendant wishes to avoid introduction of any \nevidence of his incarceration. The government's most \nimportant response, with which defendant never comes to \ngrips, is that paragraph eleven of Count I of the \nSuperseding Indictment specifically charges that Clement \nMessino directed coconspirators while incarcerated. \nIntroduction of evidence of incarceration is therefore hard \nto avoid. \nIn this regard defendant's motion is denied. \n2. Escape \nThe government does not intend to introduce specific \nevidence of defendant's escape, so the motion in this \nregard is denied as moot. \n3. Employment as Police Officer \nThe motion in this regard is denied. FED.R.EVID. 401, \n402. \n4. Organized Crime References \nThe government does not intend to introduce references to \norganized crime, except perhaps for a statement by \nClement Messina that he is a  good gangster because he \nused to be a police officer. The court has been provided a \nparaphrased snippet of testimony from a  witness about \nwhom it has heard little *1188 or nothing in the context of \nthis case. The court must therefore reserve ruling, and the \nmotion is accordingly denied. \nIn conclusion Defendant Clement Messino's Motion in \nLimine to Exclude Certain Evidence is granted in part, \ndenied in part, and denied as moot in part. \nX. DEFENDANT DONALD SOUTHERN'S \nMOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE VARIOUS \nINADMISSIBLE STATEMENTS \nDefendant Donald Southern raises two evidentiary issues \nregarding (1) statements of presumption, guesses or \nconclusions by lay witnesses, and (2) testimony of \nSouthern's role without personal knowledge, unless \nfoundation is laid or Rule 80 1(dX2)(E) applies. This is in \nthe category of motions to have the Federal Rules of \nEvidence apply to the trial. \nAccordingly, Defendant Donald Southern's Motion in \nLimine to Preclude Various Inadmissible Statements is \ngranted. \nXI. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER B. MESSINO'S \nMOTION IN LIMINE WITH REGARD TO \nCERTAIN EVIDENCE \nChristopher B. Messino raises two evidentiary issues. \nA. Evidence of Violence of Christopher B. Messino \nThe government rightly points out that the court has \nreserved ruling here. Accordingly, in this respect the \nmotion is denied. \nB. Evidence Regarding Isolated Incidents of Small \nControlled Substance Deliveries \nlit \nThe government will attempt to prove that defendant \nsold small amounts of cocaine during the course of and in \nfurtherance of the conspiracy. Furthermore, defendant's \nmotion is too vague to warrant a ruling that all incidents \nfitting into defendant's description should be excluded. \nAccordingly, in this respect the motion is denied. \nDefendant Christopher B. Messino's Motion in Limine \nwith Regard to Certain Evidence is denied. \nWESTLAW © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S Government Works. \n14 \nEFTA00013386\n\nU.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \nXII. DEFENDANT BLAISE MESSINO'S MOTION \nIN LIMINE REGARDING THE INTRODUCHON \nOF CERTAIN EVIDENCE \nDefendant Blaise Messino raises two issues. \nA. Possession of Firearms \nAt least as a preliminary matter, evidence of possession of \nfirearms is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory. \nB. Violence \nIssues regarding evidence of violence have been reserved \nfor trial. \nDefendant Blaise Messino's Motion in Limine Regarding \nthe Introduction of Certain Evidence is denied. \nXIII. DEFENDANT PAUL MESSINO'S MOTION \nIN LIMINE REGARDING INTRODUCHON OF \nCERTAIN EVIDENCE \nPaul Messino's motion in conclusory fashion raises seven \nevidentiary issues. \nA. Evidence of Robberies or a Fight \nThe government either does not intend to introduce such \nevidence or correctly notes the motion is not specific \nenough to support a ruling. In this respect the motion is \ndenied. \nB. Evidence Regarding His Possession of Weapons \nIn this respect defendant's motion is denied. The evidence \nmay be admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory. \nC. Evidence of Violence \nIn this respect defendant's motion is denied. the court \nreserving ruling. \nD. Evidence of Drug Deliveries Outside of Charged \nConspiracy \nDefendant's cursory request here is too vague and \noverbroad to support a  ruling. *1189 Accordingly, the \nmotion in this respect is denied. \nE. Evidence of Involvement with Stolen Vehicles \nThe government correctly notes that the court has \npreviously reserved ruling on this issue. In this respect the \nmotion is denied. \nF. Evidence that Paul Messino Traveled to Florida to \nPick Up Cocaine for Clement Messino or Others \nAmong other things, this conduct would seem to be part \nof the heart of the case against Paul Messino. The motion \nin this regard is without basis and is denied. \nG. Evidence that Defendant Sold Cocaine to \nConfidential Informant Unless Informant is Produced \nfor Cross-examination \nThe government argues that there is no such requirement. \nHowever, any legal issue here is mooted because the \ngovernment intends to produce informants in that \ncategory. In this regard the motion is denied as moot. \nIn conclusion, Defendant Paul Messino's Motion in \nLimine Regarding Introduction of Certain Evidence is \ndenied in part and denied as moot in part. \nWESTLAW © 2019 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. \n15 \nEFTA00013387\n\nU.S. v. MossIno, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) \nCONCLUSION \nNo further items are suppressed as evidence because of \ntainted leads. Government's Motion in Limine is granted \nin part, denied in part, and denied as moot in part. \nGovernment's Motion for Leave to Recall Certain \nWitnesses During Its Case in Chief is granted. Defendant \nChristopher Richard Messino's Motion in Limine to \nPreclude Incompetent Law Opinion Evidence, Evidence \nBased upon Lack of Personal Knowledge and Evidence \nBased upon Hearsay is granted. Defendant Christopher \nRichard Messino's Motion in Limine to Preclude \nEvidence Regarding Christopher Richard Messino's \nEmployment as a  Police Officer is denied. Defendant \nChristopher Richard Messino's Omnibus Motion in \nLimine is granted in part, denied in part, and denied as \nmoot in part. Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's \nMotion for Additional Peremptory Challenges is denied. \nDefendant Christopher Richard Messino's Motion to \nFootnotes \nProduce Exculpatory or Impeaching Information is \ndenied. Defendant Clement Messino's Motion in Limine \nto Exclude Certain Evidence is granted in part, denied in \npart, and denied as moot in part. Defendant Donald \nSouthern's Motion in Limine to Preclude Various \nInadmissible Statements is granted. Defendant \nChristopher B. Messino's Motion in Limine with Regard \nto Certain Evidence is denied. Defendant Blaise \nMessino's Motion in Limine Regarding the Introduction \nof Certain Evidence is denied. Defendant Paul Messino's \nMotion in Limine Regarding Introduction of Certain \nEvidence is denied in part and denied as moot in part. \nAll Citations \n873 F.Supp. 1177 \nThe course of trial may raise other entrapment issues. For now, the court considers only opening statements. \n2 \nAny attempt by defendants to use the drafts for other purposes would be evaluated at trial. \n3 \nThe government wants to preclude evidence that any of its witnesses once worked as prostitutes, but presents no motion. The \ndefendants therefore have not properly been afforded an opportunity to present a theory of relevance. \n4 \nLength of trial is the only reason defendant offers for his jury selection plan. Ile does not raise the issue of conflicting trial strategy. \nThe court nonetheless has taken that danger into consideration and concludes that no conflicting trial strategy problem warrants the \nplan defendant proposes. See Oxtan, 955 F.2d at 1121. \n5 \nOf course the government will have six challenges, as prescribed by Rule 24(b). \n6 \nIn McClain the Seventh Circuit discussed limiting instructions for this situation, 934 F.2d at 832, which the government should \nproffer. \n7 \nThe court finds no waiver of the privilege on the record it now has. \nEnd of Document C 2019 Thomson Reuters.
