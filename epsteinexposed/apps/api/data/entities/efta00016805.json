November 2016 20:05 \nAn: \nCc: 'Goldscheider, Peter'; Kuffner, Gudrun \nBetreff: introduction to Mr Peter Goldscheider, fouding partner of EPIC Invest ( investment bank \nfrom Vienna, Austira, mainly focused on Eastern European investments and advisory ) \nDear Mr. Jorge Costa e Silva, \nAs per our conversation yesterday, I  would like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Goldscheider, founding partner of EPIC Invest, an \ninvestment bank/private equity group based in Vienna, Austria, that focus Its Investments In Eastern European countries. \nMr. Goldscheider•( pls see his bio below) ,  is a prominent financier, and one of the largest players in past privatizations of Eastern \nEuropean companies. Pls see the website for his investment bank ,  EPIC Invest. \nhttp://www.epicinvest.com/about-epjtv\nA history of his past deals can be found under \"  references\" in the website. \nEFTA00016806\n\nI  mentioned to him about Mr .Carlos Sanchez investment in the pharmaceutical co. Galenika of Serbia, and he will be delighted to \nmeet you and him, as EPIC has a  very good team of professionals in Beograd. \nAlso, he has a  very interesting investment in Montenegro ( pls see presentation in PDF attached), that may fit Mr. Sanchez's \ninvestment goals. \nPlease see below a  list of his other investment opportunities in the US, Croatia and Montenegro. \n1. Information on Peter's major US investment can be found at \nwww.rivada.com \n2. Information on our Croatian tourism investment is available at \nwww.valamar.com \nLastly, I  am attaching a description of the Montenegrin high-end hospitality investment, which is \nto become Auberge Resorts' fi rst venture into Europe. The particular appeal of this project lies in the \nteam composition, which can be seen as a seal of quality, opening up the local market to an entirely \nnew and high-end customer segment. Please find more information on Auberge at \nhttps://aubergeresons.corn/ \nMontenegro disposes of the arguably most beautiful coastline in the region and has created \ninvestment conditions, which guarantee maximum protection to FDI. In addition to these generally \nfavorable prerequisites to a successful investment we should also mention that the political backing \nhas been ensured through extensive diplomatic exchange especially with the USA. \nPETER GOLDSCHEIDER,  MANAGING PARTNER \nPeter Goldscheider has more than 25 years experience as a senior executive in the securities and finance industry. \nBefore jointly establishing EPIC with Gustav Wurmbock, he was Vice President for Marketing and Sales and Board \nMember Board of Zurich Kosmos Insurance Company in Austria, and he began his professional career with IBM \nAustria, serving in a number of executive positions. \nHis professional activities included serving as Chairman of the Board of EPIC (Advisors) Russia Ltd. and I.
