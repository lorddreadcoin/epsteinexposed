Here's what you need to know to start your day. \n•  Venture capital firms deny seeking PPP loans. \n•  The Fed's Bostic warns the recovery is stalling. \n•  Ghislaine Maxwell arrives in New York for hearing. \nFive Things You Need to Know \nA handful of venture capital firms said they didn't seek bailouts or get \nmoney even though yesterday's list of PPP recipients showed otherwise. \nIndex Ventures and Foundation Capital, both listed as having been \napproved for more than $1 million, are among those saying they never \napplied for funding. Andreessen Horowitz's loan in question went to a \nportfolio company for which it's the beneficial owner. \nThe list also included: Companies with ties to President Trump,  more \nthan 88,000 loans for religious organizations, a number of investment firms \nand some nonprofit groups that advocate against such massive \ngovernment spending. Chinese companies including conglomerate HNA \nand affiliates of a state-owned defense giant were among recipients. Jacob \nGottlieb, whose $8 billion hedge fund shut amid an insider trading \nscandal also appeared. And agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting \ncompanies got at least $6.4 billion. \nVirus latest: Novavax got a $1.6 billion U.S. award for vaccine \ndevelopment. Shares jumped 27% premarket. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance \nBottoms said she tested positive. Texas cases rose 2.7%, pushing total \ninfections above 200,000. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro underwent another test \nafter showing symptoms. The Australian state of Victoria announced a six-\nweek lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne. Follow the developments \nwith our Virus Update. \nEFTA00026424\n\nEurope's economy will be hit more than previously estimated this year \nand take longer to recover, the European Commission said. It sees euro-\narea GDP slumping 8.7%, a percentage point deeper than it predicted in \nMay, with risks high and mainly to the downside. Forecasts for France, \nItaly and Spain were lowered to contractions of more than 10%, while \nGermany was upgraded a tad to -6.3%. \nU.S. futures fell with shares in Europe and Asia. Treasuries and the dollar \nrose. Oil and gold declined. The Aussie slipped after Melbourne was \nlocked down. All Stoxx Europe 600 industry groups declined and Bayer \nslid after its plan for handling future Roundup cancer claims hit a snag. In \nAsia, Chinese stocks powered ahead for a sixth day. \nMap of the Day \nKeystone XL hit a roadblock. The Supreme Court voted to bar U.S. \nconstruction on the oil-sands pipe, dealing a blow to Trump's bid to \nproceed and to Canadian producers wanting to move more oil across the \nborder. Most work will be delayed to next year, unless Joe Biden wins the \nelection that is. He's vowed to veto the project. \nSponsored Content by The Motley Fool \nWondering How to Invest Right Now? \nWorried about the market? Not sure which stocks to buy?

Click here if you're ready to \njoin now. \nWhat to Keep an Eye On \nThe U.S. rebound is at risk of stalling because of the Sun Belt infection \nspike, Fed official Raphael Bostic said. High-frequency data showed a \nEFTA00026425\n\nleveling off of business openings and mobility, the Atlanta Fed chief told \nthe FT. The trajectory will be \"a bit bumpier than it might otherwise.\" \nThe U.S. may ban TikTok. Michael Pompeo told Fox he's looking at a ban \non Chinese social media apps, specifically TikTok. The company \nwill remove its app from Hong Kong stores in coming days, the first \ninternet service to exit the city after China enacted new national security \nlaws. Its pullout may benefit Beijing by removing a forum pro-democracy \nprotesters use to post videos. \nTech industry concerns overshadowed Samsung's profit beat. Operating \nprofit of 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) beat consensus for 6.2 trillion won. \nShares fell as the figures were helped by a one-time gain in the display \nbusiness, which some analysts estimated was more than 1 trillion won in \ncompensation from Apple for fewer-than-promised display orders, \nsuggesting weakness in the sector. \nJeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook will testify to \nCongress on July 27 The appearances before a panel investigating \ncompetition in the tech industry may be virtual. It's Bezos's first time to \ntestify. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are set to meet \ntoday, after major advertisers boycotted Facebook for not doing enough to \ncombat racism and voter suppression. \ncivil rights leaders \nOpinion \nChina's future credibility will be determined by how it treats Hong Kong, \nBloomberg Opinion's editors write. Beijing may have imposed the national \nsecurity law because its believes Western rivals are in disarray, or to \ndistract from its weakened economy. Nations should oppose \nChina's attempts to assert territorial claims by force, weaken international \ninstitutions and advance goals through intimidation. \nThis may be the time for investors who want to save the Brazilian \nAmazon, writes Clara Ferreira Marques for Bloomberg Opinion. They can \nsupport green incentives or threaten to divest with the promise to reinvest \nif behavior improves. Investors can't dictate government action, but they \ncan point to portfolio risk and cause plenty of pain. Money talks. \nWhat Everybody's Talking About \nEFTA00026426\n\nThe woman who called the police on a Black man watching birds in \nCentral Park in May was charged with falsely reporting an incident, a \nmisdemeanor. Amy Cooper, who's White, accused the bird watcher, \nChristian Cooper (no relation), of threatening to attack her after he asked \nher to keep her dog on a leash. A video of the encounter was posted to \nFacebook, where it went viral. \nGhislaine Maxwell, who's being held in a federal jail in New York, is likely \nto be formally charged and enter a plea on July 14. District Judge Alison \nNathan proposed the hearing be held by videoconference. The former \nJeffrey Epstein associate agreed to the remote hearing and the date in a \nletter to the judge. \nBy the Way \nThe Kansas City Chiefs locked in the NFL's most dynamic player for \nanother decade. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes agreed to a 10-year \nextension worth up to $503 million, the AP reported. Mahomes, 24, took \nthe Chiefs to their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. It's the richest contract \nin professional sports history, surpassing Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal \nwith the Angels. \nPhotographer: Tom Pennington/Getty \nFOLLOW US \ns• \nGET THE NEWSLETTER \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to Bloomberg's The Bloomberg Open —\nAmericas newsletter. \nUnsubscribe I Bloomberg.com I Contact Us \nBloomberg L.P. 731 Lexington, New York, NY, 10022 \nEFTA00026427",
