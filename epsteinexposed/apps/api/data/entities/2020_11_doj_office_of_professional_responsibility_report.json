DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE REPORT OR \nITS  CONTENTS  WITHOUT  THE  PRIOR  APPROVAL  OF  THE  OFFICE  OF  \nPROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n \nThe  Department  of  Justice  (Department)  Office  of  Professional  Responsibility  (OPR)  \ninvestigated  allegations  that  in  2007-2008,  prosecutors  in  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  \nSouthern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal \nconduct  of  Jeffrey  Epstein  by  negotiating  and  executing  a  federal  non-prosecution  agreement  \n(NPA).  The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged \nin illegal sexual activity with girls.\n1\n  OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed \nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was \nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.   \nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein \nin 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.  \nEpstein  was  a  multi-millionaire  financier  with  residences  in  Palm  Beach,  New  York  City,  and  \nother United States and foreign locations.  The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used \npersonal  assistants  to  recruit  girls  to  provide  massages  to  him,  and  in  many  instances,  those  \nmassages led to sexual activity.  After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney’s Office, a \nPalm  Beach  County  grand  jury  indicted  Epstein,  on  July  19,  2006,  for  felony  solicitation  of  \nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07.  However, because the PBPD Chief and the \nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s handling of the case and believed that \nthe  state  grand  jury’s  charge  did  not  address  the  totality  of  Epstein’s  conduct,  they  referred  the  \nmatter  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  in  West  Palm  Beach  for  a  possible  federal  \ninvestigation.  \nThe FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with \nher  supervisor’s  approval  and  with  the  knowledge  of  then  U.S.  Attorney  R.  Alexander  Acosta.    \nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course \nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims.  In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her \nsupervisors  a  draft  60-count  indictment  outlining  charges  against  Epstein.    She  also  provided  a  \nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and \naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. \nFor  several  weeks  following  submission  of  the  prosecution  memorandum  and  proposed  \nindictment,  the  AUSA’s  supervisors  reviewed  the  case  to  determine  how  to  proceed.    At  a    \nJuly  31,  2007  meeting  with  Epstein’s  attorneys,  the  USAO  offered  to  end  its  investigation  if  \nEpstein  pled  guilty  to  state  charges,  agreed  to  serve  a  minimum  of  two  years’  incarceration,  \nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain \nmonetary damages.  The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications \nwith Epstein’s team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the \nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007.  The \n                                                 \n1\n  As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who \nwere under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct.   Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age \nof 18. \n\nii \n \nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against \nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require \nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, \nin  violation  of  Florida  Statute  §  796.03.    The  NPA  required  Epstein  to  make  a  binding  \nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed \nby 12 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”).  The NPA also included \nprovisions  designed  to  facilitate  the  victims’  recovery  of  monetary  damages  from  Epstein.    In  \nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in \nthe  Southern  District  of  Florida  of  him,  four  named  co-conspirators,  and  “any  potential  \nco-conspirators.”  Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or \nthe NPA prior to its signing.         \nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration, \nhowever.  For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys \nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously \nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no \nfederal  interest  at  issue  and  the  matter  should  be  left  to  the  discretion  of  state  law  enforcement  \nofficials.    Through  repeated  communications  with  the  USAO  and  senior  Department  officials,  \ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms.  They also sought and \nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral,  primarily  on  the  issue  of  federal  jurisdiction  over  what  the  defense  insisted  was  “a  \nquintessentially  state  matter.”    After  reviewing  submissions  by  the  defense  and  the  USAO,  on  \nJune  23,  2008,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Attorney  General  informed  defense  counsel  that  the  \nDeputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter.  Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill \nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to \nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, \nto  a  criminal  information  charging  him  with  procurement  of  minors  to  engage  in  prostitution.    \nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the \ncourt  immediately  sentenced  Epstein  to  consecutive  terms  of  12  months’  incarceration  on  the  \nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months \nof community control.  Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm \nBeach County facility.  A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.          \nOn July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated  the Crime Victims’ \nRights  Act  (CVRA),  18  U.S.C.  §  3771,  when  it  resolved  the  federal  investigation  of  Epstein  \nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.\n2\n  In responding to \nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did \nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective \norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.  After the initial filings and \nhearings,  the  CVRA  case  was  dormant  for  almost  two  years  while  the  petitioners  pursued  civil  \ncases against Epstein.  \n                                                 \n2\n  Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, \nDoe v. United States, Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008).  Another victim subsequently joined \nthe litigation as “Jane Doe 2.” \n\niii \n \nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work \nrelease  program,  and  the  Sheriff  approved  his  application.    In  October  2008,  Epstein  began  \nspending  12  hours  a  day  purportedly  working  at  the  “Florida  Science  Foundation,”  an  entity  \nEpstein  had  recently  incorporated  that  was  co-located  at  the  West  Palm  Beach  office  of  one  of  \nEpstein’s attorneys.  Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein \nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months \nof incarceration.  On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home \ndetention  as  a  condition  of  community  control,  and  he  registered  as  a  sexual  offender  with  the  \nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement.  After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts \nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge \nin September 2009 ordered it to be made public.   \nBy  mid-2010,  Epstein  reportedly  settled  multiple  civil  lawsuits  brought  against  him  by  \nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation.  During \nthe  CVRA  litigation,  the  petitioners  sought  discovery  from  the  USAO,  which  made  substantial  \ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and \nsubmitted  declarations  from  the  AUSA  and  the  FBI  case  agents  who  conducted  the  federal  \ninvestigation.    The  USAO  opposed  efforts  to  unseal  various  records,  as  did  Epstein,  who  was  \npermitted  to  intervene  in  the  litigation  with  respect  to  certain  issues.    Nevertheless,  the  court  \nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case \nbe made public.  During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting \nthe CVRA.  After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment \nremained pending for more than a year.     \nIn  2017,  President  Donald  Trump  nominated  Acosta  to  be  Secretary  of  Labor.    At  his  \nMarch 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.  On  \nApril 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.    \nIn  the  decade  following  his  release  from  incarceration,  Epstein  reportedly  continued  to  \nsettle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.  Epstein was otherwise able \nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.  On November 28, 2018, \nhowever,  the  Miami  Herald  published  an  extensive  investigative  report  about  state  and  federal  \ncriminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced \ngirls  into  engaging  in  sexual  activity  with  him  at  his  Palm  Beach  estate.\n3\n  The  Miami  Herald \nreported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the \nNPA,  which  permitted  Epstein  to  avoid  federal  prosecution  and  a  potentially  lengthy  prison  \nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.”  According to the Miami \nHerald,   the   government   also   immunized   from   prosecution   Epstein’s   co-conspirators   and   \nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.  Through its reporting, which included \ninterviews  of  eight  victims  and  information  from  publicly  available  documents,  the  newspaper  \npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a \nwealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime” \nthat allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his \n                                                 \n3\n    Julie  K.  Brown,  “Perversion  of  Justice,”  Miami  Herald,  Nov.  28,  2018.    https://www.miamiherald.com/  \nnews/local/article220097825 html.   \n\niv \n \nabuse  of  minors.    The  Miami  Herald  report  led  to  public  outrage  and  media  scrutiny  of  the  \ngovernment’s actions.\n4\n    \nOn  February  21,  2019,  the  district  court  granted  the  CVRA  case  petitioners’  Motion  for  \nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the \nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.\n5\n  The court also found that letters the government \nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic] \nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.”  The court also highlighted \nthe  inequity  of  the  USAO’s  failure  to  communicate  with  the  victims  while  at  the  same  time  \nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA \nwould  not  be  “made  public  or  filed  with  the  court.”    The  court  ordered  the  parties  to  submit  \nadditional  briefs  regarding  the  appropriate  remedies.    After  the  court’s  order,  the  Department  \nrecused  the  USAO  from  the  CVRA  litigation  and  assigned  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  \nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.  Among the remedies sought \nby  the  petitioners,  and  opposed  by  the  government,  was  rescission  of  the  NPA  and  federal  \nprosecution of Epstein.     \nOn July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained \na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and \none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.  The indictment alleged that from \n2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida \nwhom he sexually abused and exploited.  Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019.  In \narguing  for  Epstein’s  pretrial  detention,  prosecutors  asserted  that  agents  searching  Epstein’s  \nManhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least \none believed to be a minor.  The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded \nto  the  custody  of  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  and  held  at  the  Metropolitan  Correctional  Center  in  \nManhattan.   \nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and \nCongress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the \nNPA.  On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s \nactions.  Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office “was ready to allow Epstein to \nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.”  According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered \nthis  outcome  unacceptable,  his  office  pursued  a  difficult  and  challenging  case  and  obtained  a  \nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims \nwith  the  means  to  obtain  monetary  damages.    Acosta’s  press  conference  did  not  end  the  \ncontroversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as \n                                                 \n4\n  See,  e.g., Ashley  Collman,  “Stunning  new  report  details  Trump’s  labor  secretary’s  role  in  plea  deal  for  \nbillionaire  sex  abuser,”  The  Business  Insider,  Nov.  29,  2018;  Cynthia  McFadden,  “New  Focus  on  Trump  Labor  \nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2018; Anita \nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for attorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington \nBureau,  Nov.  29,  2018;  Emily  Peck,  “How  Trump’s  Labor  Secretary  Covered  For  A  Millionaire  Sex  Abuser,”  \nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2018; Julie K. Brown, et al., “Lawmakers issue call for investigation of serial sex abuser \nJeffrey Epstein’s plea deal,” Miami Herald, Dec. 6, 2018. \n5\n  Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201 (S.D. Fla., Feb. 21, 2019) (Opinion and Order, 9:08-80736-CIV-\nMarra).    \n\nv \n \nSecretary of Labor.  In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on \nhis  handling  of  the  Epstein  investigation  rather  than  on  the  economy  was  unfair  to  the  Labor  \nDepartment.   \nOn August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.  \nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide.   \nAs  a  result  of  Epstein’s  death,  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  Southern  District  of    \nNew  York  filed  a  nolle  prosequi  to  dismiss  the  pending  indictment  against  Epstein.    On    \nAugust  27,  2019,  the  district  court  held  a  hearing  at  which  more  than  a  dozen  of  Epstein’s  \nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke \nabout   the   impact   of   Epstein’s   crimes.      The   court   dismissed   the   Epstein   indictment   on      \nAugust 29, 2019.  \nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation \ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.  Among its findings, \nthe  court  concluded  that  although  the  government  had  violated  the  CVRA,  the  government  had  \nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had \nnot  litigated  in  bad  faith.    The  court  also  noted  it  expected  the  government  to  “honor  its  \nrepresentation  that  it  will  provide  training  to  its  employees  about  the  CVRA  and  the  proper  \ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.   \nOn September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe 1” filed in her true name a petition \nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking \nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies.  In its responsive brief, \nthe government argued that “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach \nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern \nDistrict  of  Florida]  because  no  criminal  charges  were  brought.”    Nevertheless,  during  oral  \nargument,  the  government  conceded  that  the  USAO  had  not  been  “fully  transparent”  with  the  \npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in \nfact the NPA had been signed.”  On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied \nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged.  \nOn August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s \nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set \nfor December 3, 2020.  \nII. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION \n            After            the            Miami  Herald  published  its  investigative  report  on  November  28,  2018,    \nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency \nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami \nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this \nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys.”  On February 6, 2019, the \nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened \n\nvi \n \nan  investigation  into  the  matter  and  would  review  the  USAO’s  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.\n6\n  \n After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR \nincluded  within  the  scope  of  its  investigation  an  examination  of  the  government’s  conduct  that  \nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford \nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was \nsigned  and  that  the  government  affirmatively  misled  victims  about  the  status  of  the  federal  \ninvestigation. \n During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands \nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of \nthe Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  \nThe records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected \nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein.  OPR also \nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and \nother  court  records,  and  reviewed  media  reports  and  interviews,  articles,  podcasts,  and  books  \nrelating to the Epstein case.      \nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews \nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; \ncurrent and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior \nmanagers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in \ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys \nrepresenting victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts \nwith the USAO and the FBI.   \nOPR  identified  former  U.S.  Attorney  Acosta,  three  former  USAO  supervisors,  and  the  \nAUSA  as  subjects  of  its  investigation  based  on  preliminary  information  indicating  that  each  of  \nthem  was  involved  in  the  decision  to  resolve  the  case  through  the  NPA  or  in  the  negotiations  \nleading to the agreement.  OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of \nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result \nin a finding of professional misconduct.  OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta \nand another subject.  All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation.  OPR requested \nthat  all  of  the  subjects  provide  written  responses  detailing  their  involvement  in  the  federal  \ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim \nnotification  and  consultation.    OPR  received  and  reviewed  written  responses  from  all  of  the  \nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before \na  court  reporter.    Each  subject  was  represented  by  counsel  and  had  access  to  relevant  \ncontemporaneous  documents  before  the  subject’s  OPR  interview.    The  subjects  reviewed  and  \nprovided  comments  on  their  respective  interview  transcripts  and  on  OPR’s  draft  report.    OPR  \n                                                 \n6\n    The  federal  government  was  closed  from  December  22,  2018,  to  January  25,  2019.    After  initiating  its  \ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the \nstatus of the OPR investigation. \n\nvii \n \ncarefully  considered  the  comments  and  made  changes,  or  noted  comments,  as  OPR  deemed  \nappropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions.      \nFinally,  OPR  reviewed  relevant  case  law,  statutes,  regulations,  Department  policy,  and  \nattorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case \nand to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. \nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the \nfederal  investigators  and  prosecutors,  but  because  OPR  does  not  have  jurisdiction  over  state  \nofficials,  OPR  did  not  investigate,  or  reach  conclusions  about,  their  conduct  regarding  the  state  \ninvestigation.\n7\n    Because  OPR’s  mission  is  to  ensure  that  Department  attorneys  adhere  to  the  \nstandards  of  professional  conduct,  OPR’s  investigation  focused  on  the  actions  of  the  subject  \nattorneys  rather  than  on  determining  the  full  scope  of  Epstein’s  and  his  assistants’  criminal  \nbehavior.  Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his \nassistants’  conduct  as  it  was  known  to  the  subjects  at  the  time  they  performed  their  duties  as  \nDepartment attorneys.  Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, \nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to \nthat  date,  and  OPR  did  not  evaluate  the  subjects’  conduct  on  the  basis  of  that  subsequent  \ninformation.   \nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events \nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.  As a result, \nmany  of  the  subjects  and  witnesses  were  unable  to  recall  the  details  of  events  or  their  own  or  \nothers’  actions  occurring  in  2006-2008,  such  as  conversations,  meetings,  or  documents  they  \nreviewed at the time.\n8\n  However, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly \nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the \ngovernment  and  defense  counsel.    These  records  often  referred  to  the  interactions  among  the  \nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.      \nIII. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK \n  OPR’s  primary  mission  is  to  ensure  that  Department  attorneys  perform  their  duties  in  \naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal \nlaw enforcement agency.  Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct \nagainst  current  or  former  Department  attorneys  related  to  the  exercise  of  their  authority  to  \n                                                 \n7\n  In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of \nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.  As reported, the \ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.   \n8\n  OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution \nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019.  Moreover, as the line prosecutor in \nthe  Epstein  investigation  and  also  as  co-counsel  in  the  CVRA  litigation  until  the  USAO  was  recused  from  that  \nlitigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions \nto review these materials in the course of her official duties.  Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a written \nresponse,  and  in  preparing  to  be  interviewed  by  OPR,  the  AUSA  was  able  to  refresh  her  recollection  with  these  \nmaterials  to  an  extent  not  possible  for  the  other  subjects,  who  were  provided  with  relevant  documents  by  OPR  in  \npreparation for their interviews.  \n\nviii \n \ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.\n9 \n   OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations \nof  misconduct  against  Department  law  enforcement  agents  when  they  relate  to  a  Department  \nattorney’s alleged professional misconduct.   \nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs \nthe  challenged  conduct  and  whether  a  subject  attorney  violated  that  standard.    Department  \nattorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of \ntheir  duties,  including  the  Constitution,  statutes,  standards  of  conduct  imposed  by  attorney  \nlicensing  authorities,  and  Department  regulations  and  policies.    OPR  finds  misconduct  when  it  \nconcludes  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  a  subject  attorney  violated  such  a  standard  \nintentionally or recklessly.  Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that \n(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not \nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the \nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct.  In some cases, OPR may conclude \nthat  a  subject  attorney’s  conduct  does  not  satisfy  the  elements  necessary  for  a  professional  \nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding.  In such cases, OPR may \nconclude  that  a  subject  attorney  exercised  poor  judgment,  made  a  mistake,  or  otherwise  acted  \ninappropriately  under  the  circumstances.    OPR  may  also  determine  that  the  subject  attorney’s  \nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances.\n10\n   \nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED \n In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations.  The first relates to \nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA.  The second relates to the USAO’s \ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA.  The two sets \nof issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. \nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA \n  In  evaluating  whether  any  of  the  subjects  committed  professional  misconduct,  OPR  \nconsidered  whether  any  of  the  NPA’s  provisions  violated  a  clear  or  unambiguous  statute,  \nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy.  In particular, OPR \nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination \nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants \n                                                 \n9\n  28 C.F.R. § 0.39a(a)(1).  OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring \nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during \nOPR’s  investigation.    Over  its  45-year  history,  OPR  has  routinely  investigated  the  conduct  of  former  Department  \nattorneys.  Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that \na former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an \nappropriate state attorney disciplinary authority.  Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct \nof Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.   \n10\n  In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after \na  preliminary  inquiry  into  the  matter.    In  December  2010,  one  of  the  attorneys  representing  victims  in  the  CVRA  \nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation \nand  that  the  USAO  had  deceived  the  victims  of  Epstein’s  crimes  about  the  existence  of  the  NPA.    Pursuant  to  its  \nstandard  policy,  OPR  declined  to  open  an  investigation  into  those  allegations  at  that  time  in  deference  to  the  \nthen-pending CVRA litigation.   \n\nix \n \nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens.  The potentially applicable standards that \nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report.  OPR \nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter \ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, \nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism.  OPR also examined and \ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed \nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation. \nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA \n To address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, \nand  timing  of  the  government’s  interactions  with  victims  both  before  and  after  the  NPA  was  \nsigned,  including  victim  notification  letters  issued  by  the  USAO  and  the  FBI  and  interviews  \nconducted by the USAO.  OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear \nand  unambiguous  standard  governing  victim  consultation  or  notification.    OPR  examined  the  \ngovernment’s  lack  of  consultation  with  the  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed,  as  well  as  the  \ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s \nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. \nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS \nOPR  evaluated  the  conduct  of  each  subject  and  considered  his  or  her  individual  role  in  \nvarious decisions and events.  Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal \ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of \nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led \nto the NPA.  Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved \nit, with knowledge of its terms.  During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved \nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it.  Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for \nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions.  Acosta’s overall \nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less \nclear,  but  Acosta  affirmatively  made  certain  decisions  regarding  victim  notification,  and  OPR  \nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.  \nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA \nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects \ndid  not  commit  professional  misconduct  with  respect  to  the  development,  negotiation,  and  \napproval of the NPA.  Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a \nsubject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing \nthe conduct at issue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict \nEpstein  on  federal  charges  or  that  prohibited  his  decision  to  defer  prosecution  to  the  state.    \nFurthermore,  none  of  the  individual  terms  of  the  NPA  violated  Department  or  other  applicable  \nstandards.  \nAs the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and \nDepartment  policy  to  resolve  the  case  as  he  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate,  as  long  as  his  \ndecision  was  not  motivated  or  influenced  by  improper  factors.    Acosta’s  decision  to  decline  to  \n\nx \n \ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not \nfind  evidence  that  his  decision  was  based  on  corruption  or  other  impermissible  considerations,  \nsuch  as  Epstein’s  wealth,  status,  or  associations.    Evidence  shows  that  Acosta  resisted  defense  \nefforts  to  have  the  matter  returned  to  the  state  for  whatever  result  state  authorities  deemed  \nappropriate,  and  he  refused  to  eliminate  the  incarceration  and  sexual  offender  registration  \nrequirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one \nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, \nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show \nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on \nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper \nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a \nstate-based  resolution.    Accordingly,  OPR  does  not  find  that  Acosta  engaged  in  professional  \nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other \nsubjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   \nNevertheless,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta’s  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  investigation  \nthrough  the  NPA  constitutes  poor  judgment.    Although  this  decision  was  within  the  scope  of  \nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA \nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its \ninvestigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein \nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should \nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state \nauthorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties \ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had \nno  authority;  he  resolved  the  federal  investigation  before  significant  investigative  steps  were  \ncompleted;  and  he  agreed  to  several  unusual  and  problematic  terms  in  the  NPA  without  the  \nconsideration  required  under  the  circumstances.    In  sum,  Acosta’s  application  of  federalism  \nprinciples  was  too  expansive,  his  view  of  the  federal  interest  in  prosecuting  Epstein  was  too  \nnarrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use \nthe NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the \nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other \njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination \nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a \nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     \nB. Findings  and  Conclusions  Relating  to  the  Government’s  Interactions  with  \nVictims  \nOPR  further  concludes  that  none  of  the  subject  attorneys  committed  professional  \nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims.  The subjects did not have \na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the \nNPA   because   the   USAO   resolved   the   Epstein   investigation   without   a   federal   criminal   \ncharge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA \nrights  to  attach  unless  and  until  federal  charges  had  been  filed,  and  the  federal  courts  had  not  \nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were \nbrought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose \nof  silencing  victims.    Nonetheless,  the  lack  of  consultation  was  part  of  a  series  of  government  \n\nxi \n \ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s \ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the \nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.  \n  OPR  determined  that  none  of  the  subjects  was  responsible  for  communications  sent  to  \ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that \nfailed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who \nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the \nFBI  when  communicating  with  victims,  and  were  not  drafted  or  reviewed  by  the  subjects.    \nMoreover,  the  statement  that  the  matter  was  “under  investigation”  was  not  false  because  the  \ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill \nthe terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim \nfrustration  and  confusion  by  failing  to  provide  important  information  about  the  status  of  the  \ninvestigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies \nresponsible  for  communicating  with  Epstein’s  victims  and  showed  a  lack  of  attention  to  and  \noversight regarding communication with victims.     \nAfter  the  NPA  was  signed,  Acosta  elected  to  defer  to  the  State  Attorney  the  decision  \nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights \nrequirements.    Although  Acosta’s  decision  was  within  his  authority  and  did  not  constitute  \nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to \nmake  certain  that  the  state  intended  to  and  would  notify  victims  identified  through  the  federal  \ninvestigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important \nproceeding  that  resolved  the  federal  investigation,  an  investigation  about  which  the  USAO  had  \ncommunicated  with  victims  for  months.    It  also  ultimately  created  the  misimpression  that  the  \nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were \nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure \nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  \nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA \nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and \nconversations  with  victims’  attorneys  in  2008  do  not  constitute  professional  misconduct.    \nContemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating \nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, \nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing \nvictims.    Nonetheless,  the  failure  to  reevaluate  the  strategy  prior  to  interviews  of  victims  and  \ndiscussions  with  victims’  attorneys  occurring  in  2008  led  to  interactions  that  contributed  to  \nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      \nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, \nOPR  concludes  that  the  government’s  lack  of  transparency  and  its  inconsistent  messages  led  to  \nvictims  feeling  confused  and  ill-treated  by  the  government;  gave  victims  and  the  public  the  \nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret \nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The \noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims \nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes \n\nxii \n \nthat  the  victims  were  not  treated  with  the  forthrightness  and  sensitivity  expected  by  the  \nDepartment.   \nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT \n The  Report  is  divided  into  three  chapters.    In  Chapter  One,  OPR  describes  the  relevant  \nfederal,  state,  and  local  law  enforcement  entities  involved  in  investigating  Epstein’s  criminal  \nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.  \nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with \nthe subjects.     \nIn  Chapter  Two,  OPR  sets  forth  an  extensive  account  of  events  relating  to  the  federal  \ninvestigation of Epstein.  The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young \nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law \nenforcement   authorities—and   continues   through   the   mid-2006   opening   of   the   federal   \ninvestigation;  the  September  2007  negotiation  and  signing  of  the  NPA;  Epstein’s  subsequent  \nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2008 \nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with \nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July \n2010.  After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations \nrelating  to  the  decisions  made  regarding  the  development  and  execution  of  the  NPA.    OPR  \ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’ \nconduct.  \nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s \nfindings  regarding  the  CVRA.    OPR  describes  the  relevant  events  and  analyzes  the  subjects’  \nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.    \nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including \ninternal  USAO  and  Department  communications,  because  doing  so  is  necessary  for  a  full  \nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.   \n\nxiii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ............................................................................................................. i \nI.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES \nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District \nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nThe  Department  of  Justice  (Department)  is  a  cabinet-level  executive  branch  department  \nheaded by the United States Attorney General.  The stated mission of the Department is to enforce \nfederal  law  and  defend  the  interests  of  the  United  States;  ensure  public  safety;  provide  federal  \nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful \nbehavior;  and  ensure  the  fair  and  impartial  administration  of  justice.    The  Department  enforces  \nfederal  criminal  law  through  investigations  and  prosecutions  of  violations  of  federal  criminal  \nstatutes.    It  also  engages  in  civil  litigation.    During  the  period  relevant  to  this  Report,  the  \nDepartment  had  approximately  110,000  employees  in  40  components.    The  Department’s  \nheadquarters  are  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and  it  conducts  most  of  its  work  through  field  locations  \naround the nation and overseas. \nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Attorney’s \nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate) \nU.S. Attorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Attorney \nGeneral through the Deputy Attorney General.\n1\n  The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by \nan Assistant Attorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also \nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Attorney’s Offices, and provide legal \nexpertise  and  policy  guidance.    Among  the  Criminal  Division  components  mentioned  in  this  \nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and \nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section \n(CEOS). \nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises attorneys and investigators who specialize \nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology, \nand  they  assist  U.S.  Attorney’s  Offices  in  investigations,  trials,  and  appeals  related  to  these  \noffenses.  CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel, \nand  government  officials.  CEOS  also  works  to  develop  and  refine  proposals  for  prosecution  \npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.  \n  The U.S. Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2018 and renamed the Justice Manual) \nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department \nemployees.  It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division \n                                                 \n1\n    Two  U.S.  Attorney’s  Offices,  in  the  judicial  districts  of  Guam  and  of  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands,  are  \nheaded by a single U.S. Attorney.  The Attorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting \nand interim U.S. Attorneys.   \n\n \n2 \n \nor other divisions having responsibility for specific criminal enforcement, such as the Civil Rights \nDivision.  In this Report, OPR applies the USAM provisions in effect at the relevant time.     \nDuring  the  period  most  relevant  to  this  Report,  the  Attorney  General  was  Michael  \nMukasey, the Deputy Attorney General was Mark Filip, and the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Criminal Division was Alice Fisher.  The Chief of CEOS was Andrew Oosterbaan.    \n The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO) handles federal \nmatters in the Southern District of Florida judicial district, which covers the counties of Miami-\nDade,  Broward,  Monroe,  Palm  Beach,  Martin,  St.  Lucie,  Indian  River,  Okeechobee,  and  \nHighlands,  an  area  of  over  15,000  square  miles.    During  the  period  relevant  to  this  Report,  the  \nUSAO  had  a  staff  of  approximately  200  Assistant  U.S.  Attorneys  (AUSAs)  and  200  support  \npersonnel.    The  main  office  is  in  Miami;  staffed  branch  offices  are  located  in  Fort  Lauderdale,  \nWest Palm Beach (covering Palm Beach County), and Fort Pierce; and an unstaffed branch office \nis located in Key West.  The West Palm Beach USAO office is approximately 70 miles from the \nMiami  office.    The  USAO  is  headed  by  the  U.S.  Attorney;  the  second-in-command  is  the  First  \nAssistant  U.S.  Attorney  (FAUSA),  who  serves  as  principal  advisor  to  the  U.S.  Attorney  and  \nsupervises all components of the USAO, including the Criminal, Civil, and Appellate Divisions, \neach  of  which  is  headed  by  a  Chief.    During  the  period  relevant  to  this  Report,  the  West  Palm  \nBeach office consisted of two criminal sections and was headed by a Managing AUSA.    \n The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the principal federal law enforcement agency \nand is part of the Department.  It maintains field offices that work with U.S. Attorney’s Offices.  \nThe FBI field office in Miami, headed by a Special Agent in Charge, has satellite offices, known \nas Resident Agencies, one of which is located in West Palm Beach and covers Palm Beach County.  \nThe Epstein investigation was handled by Special Agents assigned to a particular West Palm Beach \nResident Agency squad, headed by a Supervisory Special Agent.  FBI responsibility for advising \ncrime  victims  of  their  rights  and  of  victim  services  available  to  them  is  handled  by  non-agent  \nVictim Specialists. \n  The  following  chart  shows  the  Department’s  organizational  structure  during  the  period  \nrelevant to this Report: \n  \n\nI \n~ \nSOLIOTOR \nGENERAL \nSOL10T\n1 \nGEN \nI \nl \nOFFICE \nOF \nTH£ \nSOLICITOR \nGENERAL \nOFFICE \nSOLIC\nI \nGEN \nOF\nF\nICE \nOF \nJUSTI\nCE \nPROG\nRA\nMS \nOFfl, \nJUSTJ\n, \nPROG\ni \nEXEWTI\nVE \nO\"ICE \nFOil \nTHE \nUNITED \nSTATB \nEXEWTI\n1 \nO\"ICEF \nUNITED \nOFFICE \nOF \nDISPUTE \nRESOLUTION \nOFH \nDISP\nI \nRESOLI \nASSOCIATE \nATTORNEY \nG\nENERAL \nC\nOMMUNITY \nOI\nIIENTED \nCIVIL \nRIGKTS \n--\nDMSION \nPOUONG \nSBIVICfi \nO\nFFI\nCE OF \nANTITRUST \n--\nINFORMA\nTION \nDMSION \nAND \nPR\nIVACY \nFOREIG\nN \nCl.A\nI\nMS \n--\nSETTl.EMENT \nTAX \nDIV\nIS I\nON \nCOMMJSSION \nOff'\nICEOf \nVIOLE\nNCE \nAGA\nI\nNST \nWOMEN \n--\nCIVIL \nDIVIS\nION \nEHVIRONMEHT \n--\nAND \nNATlJRAL \nRfSOURCfi \nDIVISION \nCOMMUNITY \n--\nRELAT\nIONS \nSERVIC\nE \nU.S. \nDepartment \nof \nJustice \n2006-\n2008 \nAttorn\ney \nGeneral \nDep\nu\nty \nAttorney \nGeneral \nOFFICE \nOF \nOFFIC\nE \nOF \nLEGA\nL \nPOLICY \n..... \nPUBLIC \nAFFAIRS \nOFFICE \nOF \nOFFICE \nOF \nLE\nGISLATIVE \n--\nLEGAL \nA\nFFA\nIRS \nCOUNSE\nL \nOff'ICE \nOF I\nNTl'R\n• \nGOVERNMENTAL \nAN\nD \nPUBLIC \nUASON \n3 \nR:DfRAL \n--\nCRIMINAL \nIIUUAUOI' \nIN\\lfSTlGATlON \nDIVISION \nDRUG \nBUREAU \nOF \ntNFCRClMENT \n--\nAOMlfflS\nT\nRATION \nPRISONS \nEXEQITlVE \nUNI\nTfD \nSTATB \nOl'RCEFOR \n--\nU\nNIT\nED \nSTATl'S \nMARSHALS \nSERVICE \nATTOII\nNEYS \nUNITED \nU.S.NATIONAL \nSTATES \n--\nCENTIIAL \nBUREAU \nA\nTT\nO\nRNEYS \nINT1'RPOI. \nIUIIIA\nU OF \nOf\nFKEOl'\nTHE \nAl.<Oo<OI., \n--\nFEDERAL \nToeACCO\n, \nFIREARMS\n~ & \nD\nETENTION \nEXPLOSIVES \nTRUSTEE \nNA\nTI\nONAL \nSECURITY \n--\nDIVISION \nOFFICE \nOF \nTH\nE \nINSPECTOR \n--\nGENERAL \nJUSTICE \nMANAGEMENT \n--\nDIVISION \nEXE\nCUT\nI\nVE \nO\"IOEFOR \n--\nIMIVIGRATION \nREV\nI\nEW \nO\"ICEOf \nPRORSSIONAL \nRfSPONSlBIUTY \n\"ICEOf \nRSSIONAL \nRfSPONSlBIUTY \nOFFlCE \nOFTHE \nPARDON \nATTORNEY \nCE \nOFTHE \n'ARDON \nHO\nRNEY \nUNITED \nSTATE'S \nPAROl£ \nODMMISSION \nITEDSTATE'S \nPAROl£ \nODMMISSION \nN\nATIONAL \nDRUG \nlN\nTELUGENCf \nCENTER \nONALD\nR\nUG \nRLIGENCE \nENTER \nPRORSS\nIONAL \nRfSPONSlBIUTY \nADVISORY \nOl'RCE \n\n \n4 \n \nB. The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies \nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Attorney \nin each of the state’s 20 judicial circuits, headed by a State Attorney who is elected to a four-year \nterm.  Palm Beach County constitutes the 15th Judicial Circuit.  Barry Krischer was the elected \nState Attorney for that circuit from 1992 until January 2009.  During the period relevant to this \nReport, the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach, \nhad more than 100 attorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed \nby Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.     \nThe incorporated Town of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of \nWest  Palm  Beach.    Its  law  enforcement  agency  is  the  Palm  Beach  Police  Department  (PBPD).    \nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in 1981, served as PBPD Chief from 2001 to February 2009. \nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is \nthe  largest  law  enforcement  agency  in  the  county.    Through  its  Department  of  Corrections,  the  \nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed \nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility.  The current \nSheriff has served continuously since January 2005. \nII. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE \n R.  Alexander  Acosta  was  appointed  Interim  U.S.  Attorney  for  the  Southern  District  of  \nFlorida  in  June  2005,  at  age  36.    In  June  2006,  President  George  W.  Bush  formally  nominated  \nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney in October 2006.   \nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an 18-month \nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years \nas a policy fellow and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division.  He was presidentially appointed in 2002 as a \nmember  of  the  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  and  in  2003  as  Assistant  Attorney  General  in  \ncharge  of  the  Department’s  Civil  Rights  Division,  where  he  served  from  August  2003  until  his  \nappointment as Interim U.S. Attorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution \nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta’s office was in the \nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.   \nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Attorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of \nEpstein,  engaged  in  plea  discussions  with  Epstein’s  counsel,  and  negotiated  the  federal  non-\nprosecution  agreement  (NPA)  that  is  the  subject  of  this  Report.    Acosta  made  the  decision  to  \nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allowing Epstein to enter a state plea.  \nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations \nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO.  Acosta continued to \nprovide  supervisory  oversight  and  to  have  meetings  and  other  communications  with  Epstein’s  \nattorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007, \nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 30, \n2008.  On December 8, 2008, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state \nprison  sentence,  Acosta  was  formally  recused  from  all  matters  involving  the  law  firm  of  \n\n \n5 \n \nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the \nfirm about possible employment.    \nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2009, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International \nUniversity  College  of  Law.    In  April  2017,  Acosta  became  the  U.S.  Secretary  of  Labor,  but  he  \nresigned from that post effective July 19, 2019, following public criticism of the USAO’s handling \nof the Epstein case.   \n Jeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in 1990 as a line AUSA.  In 2001, he became Deputy \nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in \n2003, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office.  In early 2004, Sloman was appointed \nChief  of  the  USAO’s  Criminal  Division.    In  October  2006,  Sloman  became  the  FAUSA,  and  \nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.   \n  As  FAUSA,  Sloman  was  responsible  for  supervising  the  Civil,  Criminal,  and  Appellate  \nDivisions,  and  he  was  part  of  the  supervisory  team  that  oversaw  the  Epstein  investigation.    \nAlthough Sloman had relatively little involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the \nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA, \nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2007.  After subordinates Matthew Menchel \nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafaña, \non Epstein matters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.  \nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein matter in December 2008, Sloman became \nthe senior USAO official supervising the matter.  When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became \nthe Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2010, the Attorney \nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Attorney for the district.  Sloman left the USAO \nto enter private practice in June 2010. \n Matthew I. Menchel joined the USAO in 1998 after having served as a New York County \n(Manhattan) Assistant District Attorney for 11 years.  After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel \nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section.  In October 2006, Menchel became the Chief \nof  the  USAO’s  Criminal  Division,  based  in  Miami.    As  Criminal  Division  Chief,  Menchel  was  \npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings \nand other communications with defense counsel.  Menchel participated in the decision to extend a \ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense.  Shortly after \nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2007, and before the precise terms of the \nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.   \n Andrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in 1994, after having served for three \nyears  as  an  AUSA  in  New  Jersey.    During  his  13-year  tenure  at  the  USAO,  Lourie  served  two  \nterms  on  detail  as  the  Acting  Chief  of  the  Department’s  Criminal  Division’s  Public  Integrity  \nSection, first from September 2001 until September 2002, and then from February 2006 until July \n2006.  Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2006, Lourie was \na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West \nPalm  Beach  branch  office.    Lourie  was  part  of  the  supervisory  team  that  oversaw  the  Epstein  \ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with \ndefense  counsel.    During  September  2007,  while  the  NPA  was  being  negotiated,  Lourie  \ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant \nAttorney  General  Alice  Fisher.    Lourie  left  the  Department  in  February  2008  to  enter  private  \npractice.  \n Ann Marie C. Villafaña joined the USAO in September 2001 as a line AUSA.  She served \nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2004, when she transferred to the West Palm \nBeach branch office.  Villafaña handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm \nBeach,  along  with  other  criminal  matters.    In  2006,  she  was  designated  as  the  USAO’s  first  \ncoordinator  for  Project  Safe  Childhood,  a  new  Department  initiative  focusing  on  child  sexual  \nexploitation and abuse.\n2\n   \nIn 2006, Villafaña assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation.  As the line AUSA, \nVillafaña  handled  all  aspects  of  the  investigation.    Villafaña  determined  the  lines  of  inquiry  to  \npursue,  identified  the  witnesses  to  be  interviewed,  conducted  legal  research  to  support  possible  \ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department.  Villafaña, along \nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.  \nShe   handled   court   proceedings   related   to   the   investigation.      She   drafted   a   prosecution   \nmemorandum,  indictment,  and  related  documents,  and  revised  those  documents  in  response  to  \ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command.  Villafaña participated in meetings \nbetween  members  of  the  USAO  and  counsel  for  Epstein,  and  prepared  briefing  materials  for  \nmanagement  in  preparation  for  those  meetings  and  in  response  to  issues  raised  during  those  \nmeetings.  Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve \nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafaña was the primary USAO \nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her \nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.  Thereafter, \nVillafaña  monitored  Epstein’s  compliance  with  the  NPA  and  addressed  issues  relating  to  his  \nconduct.    After  two  victims  pursued  a  federal  civil  lawsuit  seeking  enforcement  of  their  rights  \nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (“the CVRA litigation” or “the \nCVRA case”), in July 2008, Villafaña served as co-counsel to the lead attorney representing the \nUSAO until February 2019, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.\n3\n  Villafaña \nleft the USAO in August 2019 to join another federal government agency.  \n \nThe  following  chart  shows  the  USAO  positions  filled  by  the  subjects,  or  other  USAO  \npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n                                                 \n2\n  Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2006 to combat the \ngrowing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS \nA. Jeffrey Epstein \nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953.\n4\n  Although he did not graduate \nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhattan \nfrom 1974 until 1976.  Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street \nfirm  of  Bear  Stearns,  where  he  rose  from  junior  assistant  to  a  floor  trader  to  become  a  limited  \npartner before leaving in 1981.  An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear, \nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur \nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtown Manhattan, where he resided.  In the early \n1990s, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida.  He also owned a private island \nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France.  He traveled \namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.   \nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other \nentities, in numerous locations.  Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and \nextent  of  his  wealth  were  never  publicly  established  during  his  lifetime.\n5\n    He  associated  with  \nprominent  and  wealthy  individuals  from  business,  political,  academic,  and  social  circles,  and  \nengaged  in  substantial  philanthropy.    Epstein  maintained  a  large  corps  of  employees,  including  \nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom \ntraveled with him.    \nB. Epstein’s Defense Attorneys \nJeffrey  Epstein  employed  numerous  criminal  defense  attorneys  in  responding  to  the  \nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach, \nFlorida  estate.    As  different  law  enforcement  entities  became  involved  in  investigating  the  \nallegations, he added attorneys having particular relevant knowledge of, or connections with, those \nentities.    At  the  outset  of  the  state  investigation,  Epstein  retained  nationally  prominent  Miami  \ncriminal trial attorney Roy Black.  He was also represented by a local criminal defense attorney \nwho  was  a  former  Palm  Beach  County  Assistant  State  Attorney,  and  by  nationally  prominent  \nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein.  After initial plea negotiations with the State Attorney’s Office, \nEpstein replaced the local attorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal \ndefense  attorney  whose  law  partner  was  married  to  the  Assistant  State  Attorney  handling  the  \nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Attorney was removed from the \nEpstein  case  on  the  basis  of  that  conflict  of  interest.    Another  prominent  attorney  who  began  \nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City attorney Gerald Lefcourt, \n                                                 \n4\n  Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.  See, e.g., Landon Thomas \nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2002; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr. \nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2003; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and \nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2019;\n Lisette Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Façade Finally Cracks,” \nForbes, July 12, 2019.  \n5\n  After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and \ntrust documents.  https://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.    \n\n \n9 \n \nwhose law firm website cites his “national reputation for the aggressive defense” of “high-profile \ndefendants in criminal matters.”      \nIn  late  2006,  after  the  USAO  opened  its  investigation,  Epstein  hired  Miami  criminal  \ndefense  attorneys  who  were  former  AUSAs.    One,  Guy  Lewis,  had  also  served  as  the  U.S.  \nAttorney for the Southern District of Florida and as Director of the Department’s Executive Office \nfor  United  States  Attorneys,  the  component  charged  with  providing  close  liaison  between  the  \nDepartment and the U.S. Attorneys.  Another, Lilly Ann Sanchez, had served in the USAO and \nas  a  Deputy  Chief  in  the  Major  Crimes  Section  before  leaving  in  2005.    In  August  2007,  \nimmediately after the USAO offered the terms that ultimately led to the NPA, two attorneys from \nthe firm of Kirkland & Ellis, one of the largest law firms in the country, contacted the USAO on \nEpstein’s behalf:  Kenneth Starr, former federal judge and Solicitor General, who was serving as \nDean of Pepperdine University School of Law while of counsel to the firm; and Jay Lefkowitz, a \nlitigation  partner  who  had  served  in  high-level  positions  in  the  administrations  of  Presidents  \nGeorge  H.W.  Bush  and  George  W.  Bush.    They  were  joined  by  nationally  prominent  Boston  \ncriminal defense attorney Martin Weinberg.  After the NPA was signed, former U.S. Attorney \nJoe D. Whitley joined the defense team, as did the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS and \nanother former U.S. Attorney, who was also a retired federal judge. \n  \n\n \n10 \n \n[Page Intentionally Left Blank]  \n\n \n11 \n \nCHAPTER TWO \nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT  \nPART ONE:  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nI. OVERVIEW \nIn the following sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) \ndetails  the  significant  events  leading  to,  and  during,  the  federal  investigation  of  Epstein;  the  \nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the \nNPA from taking effect.  OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled \nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement.  In describing \nevents,  OPR  relies  heavily  on  contemporaneous  documents,  particularly  emails.    In  many  \ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the \nissues  under  discussion,  the  alternatives  considered,  and  the  basis  for  certain  decisions.    When  \nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations \nas  provided  in  their  written  responses  to,  or  interviews  with,  OPR,  or  explanations  provided  by  \nwitnesses. \nA timeline of key events is set forth on the following page. \nII. MARCH  2005  –  MAY  2006:    EPSTEIN  IS  INVESTIGATED  BY  THE  PALM  \nBEACH  POLICE  DEPARTMENT  AND  THE  PALM  BEACH  COUNTY  STATE  \nATTORNEY’S OFFICE \nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation \nIn March 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid \ntheir  daughter  $300  to  give  him  a  massage  in  his  Palm  Beach  home.\n6\n    The  PBPD  began  \ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants, \nwho were also implicated by the complainant.  The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial \nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2004 and 2005, Epstein, through his female assistants   \n                                                 \n6\n  As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of 18.  Epstein’s contacts with girls and young \nwomen previously had come to the attention of the PBPD.  In March 2004, a PBPD officer documented a telephone \ncomplaint  that  a  17-year-old  girl  had  been  giving  Epstein  topless  massages  at  his  residence  for  several  months  for  \n$200 per massage.  The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered \nto  cooperate  with  a  police  investigation.    The  PBPD  report  relating  to  this  complaint  described  the  information  as  \n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.     \nOn November 28, 2004, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed \ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence.  The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the \nPBPD  did  not  have  evidence  that  the  women  seen  entering  Epstein’s  home  were  minors,  and  typically  did  not  \ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the matter.   \n\n12 \nTimeline \nof \nKey \nEvents \nfor \nFederal \nEpstein \nInvestigation \n-\nMay \n2006 \nthrough \nOctober \n2008 \nMay~\n.,  -  V1llafaiia \nope\nns \nfedera\nl mwsugat10\nn into \nJeffrey \nEpste\nin \n■ \nJu ly \n14 \n-  \\'1\n1l\nataiia \nfirst \nbnefi\nng to \nAcosta \nand \nSloman \n■■ \n2006 \nOct \n~ \n-\nS loman becomes \nFirst \nAssistant \nL:mted \nStates \nA\ntt\norney: \nMenchcl \nbecomes \nC runm\nal Chief \n-\n~ \n-\n~ \n-\n. \n~ \n-\n~ \n-\nJune \n26 \n-  Sloman, \nMencbel, \nLourie, \nVillafaila, \nand \nFBI \nmeet \nwith \nEpstein's \ncounsel \nJuly \n26 \n-\nV11lafat1a \nlearns \nfrom \nMenchel \nthat \nAcosta \ndecided \nto \noffer \nEpstein \na \ntwo-year \nstate-based \nresolution \nJuly \n31 \n-  Sloman, \nMenchel, \nLourie\n, \nVillafada. \nand \nFBI \nagents \nmeet \nwith \nEpstein's \ncounsel \nto \npropose \ntwo-year \nstale-based \nresoluuon \nSept \n7 -\nAcosta. \nSloman, \nVillafaful \n[+others] \nmeet \nwith \nEpstein's \ncounsel \nSept \n12 \n-\nLourie\n, Villafana \n(+others) \nmeet \nwith \nEpstein's \ncounsel \nand \nthe \nState \nAttorney's \nOffice \nto \ndiscuss \nstate-based \nresolution \nSept \n24 \n-  NPA \nis \nsigned. \nLourie \nleaves \nUSAO \nfor \nposition \nin \nDOJ \nCrinunal \nDivision \nOtt \nNo,· \nOtt \nJan \nFrb \n\\tlr \nApr \nFeb \n25-29 \n-  OOJ \nCrurunal \nO1vmon1CEOS \nbegins \nreview \n).fay \n15 \n-  Criminal \nDivision \nletter \nto \nEpstein's \ncounsel \nsupporting \nfederal \nEpstein \nprosecution \nMay \n19 \n-  F.pstein \n·s \ncounsel \nsends \nletter \nlo \nDeputy \nAttorney \nGeneral's \nOffice \nrequesting \nreview \nJune \n23 \n-  Deputy \nAttorney \nGeneral's \nOtlice \nsends \nletter \nto \nEpstein's \ncounsel \ndee \nI \nining \n10 \nintervene \n•••• \n\n \n13 \n \nand  some  of  the  victims  as  well,  regularly  recruited  local  high-school-age  girls  to  give  him  \nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n \n   \nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.  \nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him.  The \nnature of the massages varied.  According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they \nmassaged  Epstein,  some  wore  only  their  underwear,  and  some  were  fully  nude.    Victims  stated  \nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself.  Some victims alleged that he touched \nthem  during  the  massage,  usually  fondling  their  breasts  or  touching  their  vaginas  directly  or  \nthrough their clothing.  Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and \nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them.  Some victims who stated that they saw him more \noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them.  According to one victim, an \nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at \nEpstein’s direction.\n7\n   \nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent \nin describing a general pattern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants.  According to \nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled \nup  to  three  massage  appointments  each  day,  often  contacting  the  girls  to  make  an  appointment  \nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences.  Typically, when a girl \narrived  at  Epstein’s  home  for  a  massage,  she  was  taken  upstairs  to  the  master  bedroom  and  \nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils.  When \nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a towel.  After removing his \nclothing, Epstein lay face down and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her \nclothing,  and  then  explained  to  her  how  he  wished  her  to  perform  the  massage.    During  the  \nmassage,  Epstein  masturbated  himself,  often  while  fondling  the  girl  performing  the  massage.    \nWhen  Epstein  climaxed,  the  massage  was  over.    Usually,  Epstein  paid  the  girl  $200  for  the  \nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact \nher in the future.  Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls \ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to \nperform  a  massage,  each  girl  would  receive  $200.    Several  of  the  victims  acknowledged  to  the  \nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.   \nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knowledge of the girls’ ages was mixed.  Some girls who \nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were \nover 18 years old.  However, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages. \nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flowers to her at her high school \nafter she performed in a school play.  In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some \nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.    \nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning.  He retained local \ncriminal  defense  counsel,  who  in  turn  hired  private  investigators.    In  October  2005,  the  PBPD,  \nwith  the  assistance  of  the  State  Attorney’s  Office,  obtained  a  search  warrant  for  Epstein’s  \nresidence.  When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 20, 2005, to execute the warrant, \n                                                 \n7\n  According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than \nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.  \n\n \n14 \n \nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance \ncameras,  but  the  computer  equipment  itself—including  video  recordings  and  other  electronic  \nstorage media—were gone.  Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home, \nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants  documented  messages  from  many  girls  over  a  \ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments.  The police also found numerous \nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age.  Police photographs taken of the interior \nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and \nmaster bedroom and bathroom area.  The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s \nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.  \nB. The State Attorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury \nState Attorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that \npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest.  Krischer was unfamiliar with \nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit.  PBPD Chief Michael \nReiter stated in a 2009 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State \nAttorney’s Office in 2005, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go \nfor  it,”  because,  given  the  nature  of  the  allegations,  Epstein  was  “somebody  we  have  to  stop.”    \nKrischer told OPR, however, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that \n“there were witness problems.”   \nAssistant State Attorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told \nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Attorney who initially worked with her on the \ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”  \nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the \nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed, \nunlawful  sexual  activity  with  a  minor  (Florida  Statute  §  794.05(1))  and  lewd  and  lascivious  \nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 800.04(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”\n8\n  \nIn  addition,  victims  had  given  contradictory  statements  to  police,  and  the  original  complainant,  \nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation \nof sexual contact.  Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of \nprobation, which he rejected.\n9\n \nRecords  publicly  released  by  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  show  that,  beginning  in  early  \n2006, attorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allow Epstein to plead “no \ncontest” rather than guilty.  To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and \npresented the State Attorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of \nthe  victims’  credibility,  including  criminal  records,  victims’  social  media  postings  (such  as  \nMySpace pages) about their own sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared \nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knowledge of victims’ ages.  Krischer \n                                                 \n8\n    Belohlavek  stated  that  she  did  not  consider  charging  procurement  of  a  minor  for  prostitution—the  charge  \nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.   \n9\n  In April 2006, the State Attorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree \nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation \nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.     \n\n \n15 \n \ntold OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought attorney Alan Dershowitz to see Krischer and the \nAssistant State Attorney, but Dershowitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going \nto destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.”  According \nto  Krischer,  Dershowitz  so  “tainted  the  waters”  that  Epstein  also  hired  local  attorney  Jack  \nGoldberger,  with  whom  Krischer  had  “a  working  relationship.”    Because  the  husband  of  the  \nAssistant  State  Attorney  was  Goldberger’s  law  partner,  Belohlavek  recused  the  Assistant  State  \nAttorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took \nover the case.  Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally known New York criminal \ndefense attorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer \nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by attacking the credibility of the victim \nwitnesses.   \nMeanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the \ncase to a grand jury.  Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2016, \nhis  office  prosecuted  minors  as  young  as  14  for  prostitution.\n10\n    The  possibility  that  Epstein’s  \nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and \naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.\n11\n  Belohlavek \ntold  OPR  that  her  office  took  the  allegations  against  Epstein  “seriously,  because  .  .  .  it  was  an  \norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we . . . \nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”  However, she said, although \nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can \ncharge.”  Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to \nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice \nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.   \nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges \nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable \nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.\n12\n  \nUnder  Florida  law,  however,  a  grand  jury  is  required  to  bring  criminal  charges  only  in  a  death  \npenalty  case.\n13\n    For  all  other  cases,  a  State  Attorney  has  concurrent  authority  to  file  criminal  \ncharges  by  means  of  a  document  called  an  “information”  or  to  seek  a  grand  jury  indictment.    \nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often \nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by \npublic officials.\n14\n  Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among \n                                                 \n10\n  Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.   \n11\n    Because  the  Florida  Department  of  Law  Enforcement  investigation  into  the  State  Attorney’s  Office’s  \nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR \nhis office’s prosecutive decisions. \n12\n    U.S.  Const.  amend.

PBPD  Chief  Reiter  Becomes  Concerned  with  the  State  Attorney’s  Office’s  \nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation  \nIn 2006, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s attitude had changed and, according \nto Reiter’s statements in his 2009 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were \ncredible.  Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein \nto  appear  in  court  on  misdemeanor  charges,  leading  Reiter  to  begin  questioning  Krischer’s  \nobjectivity  and  the  State  Attorney’s  Office’s  approach  to  the  case.    As  Reiter  explained  in  his  \ndeposition: \nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the attention of the State \nAttorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court.  It’s \nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court.  And I \nknew that it didn’t really matter what the facts were in this case, it \nwas pretty clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute \nthis case. \n On May 1, 2006, Reiter submitted to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing \npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein \nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls.  In his transmittal letter, which was later made \npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Attorney’s Office’s “treatment of \nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”\n16\n  Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that \nyour  office’s  handling  of  this  matter  has  taken”  and  to  consider  disqualifying  himself  from  \nprosecuting Epstein.\n17\n   \nIII. THE  FBI  AND  THE  USAO  INVESTIGATE  EPSTEIN,  AND  THE  DEFENSE  \nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO \nA. May  2006  –  February  2007:    The  Federal  Investigation  Is  Initiated,  and  the  \nUSAO Opens a Case File \nIn  early  2006,  a  West  Palm  Beach  FBI  Special  Agent  who  worked  closely  with  \nAUSA Ann Marie Villafaña on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as \n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafaña in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD \nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity.  The case \nagent told Villafaña that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Attorney’s Office \nwas considering either not charging the case or allowing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor \n                                                 \n15\n  Fla. Stat. § 905.27 (2007). \n16\n  See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. 14, 2006. \n17\n    As  noted,  Krischer  generally  declined  in  his  OPR  interview  to  explain  his  office’s  prosecutive  decisions;  \nhowever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that \nway.”    \n\n \n17 \n \ncharge.    Villafaña  suggested  meeting  with  the  PBPD,  but  the  case  agent  explained  that  before  \nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see how the State Attorney’s Office \ndecided to charge Epstein. \n1. The PBPD Presents the Matter to the FBI and the USAO \n In May 2006, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafaña and \nthe   FBI   case   agent   to   summarize   for   them   the   information   learned   during   the   state’s   \ninvestigation.\n18\n  At the time, neither Villafaña nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any \nknowledge of his background.   \n According to Villafaña, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure \nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s attorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were \nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.\n19\n  The Detective \nexplained  that  the  defense  had  hired  private  investigators  to  trail  Reiter  and  the  Detective,  had  \nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated \nthe removal of the Assistant State Attorney initially assigned to handle the matter, who was viewed \nas  an  aggressive  prosecutor,  by  hiring  a  defense  attorney  whose  relationship  with  the  Assistant  \nState Attorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor.  Further, given the missing computer \nequipment  and  surveillance  camera  videotapes,  the  Detective  believed  Epstein  may  have  been  \n“tipped off” in advance about the search warrant.   \n During the meeting, Villafaña reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could \nbe  brought  against  Epstein.    She  focused  on  18  U.S.C.  §§  2422  (enticement  of  minors  into  \nprostitution\n or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce \nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423 \n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct).  As they discussed these charges, the \nDetective  told  Villafaña  that  Epstein  and  his  assistants  had  traveled  out  of  the  Palm  Beach  \nInternational  Airport  on  Epstein’s  private  airplane,  and  flight  logs  sometimes  referred  to  \npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references \nto  underage  girls.    However,  the  Detective  acknowledged  that  he  was  unable  to  confirm  that  \nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate \nor internationally.  Nevertheless, Villafaña believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part \nbecause of his own interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse \ngirls.  Villafaña discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed \nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified.  She told them that if the evidence \nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal \ninvestigation  would  not  preclude  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  from  charging  Epstein  should  it  \nchoose to do so.   \n                                                 \n18\n  The Detective died in May 2018.   \n19\n  In his 2009 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein matter to the FBI, a Town of Palm \nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims \nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its own problems.”   \n\n \n18 \n \n2. May 2006:  The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File   \nOn May 23, 2006, Villafaña prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file.  Villafaña \ntold  OPR  that  several  aspects  of  the  case  implicated  federal  interests  and  potentially  merited  a  \nfederal  prosecution:    (1)  the  victimization  of  minors  through  the  use  of  facilities  of  interstate  \ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that \nEpstein  had  been  producing  or  possessing  child  pornography  (suggested  by  the  removal  of  the  \ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure \nhad  affected  the  State  Attorney  Office’s  handling  of  the  case.    The  investigation  was  named  \n“Operation  Leap  Year”  because  the  state  investigation  had  identified  approximately  29  girls  as  \nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.\n20\n   \n Villafaña told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that \nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and \nEpstein’s financial resources.  Nonetheless, Villafaña was willing to put in the effort and believed \nthat the FBI was similarly committed to the case.  Villafaña discussed the case with her immediate \nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the \nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2006, it was formally initiated.   \n3. July 14, 2006:  Villafaña Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case \nBecause  Villafaña  was  not  familiar  with  Epstein,  she  researched  his  background  and  \nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation.  Villafaña was aware that Epstein \nhad  hired  multiple  lawyers  to  interact  with  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  in  an  effort  to  derail  the  \nstate  case,  and  she  believed  he  would  likely  do  the  same  in  connection  with  any  federal  \ninvestigation.   \nTherefore,  Villafaña  arranged  to  meet  with  U.S.  Attorney  Alexander  Acosta  and  Jeffrey  \nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.\n21\n  Villafaña told OPR that she had never \nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that \nEpstein  had  improperly  influenced  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  greatly  troubled  her.    Villafaña  \nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the \nEpstein  investigation.    In  addition,  she  viewed  Sloman  as  a  friend,  in  whom  she  had  particular  \nconfidence.    At  this  point,  although  Villafaña’s  immediate  supervisor  was  aware  of  the  case,  \nVillafaña did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office \nand her second-line supervisor, about the matter or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman. \n Villafaña met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July 14, 2006.  She told OPR that at \nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to \n                                                 \n20\n    Villafaña  opened  “Operation  Leap  Year”  during  the  same  month  in  which  the  Department  launched  its  \n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafaña to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood \ncoordinator.   \n21\n  Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Attorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed \nby the Senate until August 3, 2006, and was not sworn in until October 2006.  In September 2006, Acosta announced \nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Matthew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they \nassumed their respective new offices in October 2006.   \n\n \n19 \n \nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure” \nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring attorneys who had personal connections to the \nState Attorney.  Villafaña said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset \nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely \nemploy.  Villafaña explained, “When you have a case that you know people are going to be getting \ncalls about . . .\n you just want to make sure that they know about it so they don’t get . . . a call from \nout of the blue.”  According to Villafaña, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to \nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t \nwant  to  get  to  the  end  and  have  [the]  same  situation  occur”  with  a  federal  prosecution  as  had  \noccurred with the state.  She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected \nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s \nresources  if  the  Office  would  just  back  down  to  pressure  at  the  end.”    According  to  Villafaña,  \nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.”  In a later \nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafaña recounted that she spoke with Acosta and \nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal \nprosecution if the U.S. Attorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green \nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.   \n  Both  Acosta  and  Sloman  told  OPR  that  they  did  not  recall  the  July  2006  meeting  with  \nVillafaña.    Each  told  OPR  that  at  the  time  the  federal  investigation  was  initiated,  he  had  not  \npreviously heard of Epstein.\n22\n   \nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man \nwho  was  “doing  sordid  things”  with  girls,  and  that  it  “seemed  a  reasonable  matter  to  pursue”  \nfederally.  Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told \nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.”  When asked by OPR to articulate the \nfederal  interest  he  perceived  at  the  time  to  be  implicated  by  the  case,  Acosta  responded,  “the  \nexploitation  of  girls  or  minor  females.”    Regarding  Villafaña’s  view  that  she  had  been  given  a  \n“green  light”  to  proceed  with  the  investigation,  Acosta  told  OPR  that  he  would  not  likely  have  \nexplicitly told Villafaña to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been \nsimply  to  acknowledge  the  information  she  shared  about  the  case  and  confirm  that  a  federal  \ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”   \n  Sloman  told  OPR  that  he  could  not  recall  what  he  initially  knew  about  the  Epstein  \ninvestigation,  other  than  that  he  had  a  basic  understanding  that  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  had  \n“abdicated  their  responsibility”  to  investigate  and  prosecute  Epstein.    In  his  OPR  interview,  \nSloman  did  not  recall  with  specificity  Villafaña’s  concern  about  Epstein’s  team  pressuring  the  \nState Attorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect \nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2006, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically \nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.   \n                                                 \n22\n    Lourie  told  OPR  that  when  he  first  heard  about  the  Leap  Year  investigation,  he  likewise  was  unaware  of  \nEpstein.  On July 24, 2006, Villafaña emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as \na “Manhattan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and \nKevin Spacey.”  Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.       \n\n \n20 \n \n4. Late  July  2006:    The  State  Indicts  Epstein,  and  the  USAO  Moves  \nForward with a Federal Investigation \nSeveral days after Villafaña spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant \nState  Attorney  Belohlavek  presented  the  case  to  the  state  grand  jury.\n23\n    Krischer  told  OPR  that  \n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury.  According to a statement made at the time by the \nState Attorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest \nto lowest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of \nthe room.\n24\n  The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony \nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony under state law because \nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.\n25\n  The indictment did not identify the person or \npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.\n26\n  On July 23, \n2006,  Epstein  self-surrendered  to  be  arrested  on  the  indictment,  but  was  not  detained,  and  the  \ncharges were made public.\n \n  \nVillafaña told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that \npoint because she believed the State Attorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a \nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy \nmight  preclude  a  federal  prosecution.\n27\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  at  the  time,  she  “definitely  \nbelieved  that  we  were  going  to  proceed  to  [a  federal]  indictment,  assuming  that  .  .  .  we  had  \nsufficient evidence.” \n                                                 \n23\n  Villafaña and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed \nthem.  Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance \nin this Report.   \n24\n    Larry  Keller,  “Police  say  lawyer  tried  to  discredit  teenage  girls,”  Palm  Beach  Post,  July  29,  2006,  citing  \nstatement by State Attorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.   \n25\n  Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2006CF9454AXX (July 19, 2006), attached as Exhibit 1 to this Report. \n26\n  In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the 1st day of August [2004] and October 31, 2005, \n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three \nor more occasions.”  The 15-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made \nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the \nstate indictment.  Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward \nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.   \n27\n  The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal \ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses.  The Constitution does not prohibit the federal \ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquitted, or convicted on state charges based on \nthe same criminal conduct.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition \nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns.  See, e.g., Gamble v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. \n187,  195  (1959)  (and  cases  cited  therein);  and  United  States  v.  Lanza,  260  U.S.  377,  382  (1922).    Nonetheless,  to  \nbetter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in 1959 and 1960 to \nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.  See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a \nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy. \n\n \n21 \n \n On July 24, 2006, Villafaña alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Attorney’s \nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.\n28\n  On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally \nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it.  Villafaña \ntold  Sloman  that  the  FBI  agents  “are  getting  copies  of  all  of  the  evidence  and  we  are  going  to  \nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal \ncharges  against  Epstein  was  August  25,  2006.    Acosta  emailed  Sloman,  asking  whether  it  was  \n“appropriate to approach [State Attorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might \ngo?”  Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.”\n29\n   \n Although Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more \nactive  role  in  supervising  the  investigation,  Villafaña  continued  to  update  Acosta  and  Sloman  \ndirectly on the progress of the case.\n30\n  Villafaña’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had \nlittle  involvement  in  supervising  the  Epstein  investigation,  and  at  times,  Villafaña  directed  her  \nemails  to  Sloman,  Menchel,  and  Lourie  without  copying  her  immediate  supervisor.    In  the  \nimmediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the \ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”\n31\n   \n By late August 2006, Villafaña and the FBI had identified several additional victims and \nobtained  “some  flight  manifests,  telephone  messages,  and  cell  phone  records  that  show  the  \ncommunication  and  travel  in  interstate  commerce”  by  Epstein  and  his  associates.    Villafaña  \nreported to her supervisors that the State Attorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the \nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to \nrelinquish  the  evidence  to  the  FBI.”    Villafaña  also  told  her  supervisors  that  she  expected  “a  \nnumber  of  fights”  over  her  document  demands,  and  that  some  parties  were  refusing  to  comply  \n“after having contact with Epstein or his attorneys.”   \nVillafaña’s  reference  to  anticipated  “fights”  and  lack  of  compliance  led  Sloman  to  ask  \nwhether she was referring to the victims.  Villafaña responded that the problems did not involve \nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to \ndocument demands as overly burdensome.  Villafaña explained to Sloman and Lourie that some \nvictims  were  “scared  and/or  embarrassed,”  and  some  had  been  intimidated  by  the  defense,  but  \n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.”  Villafaña \n                                                 \n28\n  On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafaña had not yet briefed about the case, noting that \nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”   \n29\n  During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was \nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some \ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Attorney’s Office] and the defense team.”  \n30\n  After Villafaña sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman, \nand Acosta on August 23, 2006, Lourie emailed Sloman:  “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the \ncase?”  Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.  If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it \nthrough you guys.”      \n31\n  OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office, \nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel.  Records show, and Villafaña told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s attorneys \n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory \nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.   \n\n \n22 \n \nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped \nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies \nwill be noted and considered.”  She conceded that “[g]etting them to tell their stories in front of a \njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the \ncourse.”  She acknowledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”   \nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered \nup very well” with the USAO.  She recalled that there was little higher-level management oversight \neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were allowed to do what we needed to do to get our \njob  done.”    This  included  continuing  to  identify,  locate,  and  interview  victims  and  Epstein  \nemployees,  and  obtaining  records  relating  to  Epstein’s  travel,  communications,  and  financial  \ntransactions.  The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”   \n5. October  2006  –  February  2007:    Epstein’s  Defense  Counsel  Initiate  \nContact with Villafaña, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting \n Just as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became \naware  of  the  federal  investigation,  both  because  the  FBI  was  interviewing  his  employees  and  \nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses.  One of Epstein’s New York \nattorneys,  Gerald  Lefcourt,  made  initial  contact  with  Villafaña  in  August  2006.    As  the  \ninvestigation   progressed,   Epstein   took   steps   to   persuade   the   USAO   to   decline   federal   \nprosecution.\n32\n    As  with  the  state  investigation,  Epstein  employed  attorneys  who  had  experience  \nwith  the  Department  and  relationships  with  individual  USAO  personnel.\n33\n    One  of  Epstein’s  \nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of \nFlorida,  made  an  overture  on  Epstein’s  behalf  in  early  November  2006.\n34\n    Lewis  telephoned  \nVillafaña,  a  call  that  Sloman  joined  at  Villafaña’s  request.    Lewis  offered  to  provide  Villafaña  \n                                                 \n32\n  Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.” \n33\n    Chapter  One,  Section  III.B  of  this  Report  identifies  several  of  the  attorneys  known  to  have  represented  \nEpstein  in  connection  with  the  federal  investigation,  along  with  a  brief  summary  of  their  connections  to  the  \nDepartment,  the  USAO,  or  individuals  involved  in  the  investigation.    At  least  one  former  AUSA  also  represented  \nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein.  Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized \nEpstein was selecting attorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as \n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”   \n34\n  Lewis served in the USAO for over 10 years, and was U.S. Attorney from 2000 to 2002.  He then served for \ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the \nU.S. Attorneys.  \nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that \nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA \nand also represented Epstein.  Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law \npartner  created  either  a  conflict  of  interest  or  an  appearance  of  impropriety  mandating  recusal.    The  Professional  \nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under \nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.”  Thereafter, Sloman authorized \nLourie to continue supervising the case.  During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to \nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.   \n\n \n23 \n \n“‘anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process.  Lewis asked to meet with Villafaña \nand Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafaña declined.   \n Shortly thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former AUSA, contacted Sloman and advised him \nthat she also represented Epstein.  Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2000 to September \n2005 and had been a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes section at the time Menchel was \nthe  Chief.    According  to  Sloman’s  contemporaneous  email  recounting  the  conversation,  when  \nSanchez indicated to him that his participation in Lewis’s call with Villafaña led the defense team \nto believe that the matter had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tried to “disabuse” her of \nthat notion.  Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible” \nin working with the USAO.  Despite the fact that Lewis had already made contact with the USAO \non Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a letter to Villafaña on November 15, 2006, in which she asserted \nthat she and Gerald Lefcourt were representing Epstein and asked that the USAO direct all contact \nor  communications  about  Epstein  to  them.    In  response,  Villafaña  requested  that  the  defense  \nprovide documents and information pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents \nand  information  that  Epstein  had  previously  provided  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Office,  and  \n“computers,  hard  drives,  CPUs  [computer  processing  units],  and  any  other  computer  media”  \nremoved from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant in October 2005.  In \nJanuary  2007,  Sanchez  contacted  Villafaña  to  schedule  a  meeting,  but  Villafaña  responded  that  \nshe wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.   \n Immediately after receiving Villafaña’s response, Sanchez bypassed Villafaña and phoned \nLourie, with whom she had worked when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting.  Lourie agreed \nto meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Lourie explained to Villafaña that Sanchez was concerned \nthat federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and “make a pitch,” and \npromised that once given the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that \nwould be a possibility.”  Villafaña told Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents \nshe had promised, and Villafaña wanted “the documents not the pitch.”  Lourie explained to OPR, \nhowever, that it was his practice to grant meetings to defense counsel; he considered it “good for \nus” to learn the defense theories of a case and believed that “information is power.”  Lourie further \nexplained that learning what information the defense viewed as important could help the USAO \nform its strategy and determine which counts relating to which victims should be charged.  Lourie \nalso  believed  that  as  a  general  matter,  prosecutors  should  grant  defense  requests  to  make  a  \npresentation, because “[p]art of [the] process is for them to believe they are heard.”  In addition to \nagreeing  to  a  meeting,  Lourie  sent  Sanchez  a  narrowed  document  request,  which  responded  to  \nSanchez’s  complaint  that  the  USAO’s  earlier  request  was  overbroad  but  which  retained  the  \ndemand for the computer-related items removed from Epstein’s home.  The meeting was scheduled \nfor  February  1,  2007,  and  Lourie  asked  Sanchez  to  provide  the  documents  and  materials  to  the  \nUSAO by January 25, 2007. \n Villafaña did not agree with Lourie’s decision to meet with Sanchez and Lefcourt.  Indeed, \ntwo days after Lourie agreed to the meeting, Villafaña alerted him that she had spoken again with \nSanchez and learned that Epstein was not going to provide the requested documents.  As Villafaña \ntold Lourie, “I just get to listen to the pitch and hear about how the girls are liars and drug users.”  \nShe told OPR that in her view, “it was way too early to have a meeting,” she already knew what \nthe defense would say, and she could not see how a meeting would benefit the federal investigation.  \nShe  explained  to  Lourie  the  basis  for  her  objections  to  the  meeting,  but  Lourie  “vehemently”  \n\n \n24 \n \ndisagreed  with  her  position.    Villafaña  and  a  West  Palm  Beach  AUSA  with  whom  she  was  \nconsulting  about  the  investigation,  and  who  served  for  a  time  as  her  co-counsel,  both  recalled  \nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.  \nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.\n35\n  According to Villafaña, Lourie believed \nthat a meeting with the defense attorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal \ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO \nmight  learn  information  helpful  to  a  prosecution.    Villafaña  told  OPR,  however,  that  while  this  \nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or \nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to \nthe conduct.  Villafaña also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information \nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended \nto charge, which Villafaña did not want to reveal.   \n6. February 2007:  Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaña and \nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case \n At the February 1, 2007 meeting with Lourie and Villafaña, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out \narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal \ninvestigation.  In support of their arguments, the defense attorneys provided a 25-page letter, along \nwith  documents  the  defense  had  obtained  from  the  state’s  investigative  file  and  potential  \nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.    \nIn  the  letter  and  at  the  meeting,  defense  counsel  argued  that  (1)  the  allegations  did  not  \nprovide  a  basis  for  the  exercise  of  federal  jurisdiction;  (2)  the  evidence  did  not  establish  that  \nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving \nthat  any  girl  traveled  interstate  to  engage  in  sex  with  Epstein;  (4)  the  USAO  would  violate  the  \nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a matter that had already been addressed by the \nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.  \nThe  letter  suggested  that  “misleading  and  inaccurate  reports”  from  the  PBPD  “may  well  have  \naffected” the USAO’s view of the case.  The letter also claimed that the State Attorney’s Office \nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s \ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the letter), and argued that “with witnesses of their \nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.”  Lourie told OPR \nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafaña told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded \nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.” \nB. February  –  May  2007:    Villafaña  and  the  FBI  Continue  to  Investigate;  \nVillafaña  Drafts  a  Prosecution  Memorandum  and  Proposed  Indictment  for  \nUSAO Managers to Review \n  Correspondence  between  Villafaña  and  defense  counsel  show  that  Villafaña  carefully  \nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes \n                                                 \n35\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  in  a  “heated  conversation”  on  the  subject,  Lourie  told  them  they  were  not  being  \n“strategic thinkers.”  Her fellow AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as \nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.  Lourie did not recall making \nthe statement but acknowledged that he could have.   \n\n \n25 \n \nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.\n36\n  Villafaña \nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert \nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims.  She also continued collecting records \nrelating  to  Epstein’s  business  entities,  in  part  to  help  establish  the  interstate  nexus  of  Epstein’s  \nactivity.  On several occasions, Villafaña sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable \nnational  expertise  in  child  exploitation  cases,  about  legal  issues  relating  to  the  case,  such  as  \nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.  \nUSAO  procedures  generally  required  that  a  proposed  indictment  be  accompanied  by  a  \nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case.  The prosecution memorandum was \nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant \nprocedural,  factual,  and  legal  issues  of  which  the  AUSA  was  aware;  witness-related  issues;  \nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues.  Routine prosecutions could be approved by lower-level \nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and \napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Attorney.  \nAccordingly, Villafaña drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta, \nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous \nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May 1, \n2007, supporting a proposed 60-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes \nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors.  The prosecution memorandum set forth \nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other \nstatutes  were  rejected  as  proposed  charges;  described  the  evidence  supporting  each  count  and  \npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who \nwere expected to testify at trial.    \n  Villafaña’s  immediate  supervisor  told  OPR  that  she  read  the  prosecution  memorandum,  \nhad  only  a  few  small  edits  to  the  indictment,  and  advised  Lourie  that  she  approved  of  it.    The  \nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the \ncase was complex and that Villafaña would need co-counsel.   \nIn  his  OPR  interview,  Lourie  recalled  thinking  that  the  prosecution  memorandum  and  \nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to \nemploy  a  different  strategy  for  charging  the  case,  focusing  initially  only  on  the  victims  that  \npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already \nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination.  Lourie told OPR that although he had some \nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues \nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as \ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution. \n Although indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require \napproval  in  Miami,  in  this  case,  Lourie  understood  that  “[b]ecause  there  was  front  office  \ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go \n                                                 \n36\n    Lefcourt  and  Sanchez  provided  the  recordings  during  a  follow-up  meeting  with  Lourie  and  Villafaña  on  \nFebruary 20, 2007, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.   \n\n \n26 \n \nforward with charges in this case.  Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to \nMenchel.  Lourie’s transmittal message read: \nMarie did a 50 [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case.  I am going \nto start reading it tonight. . . .  It’s a major case because the target is \none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.  He \nhas  a  stable  of  attorneys,  including  Dershowitz,  [Roy]  Black,  \nLefcourt,  Lewis,  and  Lily  [sic]  Sanchez.    Jeff  Sloman  is  familiar  \nwith  the  investigation.    The  state  intentionally  torpedoed  it  in  the  \ngrand jury so it was brought to us.  I am going to forward the pros \nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do.  The \nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical, \nbut we might as well get a jump on it.  I have some ideas about the \nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am \nnot sending that yet. \nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not \nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.   \nA  few  days  later,  Lourie  emailed  Menchel,  asking  if  Menchel  had  read  the  prosecution  \nmemorandum.    Lourie  directed  Menchel’s  attention  to  particular  pages  of  the  prosecution  \nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled \nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they \nwere 18.\n37\n  Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think \nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Attorney’s Office “went out of their \nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain \naway to nothing.”   \nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmitting the prosecution \nmemorandum  was  his  “official  introduction”  to  the  case  and  at  that  point  in  time,  he  had  never  \nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background.  He recalled that the USAO had \nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately.  Menchel told \nOPR,  however,  that  he  had  little  memory  about  the  facts  of  the  case  or  what  contemporaneous  \nopinions he formed about it.  \nAcosta  told  OPR  that  he  could  not  recall  whether  he  ever  read  Villafaña’s  prosecution  \nmemorandum,  explaining  that  he  “would  typically  rely  on  senior  staff,”  who  had  more  \nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the \ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document.   Acosta \n                                                 \n37\n    In  various  submissions  to  the  USAO,  the  defense  contended  that  the  federal  statute  required  proof  that  \nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was \nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes.  The defense also \nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under 18, but that \nEpstein  “took  affirmative  steps  to  ensure  that  every  woman  was  at  least  18  years  of  age.”    In  her  prosecution  \nmemorandum, however, Villafaña set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual \nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel.  She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the \ndefendant knew the victims were minors.          \n\n \n27 \n \nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he \ncould  not  recall  with  specificity  when  those  conversations  took  place  or  the  details  of  the  \ndiscussions.   \nSloman  told  OPR  that  because  of  his  broad  responsibilities  as  FAUSA,  he  left  it  to  \nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial attorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly \nwith  Acosta,  and  Sloman  recalled  that  it  was  Menchel  and  Lourie  who  conducted  a  “granular  \nreview” of the charging package.  Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a \nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking \nthe lead on the Epstein matter, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.   \nC. May – June 2007:  Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum \nand Proposed Charges \nWhen she submitted the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña intended to file charges by \nMay 15, 2007, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafaña, however, \nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule.  The managers in Miami wanted time to \nanalyze  the  lengthy  prosecution  memorandum  and  consider  the  potential  charges  and  charging  \nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that \nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May 15, Sloman advised Villafaña that “[t]his Office \nhas not approved the indictment.  Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”\n38\n    \n  On  May  10,  2007,  with  Menchel’s  concurrence,  Lourie  sent  a  copy  of  Villafaña’s  \nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterbaan, who in turn sent it to his deputy \nand  another  CEOS  attorney,  asking  them  to  assess  the  legal  issues  involved  in  the  case  and  \ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”\n39\n  After \nCEOS  reviewed  the  materials,  Oosterbaan  responded  to  Lourie  with  an  email  stating  that  the  \nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafaña “has correctly focused \non the issues as we see them.”  He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to \nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafaña’s assessments but noting that further \nresearch  was  needed  to  determine  whether  certain  statutes  required  proof  of  a  defendant’s  \nknowledge of victims’ ages.  Oosterbaan offered to assign a CEOS attorney to work with Villafaña \non the case.  Lourie forwarded Oosterbaan’s email to Menchel and Villafaña.    \n Meanwhile, contemporaneous emails show that Lourie, at least, was already considering \nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.\n40\n  After Lourie spoke with \n                                                 \n38\n  Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a \nbeauty pageant . . . where he is a judge.”\n  The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed \nwith  the  decision,  and  that  the  Supervisory  Special  Agent  was  “extremely  upset”  about  it.    After  the  federal  \ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2006, Epstein largely stayed \naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.      \n39\n  Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterbaan was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good \nfriends with Lourie.   \n40\n  In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may \nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening \na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.   \n\n \n28 \n \nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2007, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be \nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding, \n“I did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and \noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment.  That \nwould have sent them thru the roof.”  Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing \nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea \ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\n41\n   \nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterbaan’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was . . . a \nbit  of  uncharted  territory,”  involving  facts  that  were  unlike  the  case  law  Oosterbaan  had  cited.    \nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably” \ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of \nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.”  But while Lourie “thought \nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were \nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a \nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a \nloss  would  be  that  the  defendant  did  not  go  to  jail.    Lourie  told  OPR  that  to  the  best  of  his  \nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government \nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to \nrequire  Epstein  to  register  as  a  sex  offender  and  the  availability  of  monetary  damages  for  the  \nvictims.  Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should settle and we should set it up so we can \nsettle  it”  by,  for  example,  charging  Epstein  by  complaint  and  then  negotiating  a  plea  to  limited  \ncharges in a criminal information.  Villafaña told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal \ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the \ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” toward a pre-indictment plea.   \n  Although  Lourie  and  Villafaña  believed  a  pre-indictment  plea  agreement  was  a  desired  \nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to \nwork together to shape an indictment.   On May 10, 2007, Lourie emailed Villafaña: \n[M]arie \nI  believe  that  Epstein’s  att[orneys]  are  scared  of  the  victims  they  \ndon’t know.  Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.  \nThus I believe the f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims \nthey have nothing on at all.  We can add in the other ones that have \nmyspace   [sic]   pages   and   prior   testimony   in   a   [superseding   \nindictment].    I  think  for  the  first  strike  we  should  make  all  their  \nnightmare[]s come true.  Thoughts?\n42\n \n                                                 \n41\n    Lourie  explained  to  OPR  that  the  government’s  dismissal  of  counts  in  an  indictment  required  the  court’s  \napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as \nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allow substantive counts to be dismissed.   \n42\n    Lourie’s  references  to  MySpace  pages  and  “prior  testimony”  referred  to  the  impeachment  information  \nbrought forward by defense counsel.   \n\n \n29 \n \nLourie followed up his email to Villafaña with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated \nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafaña believed “the best \nthing  to  do  is  charge  Epstein  by  complaint,  assuming  we  decide  to  charge  him.  .  .  .    The  \n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 20 year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two \nconspiracies  to  cap  him  and  there  is  no  telling  if  a  judge  would  go  for  that  once  we  indict.”\n43\n  \nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can \ndiscuss after that.”   \nLater that afternoon, Villafaña sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel, \nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the \nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be 168 to 210 months, and that in her view, the facts warranted \nan  upward  departure  from  that  range.    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  although  Lourie  proposed  some  \nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient \nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case. \n  In  an  email  to  Acosta  and  Menchel  on  May  11,  2007,  Lourie  recommended  charging  \nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea: \nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him.  Not sure that I \nagree with the charging strategy as it is now, but at this point I think \nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover \nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.  \nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some \nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree.  We can \ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely \nand which victims should be charged. \nI  also  think  if  we  choose  to  go  forward,  we  should  start  with  a  \ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants \na pre-indictment resolution.  That would give us more control [over] \na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss \ncounts.  We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a \nplea attractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we \ntry to dismiss indicted counts. \n Although her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafaña \nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.  \nShe  continued  preparing  to  charge  Epstein.    Two  weeks  after  submitting  the  prosecution  \nmemorandum, on May 14, 2007, Villafaña informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein \nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges \nthe next day.  Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrow,” \nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-town conference, \nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure \n                                                 \n43\n  Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, the general \n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.   \n\n \n30 \n \nhe is comfortable before proceeding.”  Menchel told Villafaña he had “trouble understanding” why \nshe was in a “rush” “given how long this case has been pending.”\n44\n    \nOPR  questioned  Lourie,  Menchel,  Sloman,  and  Acosta  about  the  timeline  for  reviewing  \nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges.  Acosta and Menchel believed Villafaña’s \ntimeline was unrealistic from the start.  Acosta told OPR that Villafaña was “very hard charging,” \nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.”  Menchel described Villafaña \nas  “out  over  her  skis  a  little  bit”  and  “ahead  of”  Acosta  in  terms  of  his  analysis  of  the  case.\n45\n  \nMenchel  said  it  was  clear  to  him  that  Acosta  “was  going  to  be  the  one  making  the  call”  about  \nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision.  Menchel \ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision \non.”    Sloman  told  OPR  that  although  he  did  not  conduct  a  “granular  review”  of  the  proposed  \ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the \nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.”  Lourie told \nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”   \nVillafaña continued to seek direction from her managers.  On May 15, 2007, she emailed \nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will \nnot do any good.  Am I right about that?”  Sloman responded, “Yes.”  On May 21, 2007, three \nweeks  after  submitting  the  prosecution  memorandum,  Villafaña  emailed  Sloman  and  Menchel  \nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed–i.e., approval of an indictment something \nlike  the  current  draft,  a  complaint  to  allow  for  pre-indictment  negotiations,  an  indictment  \ndrastically different from the current draft?”  Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n46\n  \nD. Defense   Counsel   Seek   a   Meeting   with   Senior   USAO   Managers,   which   \nVillafaña Opposes \n Meanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the \nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta.  In a May 10, \n2007 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s attorneys “want me to tell them the statutes \n                                                 \n44\n  Villafaña explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:  \n“In terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars.  That was our \ntime concern.”  Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña offering this explanation to him.  OPR \nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafaña \nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events.  When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those \nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the \ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.   \n45\n  Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafaña was “ahead of where the office was internally” and \nthat caused “discontent” between Villafaña and Menchel.  Villafaña was not the only one, however, who was surprised \nthat the indictment was not approved immediately.  The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed” \nafter Villafaña submitted the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum towards an indictment abated.  Villafaña’s \nimmediate  supervisor  told  OPR  that  from  her  perspective,  it  appeared  “Miami  didn’t  want  the  case  prosecuted.”    \nHowever, Menchel rebuked Villafaña in his July 5, 2007 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing \ncharges in] this matter was a foregone conclusion.”    \n46\n  Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he \nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.   \n\n \n31 \n \nwe are contemplating so Dershowitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”\n47\n  Lourie told Menchel, “I \ndon’t  see  the  downside,”  but  added,  “Marie  is  against  it.”    Menchel  responded  that  it  was  \n“premature” to provide the information.  During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically \nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information, \nbut  speculated  that  it  was  too  soon  after  the  prosecution  memorandum  had  been  circulated  for  \nAcosta to have made a decision about how he wanted to proceed.  This recollection is consistent \nwith the May 2007 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.   \n  On  May  22,  2007,  defense  counsel  Lefcourt  emailed  Lourie  a  letter  to  “confirm”  that  \nEpstein’s attorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached \na  final  decision  on  charging  Epstein.    Lourie  forwarded  the  letter  to  Menchel  and  Sloman,  but  \nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting \nwith  him.    Lourie  suggested  that  Menchel  meet  with  defense  counsel,  adding,  “Whether  Alex  \nwould  be  present  or  grant  them  another  meeting  after  that  is  his  call.”    Lourie  also  emailed  \nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges, \nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.   \n Although Lourie’s emails show that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers \nmeeting  with  defense  counsel,  Villafaña  opposed  such  a  meeting.    Several  emails  indicate  that  \nMenchel  traveled  to  West  Palm  Beach  to  meet  with  Lourie  and  Villafaña  on  the  afternoon  of  \nMay 23,  2007.\n48\n    On  that  same  date,  Villafaña  drafted  an  email,  which  she  planned  to  send  to  \nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel.  Although \nthe email was written for Sloman and Menchel, Villafaña sent it as a draft only to her immediate \nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to how to proceed.   \nHi Jeff and Matt – I just want to again voice my disagreement with \npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or \nany other of Epstein’s attorneys.  As I mentioned, this is not a case \nwhere we will be sitting down to negotiate whether a defendant will \nserve one year versus two years of probation.  This is a case where \nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison \ntime.  Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than \nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case \ndifferently.  Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed \nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed \nat a future meeting.  \nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the \nrest  of  us  combined  and  who  actually  worked  on  the  drafting  of  \nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting.  We \nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our \n                                                 \n47\n  Dershowitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.   \n48\n  During her OPR interview, Villafaña could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose \nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel.  Menchel, similarly, \ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.   \n\n \n32 \n \nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case \nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as \na  white  collar  or  public  corruption  case  where  the  parties  can  \namicably work out a light sentence.\n49\n \nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss, \nthose were already raised in his letter (which is part of the indictment \npackage)  and  during  his  meeting  with  Andy  and  myself.    Those  \nreasons are:  (1) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability \nto  prosecute  Epstein,  (2)  this  shouldn’t  be  a  federal  offense,  and  \n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be \nprosecuted  at  all.    Unless  the  Office  thinks  that  any  of  those  \narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the \nprosecution,  it  will  only  benefit  the  defense.    With  respect  to  \nLefcourt’s  promised  legal  analysis,  that  also  has  already  been  \nprovided.  The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the \ndefense  the  other  charges  that  we  are  considering.    In  my  opinion  \nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution. \nThe  defense  is  anxious  to  have  a  meeting  in  order  to  delay  the  \ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation, \nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation. \nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to \nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case \nwill be disclosed.  However, if you all do decide to go forward with \nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then \nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in \nagreement with the handling of the case. \nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafaña, “Let’s talk before \nthis is sent, please.”\n50\n  Villafaña told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafaña not to send the \nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafaña could be viewed as insubordinate.  She also told \nVillafaña that if Villafaña did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would \nnever serve a day in jail.”     \n Villafaña told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file \ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.  She \nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that \nthe State Attorney’s Office had gone down.”  Villafaña believed the purpose of the defense request \n                                                 \n49\n    In  commenting  on  OPR’s  draft  report,  Menchel’s  counsel  noted  Menchel’s  view  that  the  nature  of  a  \ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel \nto discuss the merits of a case.   \n50\n  The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafaña that she and Villafaña were “not driving the ship,” and \nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”   \n\n \n33 \n \nfor  meetings  was  to  cause  delay,  but  “the  people  in  my  office  either  couldn’t  see  that  or  didn’t  \nwant  to  see  that,”  perhaps  because  of  “their  lack  of  experience  with  these  types  of  cases”  or  a  \nmisguided  belief  “that  [Epstein’s]  attorneys  would  not  engage  in  this  behavior.”    Villafaña  told  \nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s \nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was \na  need  to  move  with  necessary  speed.”    Nonetheless,  Villafaña  followed  the  guidance  of  her  \nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.    \n Like Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good \npractice.    Menchel  told  OPR  that  he  saw  “no  downside”  to  hearing  the  defense  point  of  view.    \nDefense  counsel  might  make  a  persuasive  point  “that’s  actually  going  to  change  our  mind,”  or  \nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and \nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.  \nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafaña ever articulating a concern that Epstein was \ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in \nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those \ncircumstances. \nE. June 2007:  Villafaña Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum  \n While Villafaña’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed \ncharges, Villafaña took additional steps to support them.  On June 14, 2007, she supplemented the \nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of \nthe  victims.    In  the  email  transmitting  the  addendum  to  Lourie,  Menchel,  Sloman,  and  her  \nimmediate supervisor, Villafaña reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,” \nand the “different strategies” about how to structure the charges left Villafaña unsure whether “to \nmake . . . changes now or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”  \nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most \nfrequently”  and  who  had  allegedly  engaged  in  sexual  activity  with  both  Epstein  and  an  Epstein  \nassistant.    In  the  addendum,  Villafaña  identified  documents  she  had  found  corroborating  four  \nseparate statements made by this victim.   \nVillafaña  told  OPR  that  the  only  victim  about  whom  any  supervisor  ever  articulated  \nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum.  Lourie told OPR that he had \nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum \naddressed  one  particular  victim  because  no  one  had  identified  specific  concerns  relating  to  any  \nother  victim.    Villafaña’s  immediate  supervisor  similarly  told  OPR  that  to  her  recollection,  the  \ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.   \nF. The June 26, 2007 Meeting with Defense Counsel  \nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2007, communicating directly \nwith Sanchez about the arrangements.  At Menchel’s instruction, on June 18, 2007, Villafaña sent \na letter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”\n51\n  \n                                                 \n51\n  Villafaña sent copies of this letter to both Menchel and Sanchez.  Villafaña told OPR that she objected to \nsending  this  information  to  the  defense.    Although  Menchel  did  not  recall  directing  Villafaña  to  send  the  letter  to  \n\n \n34 \n \nOn  that  same  day,  Villafaña  emailed  Lourie,  Menchel,  Sloman,  and  her  immediate  supervisor  \ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed \nindictment  and  asking  again  for  feedback.    During  his  OPR  interview,  Lourie  observed  that  \nVillafaña’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody \nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue.  Sloman told OPR that he did not \nknow whether Villafaña received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in \ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about how to proceed. \n The day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmitted to the USAO a \n19-page letter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present \nin  order  to  demonstrate  that  none  of  the  statutes  identified  by  you  can  rightly  be  applied  to  the  \nconduct  at  issue  here.”    Reiterating  their  prior  arguments  and  themes,  defense  counsel  strongly  \ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the matter.  Among other issues, Lefcourt’s \nletter argued: \nx Voluntary  sexual  activity  involving  “young  adults–16  or  17  years  of  age”–was  \n“strictly a state concern.” \nx Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant \nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was \n18 years of age. \nx One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was \nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet \ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims. \nx The  “travel”  statute,  18  U.S.C.  §  2423(b),  prohibits  travel  “for  the  purpose  of”  \nengaging  in  illicit  sexual  conduct,  but  Epstein  traveled  to  Florida  to  visit  family,  \noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of \ndaily living.” \nLefcourt  also  argued  again  that  “irregularities”  had  tainted  the  state’s  case  and  would  “have  a  \nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n52\n \n Lourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafaña, an email dividing the defense arguments \ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points.  Lourie disagreed with the argument that 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) \nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible \nfor federal interest.”  On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not \ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.  \n                                                 \nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafaña’s claim that he had done so.   Menchel also told \nOPR that he did not recall Villafaña objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.      \n52\n    Lefcourt  claimed  there  were  deficiencies  in  the  PBPD  search  warrant  and  “material  misstatements  and  \nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit.  As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable \ncause  to  search  for  videotapes,  “since  all  the  women  who  were  asked  whether  they  had  been  videotaped  denied \nknowledge of any videotaping.”  (Emphasis in original).  \n\n \n35 \n \nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal \nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported \nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole \npurpose.  However, Lourie expressed concern about “getting to the jury” on this issue and noted \nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point.  Villafaña told OPR that she disagreed with \nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the matter with him.\n53\n  Villafaña \nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered \n“particularly weak.”    \nOn June 26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafaña, the case agent, and the West Palm \nBeach  squad  supervisor  met  at  the  Miami  USAO  with  Epstein  attorneys  Dershowitz,  Black,  \nLefcourt,  and  Sanchez.    Dershowitz  led  the  defense  team’s  presentation.    From  the  USAO  \nperspective,  the  meeting  was  merely  a  “listening  session.”\n54\n    Echoing  the  arguments  made  in  \nLefcourt’s  letter,  Dershowitz  argued  that  the  USAO  should  permit  the  state  to  handle  the  case  \nbecause  these  were  “traditionally  state  offenses.”    The  case  agent  recalled  being  uncomfortable  \nthat  the  defense  was  asking  questions  in  an  attempt  to  gain  information  about  the  federal  \ninvestigation,  including  the  number  of  victims  and  the  types  of  sexual  contact  that  had  been  \ninvolved.   \n  Villafaña  told  OPR  that  when  Epstein’s  attorneys  left  the  meeting,  they  appeared  to  be  \n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.”  But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey \nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.”  According \nto  Villafaña,  Lourie,  and  Menchel,  during  a  short  post-meeting  discussion  at  which  Lourie  \nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general \ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense \npresentation  had  not  been  persuasive.    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  she  “left  [the  meeting]  with  the  \nimpression that we were continuing towards” filing charges. \nIV. ACOSTA  DECIDES  TO  OFFER  EPSTEIN  A  TWO-YEAR  STATE  PLEA  TO  \nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION \nUSAO internal communications show that in July 2007, Acosta developed, or adopted, the \nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation.  The agreement would \nleave  the  case  in  state  court  by  requiring  Epstein  to  plead  guilty  to  state  charges,  but  would  \naccomplish  three  goals  important  to  the  federal  prosecutors:    Epstein’s  incarceration;  his  \nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary \n                                                 \n53\n  Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove \nEpstein’s knowledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were 16 or 17 at the time they provided \nmassages.     \n54\n  In his written response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26, \n2007 meeting.  In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had little memory of the meeting, to the best of \nhis  recollection  the  USAO  simply  listened  to  the  defense  presentation,  and  in  a  contemporaneous  email,  Menchel  \nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their \nposition.”   \n\n \n36 \n \ndamages.\n55\n  During a two-month period, the subject attorneys were involved to varying degrees in \nconverting  the  broad  outline  into  specific  terms,  resulting  in  the  NPA  signed  by  Epstein  on  \nSeptember 24, 2007.  The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both \nthe  larger  goals  and  the  case-related  factors  they  likely  considered  during  the  process  of  \nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution.  However, the contemporaneous emails \nand  other  records  do  not  reflect  all  of  the  conversations  among  the  decision  makers,  and  their  \ndeliberative  and  decision-making  process  is  therefore  not  entirely  clear.    In  particular,  Menchel  \nand  Acosta  had  offices  located  near  each  other  and  likely  spoke  in  person  about  the  case,  but  \nneither had a clear memory of their conversations.  Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the \nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.      \nIn  the  following  account,  OPR  discusses  the  initial  key  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation  through  state,  rather  than  federal,  charges,  and  sets  forth  many  of  the  numerous  \ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA.  OPR \nquestioned each of the subjects about how the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution, \nand  OPR  includes  below  the  subjects’  explanations.    The  subjects’  memories  of  particular  \nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus \nemerged  that  there  were  overlapping  concerns  about  the  viability  of  the  legal  theories,  the  \nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the \ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail \nat trial and through appeal.  In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority \nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors.  Based \non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve \nthe matter through a state plea.  In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum, \nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations \nand   the   evidence   against   Epstein   as   set   forth   in   Villafaña’s   prosecution   memorandum.      \nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.  \nA. June  –  July  2007:    The  USAO  Proposes  a  State  Plea  Resolution,  which  the  \nDefense Rejects \nA few days after the June 26, 2007 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafaña, advising her that \nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July 11, 2007, and hoped \n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”\n56\n  In a July 3, 2007 email, Villafaña \ntold  Sloman,  Menchel,  Lourie,  and  her  immediate  supervisor  that  she  intended  to  initiate  plea  \ndiscussions  by  inviting  Sanchez  “to  discuss  a  resolution  of  the  federal  investigation  that  could  \n                                                 \n55\n  State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allow \nlaw enforcement and the public to know the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and, \nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.  The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry \nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act \nof 2006 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration \nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen \nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations. \n56\n  In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands \nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before \nthe October 2005 state search warrant and that Villafaña had been requesting from the defense since late 2006.    \n\n \n37 \n \ninclude  concurrent  time.”    The  email  primarily  concerned  other  issues,  and  Villafaña  did  not  \nexplain  what  the  resolution  she  had  in  mind  would  entail.\n57\n    Villafaña  requested  to  be  advised,  \n“[i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s attorneys that is contrary to this.”  Villafaña, \nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the \ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the \ndefense attorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions \nabout a possible plea.   \n In response to Villafaña’s email, Menchel notified Villafaña that he had told Sanchez “a \nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Attorney],” but Sanchez \nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”\n58\n  During his OPR interview, Menchel had no \nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense \ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”  However, Menchel explained that he would not have made \nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knowledge.  He also pointed out that in numerous emails \nbefore  the  June  26,  2007  meeting,  he  repeatedly  noted  that  Acosta  was  still  deciding  what  he  \nwanted to do with the Epstein case.  Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember \na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have \ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”   \n1. Acosta’s   Explanation   for   His   Decision   to   Pursue   a   State-based   \nResolution \n Subsequent events showed that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was \npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning.  In his OPR interview, Acosta \nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution.  Acosta \nsaid  that  although  he,  Sloman,  and  Menchel  “believed  the  victims”  and  “believed  [Epstein]  did  \nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in \nterms  of  testimony.”\n59\n    Acosta  also  recalled  discussions  with  his  “senior  team”  about  how  the  \nvictims would “do on the stand.” \nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether, \nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.  \n                                                 \n57\n    Villafaña  explained  to  OPR  that  she  intended  to  recommend  a  plea  to  a  federal  conspiracy  charge  and  a  \nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a \nrecommendation  that  the  sentence  on  the  federal  charges  run  concurrent  with  the  state  sentence,  or  that  [Epstein]  \nwould receive credit for time in state custody towards his federal release date.”  See n.65 for an explanation of the \nAshcroft Memo.   \n58\n  Villafaña was then in trial and on July 4, 2007, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafaña responded \nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a \nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”       \n59\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or \ndeciding how to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in \nreaching  the  two-year-state-plea  resolution  through  the  NPA.    However,  Sloman  also  told  OPR  that  he  had  little  \nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and \nMenchel.   \n\n \n38 \n \n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so \nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . \nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the \nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . \nis  an  independent  entity,  and  that  we  should  presume  that  what  \nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except \nin the most unusual of circumstances.   \nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have \nbecome  final,  and  accordingly,  it  was  “prudent”  to  employ  Petite  policy  analysis.    As  Acosta  \nexplained  in  a  public  statement  he  issued  in  2011,  “the  federal  responsibility”  in  this  unique  \nsituation  was  merely  to  serve  as  a  “backstop  [to]  state  authorities  to  ensure  that  there  [was]  no  \nmiscarriage of justice.”\n60\n  Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as \na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the \nfederal  government  because  of  a  perception  that  the  state  charge  was  inadequate.    In  the  latter  \ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”\n61\n  Acosta \nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice.  But it was his understanding \nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable \noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be \nviewed as a manifest injustice. \nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result \nin  unfavorable  precedent,  because  the  Epstein  case  straddled  the  line  between  “solicitation”  or  \n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was \nan  emerging  matter  of  federal  interest.    Acosta  contended  that  in  2006,  “it  would  have  been  \nextremely  unusual  for  any  United  States  Attorney’s  Office  to  become  involved  in  a  state  \nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of \nstate prosecutors.”  Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least \nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking \ncase.”  Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal \nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.   \nAcosta  also  told  OPR  that  he  was  concerned  that  a  trial  would  be  difficult  for  Epstein’s  \nvictims.    In  Acosta’s  estimation,  a  trial  court  in  2007  might  have  permitted  “victim  shaming,”  \nwhich would have been traumatic for them.  In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned \na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the \nstate grand jury found little merit to the case.\n62\n  Acosta told OPR: \n                                                 \n60\n  Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at 1 (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The \nDaily Beast.  \n61\n  Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allowing the presumption that a prior state prosecution \nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate \nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated \nfederal prosecution.”  USAM § 9-2.031.D.   \n62\n    Acosta  told  OPR  he  was  unaware  that  USAO  prosecutors  believed  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  had  \ndeliberately  undermined  the  case  before  the  state  grand  jury.    Menchel  told  OPR  that  he  understood  that  the  State  \n\n \n39 \n \nI  do  think  it’s  important  to  look  back  on  this,  and  try  to  be  in  the  \nshoes  of  the  thought  process  in  2006  and  ’07  when  trafficking  \nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some \njurors  may  have  looked  at  this  as  prostitution,  and  .  .  .  [a]  judge’s  \ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation \non the part of victims . . . .\n63\n \nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning \na  sentence,  because  he  believed  prosecutors  would  have  difficulty  persuading  a  federal  district  \ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence \nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.\n64\n  \nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR, \nThe way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing \nenough.    It  didn’t  provide  for  prison  time.  It  didn’t  provide  for  \nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue.  There were legal \nissues . . . . There were witness issues.  And . . . we could go to trial \n. . . and we may or may not prevail.  Alternatively, we could look at \na  pre-indictment  resolution,  and  at  various  points,  the  office  went  \nback  and  forth  between  a  federal  pre-indictment  resolution,  and  a  \nstate pre-indictment resolution.  \nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in \npart,  the  facts  of  the  Epstein  case  at  the  time  appeared  to  constitute  solicitation  or  prostitution  \nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.”  Acosta explained \nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the \nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because \nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.   \n                                                 \nAttorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand \njury because the State Attorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or \nproceeding on a lesser charge.   \n63\n    Menchel  told  OPR,  however,  that  the  federal  judges  in  West  Palm  Beach  were  highly  regarded  and  were  \ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”     \n64\n    Acosta  said  that  “dismissing  a  number  of  counts  and  then  doing  a  [R]ule  11  is  not  something  that  [South  \nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.”  Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District \nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule \n11(c) pleas.”  \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of \na plea agreement.  The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court \ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void.  Villafaña told OPR that Rule 11(c) pleas \nwere  “uncommon”  in  the  Southern  District  of  Florida,  as  the  “judges  do  not  like  to  be  told  .  .  .  what  sentence  to  \nimpose.”    Menchel  similarly  told  OPR  that  the  USAO  viewed  federal  judges  in  the  Southern  District  of  Florida  as  \naverse to Rule 11(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.  Villafaña told OPR that she had never offered \na Rule 11(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.   \n\n \n40 \n \n  Menchel  could  not  recall  who  initially  suggested  a  state  plea,  but  noted  to  OPR  that  his  \nown “emails . . . make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.”  He \nreferenced,  among  others,  his  May  14,  2007  email  to  Villafaña  informing  her  that  Acosta  was  \ndeciding how he wanted to handle the case.  Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished \ntwo  things  that  Acosta  viewed  as  important:    first,  it  resolved  any  Petite  policy  concerns,  and  \nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have allowed.  Menchel \ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and \nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration.  He \ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you know, it’s not that big a deal.  That was \nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.”  Rather, Menchel said, \n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.” \n2. July 2007:  Villafaña and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State \nResolution  \nVillafaña told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining \nthat  he  had  proposed  to  Sanchez  resolving  the  federal  investigation  through  a  state  plea.    In  \nVillafaña’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond” \nto  Department  policy  requiring  that  a  plea  offer  reflect  “the  most  serious  readily  provable  \noffense.”\n65\n  In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy.  Villafaña \nalso  told  OPR  that  in  her  view,  the  USAM  required  the  USAO  to  confer  with  the  investigative  \nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafaña did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state \nplea.    Villafaña  also  believed  the  CVRA  required  attorneys  for  the  government  to  confer  with  \nvictims  before  making  a  plea  offer,  but  the  victims  had  not  been  consulted  about  this  proposal.    \nVillafaña told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation \nwho had negative impressions of the State Attorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them \nback to the State Attorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.   \n                                                 \n65\n  This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2003 memorandum from then Attorney General John Ashcroft \nregarding  “Department  Policy  Concerning  Charging  Criminal  Offenses,  Disposition  of  Charges,  and  Sentencing”  \n(known as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:  \n[I]n  all  federal  criminal  cases,  federal  prosecutors  must  charge  and  pursue  the  \nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts \nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, United States \nAttorney,   or   designated   supervisory   attorney   in   the   limited   circumstances   \ndescribed below.  The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the \nmost  substantial  sentence  under  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,  unless  a  mandatory  \nminimum  sentence  or  count  requiring  a  consecutive  sentence  would  generate  a  \nlonger sentence.  A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good \nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily \nto  prove  a  charge  at  trial.    Thus,  charges  should  not  be  filed  simply  to  exert  \nleverage to induce a plea.  Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges \nmay   not   be   dismissed   except   to   the   extent   permitted   [elsewhere   in   this   \nMemorandum].  \nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.1.   \n\n \n41 \n \n In light of these concerns, Villafaña emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement \nwith the process: \n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without \nconsulting  with  me  or  the  investigative  agencies,  and  it  is  more  \ninappropriate  to  make  a  plea  offer  that  you  know  is  completely  \nunacceptable   to   the   FBI,   ICE   [Immigration   and   Customs   \nEnforcement], the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate \nthe  Ashcroft  memo,  the  U.S.  Attorney[s’]  Manual,  and  all  of  the  \nvarious  iterations  of  the  victims’  rights  legislation.    Strategically,  \nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position \nof  weakness,  anxious  to  make  the  case  go  away,  by  telling  the  \ndefense  that  we  will  demand  no  federal  conviction.    We  left  the  \nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered, \nand  your  statement  that  a  state  resolution  would  satisfy  us  takes  \naway  that  advantage.    If  you  make  it  seem  like  the  U.S.  Attorney  \ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to \nmake a deal.   \nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for \n“show”  only  and  completely  undermines  my  ability  to  deal  with  \nEpstein’s attorneys directly. . . . \n . . . . \nI  would  like  to  make  a  presentation  to  the  U.S.  Attorney,  Jeff  \n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation \nand a revised indictment.  The presentation will address the points \nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength \nof the case. \nIn  the  meantime,  please  direct  all  communications  from  Epstein’s  \ncounsel to me. \n  Menchel  told  OPR  he  realized  Villafaña  was  “very  anxious”  to  file  charges  in  the  case.    \nVillafaña had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not \nunsympathetic  at  all  to  her  desires”  to  pursue  a  federal  case.    However,  as  Menchel  told  OPR,  \nVillafaña’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a little bit more dispassionate,” and \nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position.  Menchel viewed the tone of Villafaña’s \nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect.  In \nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge \nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S. \nAttorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive \nthe policy.   \n \n \n\n \n42 \n \n Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke: \nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate \nand, in combination with other matters in the past, it seriously calls \nyour judgment into question. \nAs you well know, the US Attorney has not even decided whether \nto go forward with a prosecution in this matter, thus you should have \nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations. \nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you \nmade to the agents in this matter, it was made clear to you by the US \nAttorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first \nauthorized  to  investigate  Mr.  Epstein  that  the  office  had  concerns  \nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of \nlegal  issues.    Despite  being  told  these  things,  you  prepared  a  pros  \nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.  \nIt has come to my attention that you led the agents to believe that \nthe indictment of this matter was a foregone conclusion and that our \ndecision  to  put  off  that  date  and  listen  to  the  defense  attorneys’  \nconcerns  is  indicative  of  the  office  having  second  thoughts  about  \nindicting.    As  you  well  knew,  you  were  never  given  authorization  \nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.\n66\n   \nIn  the  email,  Menchel  went  on  to  explain  the  circumstances  of  his  conversation  with  \nSanchez and respond to Villafaña’s complaints:   \nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting.  It \nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea \noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take \nto resolve the matter.  As you are also well aware, the only reason \nwhy  this  office  even  agreed  to  look  into  the  Epstein  matter  in  the  \nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an \nadequate  job  in  vindicating  the  victims’  rights.    As  you  and  the  \nagents  conceded,  had  Epstein  been  convicted  of  a  felony  that  \nresulted  in  a  jail  sentence  and  sex  offender  status,  neither  the  FBI  \nnor our office ever would have interceded.  You should also know \nthat  my  discussion  with  Lilly  Sanchez  was  made  with  the  US  \nAttorney’s full knowledge.  Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in \npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all \nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.  \nIn any event, I fail to see how a discussion that went nowhere has \nhurt our bargaining position.  I am also quite confident that no one \n                                                 \n66\n  Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie. \n\n \n43 \n \non  the  defense  team  believes  that  the  federal  investigation  in  this  \nmatter has been for show. \nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the \nUSAM  or  any  other  policy  well  taken.    As  Chief  of  the  Criminal  \nDivision, I am the person designated by the US Attorney to exercise \nappropriate   discretion   in   deciding   whether   certain   pleas   are   \nappropriate and consistent with the Ashcroft memo and the USAM \n– not you. \nAs  for  your  statement  that  my  concerns  about  this  case  hurting  \nProject  Safe  Childhood  are  unfounded,  I  made  it  clear  to  you  that  \nthose concerns were voiced by the US Attorney.\n67\n  Whether or not \nyou are correct, matters of policy are always within his purview and \nany decisions in that area ultimately rest with him. \nFinally, you may not dictate the dates and people you will meet with \nabout  this  or  any  other  case.    If  the  U.S.  Attorney  or  the  First  \nAssistant desire to meet with you, they will let you know.  Nor will \nI  direct  Epstein’s  lawyers  to  communicate  only  with  you.    If  you  \nwant  to  work  major  cases  in  the  district  you  must  understand  and  \naccept  the  fact  that  there  is  a  chain  of  command  –  something  you  \ndisregard with great regularity. \nVillafaña acknowledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to \ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable \noffense.    She  disagreed,  however,  with  his  representation  about  her  initial  meeting  with  Acosta  \nand  Sloman  regarding  the  Epstein  investigation,  noting  that  Menchel  had  not  been  at  that  \nmeeting.\n68\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  no  one  had  communicated  to  her  the  “concerns”  Menchel  \nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.\n69\n     \n  A  week  later,  Villafaña  replied  to  Menchel’s  email,  reiterating  her  concerns  about  the  \nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward: \nHi Matt -- My trial is over, so I now have [ ] time to focus back on \nthis case and our e-mail exchange.  There are several points in your \n                                                 \n67\n  Neither Menchel nor Villafaña could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring.  In commenting \non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with \nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of \ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”  \n68\n  Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.   \n69\n  Villafaña characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her] \nplace” by him.  She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”  \nMenchel, however, asserted to OPR that Villafaña had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted \nhis strong response.   \n\n \n44 \n \ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address \nwhere we are in the case. \nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of \ncommand.  After that concern was brought to my attention several \nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of \ncommand. . . .  If there is a particular instance of violating the chain \nof  command  that  you  would  like  to  discuss,  I  would  be  happy  to  \ndiscuss it with you. \n . . . . \nThe  statement  that  I  have  not  respected  Alex’s  position  regarding  \nthe   prosecution   of   the   case   demonstrates   why   you   hear   the   \nfrustration  in  the  tone  of  my  e-mail.    For  two  and  a  half  months  I  \nhave  been  asking  about  what  that  position  is.    I  have  asked  for  \ndirection  on  whether  to  revise  the  indictment,  whether  there  are  \nother  issues  that  Alex  wants  addressed  prior  to  deciding,  whether  \nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc.  None of \nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims, \nand  agents  all  demanding  to  know  why  we  aren’t  presenting  an  \nindictment.    Perhaps  that  lack  of  direction  is  through  no  fault  of  \nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not know to \nwhom  I  should  address  my  frustration.    My  recollection  of  the  \noriginal  meeting  with  Alex  and  Jeff  is  quite  different  than  your  \nsummary.    In  that  meeting,  I  summarized  the  case  and  the  State  \nAttorney’s Office’s handling of it.  I acknowledged that we needed \nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and \nI   noted   the   time   and   money   that   would   be   required   for   an   \ninvestigation.    I  said  that  I  was  willing  to  invest  that  time  and  the  \nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the \nend  and  then  have  the  Office  be  intimidated  by  the  high-powered  \nlawyers.  I was assured that that would not happen.  Now I feel like \nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while \nevidence  suggests  that  Epstein  is  continuing  to  engage  in  this  \ncriminal  behavior.    Additionally,  the  FBI  has  identified  two  more  \nvictims.  If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to \ngive hope to more girls. \nAs  far  as  promising  the  FBI  that  an  indictment  was  a  foregone  \nconclusion,  I  don’t  know  of  any  case  in  the  Office  where  an  \ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict.  And I \nhave  never  presented  an  indictment  package  that  has  resulted  in  a  \ndeclination.  I didn’t treat this case any differently.  I worked with \nthe  agents  to  gather  the  evidence,  and  I  prepared  an  indictment  \npackage  that  I  believe  establishes  probable  cause  that  a  series  of  \ncrimes have been committed.  More importantly, I believe there is \n\n \n45 \n \nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.  \nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Attorney \nor anyone else.  I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting, \nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense \nattorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.  With \nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say \nthat  disagreements  about  strategy  and  raising  concerns  about  the  \nforgotten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified \nas  a  lapse  in  judgment.    This  Office  should  seek  to  foster  spirited  \ndebate  about  the  law  and  the  use  of  prosecutorial  discretion  .  .  .  .  \n[M]y  first  and  only  concern  in  this  case  (and  my  other  child  \nexploitation  cases)  is  the  victims.    If  our  personality  differences  \nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case \nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights. \nIn  the  meantime,  I  will  be  meeting  with  the  agents  on  Monday  to  \nbegin  preparing  a  revised  indictment  package  containing  your  \nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by \nEpstein’s attorneys. . . .  If there are any specific issues that you or \nthe U.S. Attorney would like to see addressed, please let me know.\n70\n \n Villafaña did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested.  She viewed Menchel’s \nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even \nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise \nher  concerns.\n71\n    Menchel,  however,  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  “order”  Villafaña  to  refrain  from  \nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafaña \nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta.  Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running \nroughshod over the U.S. Attorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process.  You’re not \nin charge of it.  I’m not in charge of it.  [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”  Acosta, who was apparently \nnot  aware  of  Villafaña’s  email  exchange  with  Menchel,  told  OPR  that  from  his  perspective,  \nVillafaña was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him \ndirectly for a meeting.   \nB. Villafaña   Attempts   to   Obtain   the   Computer   Equipment   Missing   from   \nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts \nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2007 how to resolve the federal investigation, \none  item  of  evidence  they  did  not  have  available  to  assist  in  that  decision  was  the  computer  \nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant.  Although \nVillafaña took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.   \n                                                 \n70\n  Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.   \n71\n  Villafaña told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafaña, but that \nMenchel responded it was not Villafaña’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.  \n\n \n46 \n \nEarly  in  the  federal  investigation,  Villafaña  recognized  the  potential  significance  of  \nobtaining the missing computer equipment.  Villafaña told OPR that she and the FBI agents went \nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as \nchild pornography.  Nevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein \nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed \nhe  could  have  engaged  in  similar  conduct  in  his  Palm  Beach  home.    In  addition,  the  computer  \nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements \nabout visiting Epstein’s home.  More generally, in Villafaña’s experience, individuals involved in \nchild  exploitation  often  possessed  child  pornography.\n72\n    Villafaña’s  co-counsel,  who  had  \nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a \nbillionaire.  We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his \ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.   \nAs  the  investigation  continued,  Villafaña  took  various  steps  to  acquire  the  computer  \nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.  As noted previously in this Report, in \nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he \ncomputers,  hard  drives,  CPUs,  and  any  other  computer  media  (including  CD-ROMs,  DVDs,  \nfloppy  disks,  flash  drives,  etc.)  removed  from”  the  residence.    Although  Lourie  subsequently  \nnarrowed the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.  \nThe defense, however, failed to comply with the request.   \n  Villafaña  learned  that  the  computer  equipment  was  in  the  possession  of  a  particular  \nindividual.  After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section \nand  Office  of  Enforcement  Operations  about  the  appropriate  legal  steps  to  obtain  the  computer  \nequipment,  Villafaña  described  her  plan  in  an  email  to  Menchel.    She  asked  Menchel  for  any  \ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR \nthat he did not recall Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n \n \n  In  May  2007,  following  the  plan  she  had  outlined  to  Menchel,  Villafaña  initiated  action  \nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.  In her email to Villafaña on \nJune 29, 2007, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based \nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.\n73\n  Villafaña advised her supervisors of the request, \nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”  \nNonetheless, Villafaña eventually agreed to an extension. \n Meanwhile, Epstein attorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafaña, demanding to know \nwhether Villafaña had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer \n                                                 \n72\n  In addition, Villafaña became aware that in August 2007, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated \nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of \nthe girls.   \n73\n    This  email  led  Villafaña  to  ask  her  supervisors  if  any  of  them  had  discussed  with  the  defense  a  possible  \nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafaña’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of \nthe case.   See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.  \n\n \n47 \n \nequipment.\n74\n  After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafaña, and \nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the \nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained below, never happened \nbecause the parties entered into the NPA. \nC. July 2007:  The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation \nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment, \ndefense counsel also sent letters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2007, and July 25, 2007, reiterating \ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein.  The July 25, 2007 letter included a lengthy \n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had committed no \nfederal offense.  The July 25 letter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former \nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that \nthis is not a matter upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n75\n   \nWhile  the  defense  was  reiterating  its  objections  to  the  federal  investigation,  CEOS  \nexpressed its endorsement of Villafaña’s legal analysis and proposed charges.  On July 18, 2007, \nCEOS  Chief  Oosterbaan  emailed  Sloman,  Menchel,  and  Lourie,  stating  that  he  had  read  \nVillafaña’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job.  As we \nopined  to  Andy  [Lourie]  back  in  May,  [CEOS]  agree[s]  with  her  legal  analysis.    Her  charging  \ndecisions are legally sound.”  Oosterbaan observed: \nI  have  also  reviewed  the  arguments  contained  in  the  letters  from  \ndefense counsel.  Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive, \nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive.  That is not to say that \nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit.  I expect the judge \nto consider some of the arguments closely.  Nevertheless, while the \nlaw  applicable  here  is  not  always  crystal  clear,  the  balance  of  \navailable precedent favors us.  From the prosecution memorandum \nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments, \nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.  \nAnd,  while  with  this  prosecution  the  government  clearly  faces  a  \nstrong  and  determined  defense  team,  it  is  a  challenge  well  worth  \nfacing.  I also happen to know that there is absolutely no concern . . . \nabout facing the challenges this case presents. \nIn closing, Oosterbaan renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to \nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.   \n                                                 \n74\n  Villafaña forwarded Black’s letter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the \ncomputer  equipment  from  Epstein’s  home,  the  steps  she  had  taken  to  make  the  required  consultations  in  the  \nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.   \n75\n    The  news  that  the  former  CEOS  Principal  Deputy  Chief  was  advising  the  Epstein  team  led  to  an  email  \nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan, who commented, “By the way, let me know if you want me \nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised \nwith similar facts.”   \n\n \n48 \n \nD. Acosta   Decides   on   a   Resolution   That   Includes   a   Two-Year   Term   of   \nIncarceration \n The next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment.  Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would \naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with \nthe  result  that  the  defense  continued  to  chip  away  at  it  as  the  negotiations  continued.    The  \ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years \nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able \nto recall how the decision was made.  As discussed below, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation, \nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.\n76\n      \n  While  the  defense  was  communicating  its  objections  to  the  federal  investigation  to  \nVillafaña, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafaña continued moving toward filing charges.  On \nJuly  19,  2007,  the  day  after  receiving  Oosterbaan’s  email  supporting  a  potential  prosecution,  \nVillafaña  emailed  Lourie  and  Menchel  seeking  approval  to  take  further  investigative  steps  \nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants.  However, Menchel directed Villafaña to “hold off . . . until \nwe  decide  what  course  of  action  we  are  going  to  take  on  [E]pstein  which  should  happen  next  \nweek.”  Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafaña to wait, but \nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.   \n On Monday, July 23, 2007, Menchel submitted a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that \nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2007.\n77\n   \n1. The July 26, 2007 Meeting in Miami \nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2007, Villafaña informed Menchel that she was \npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all \nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt \nacts  and  counts  relating  to  two  additional  victims;  she  would  not,  however,  have  the  revised  \nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:00 p.m. meeting.  Menchel told OPR \nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafaña to \ndelay the investigative steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something” \nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed \nwith federal charges.  \n Acosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2007.  On that afternoon, Villafaña met in \nMiami  with  Menchel.    She  told  OPR  that  Sloman,  as  well  as  the  FBI  case  agents  and  their  \nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone.  Villafaña told OPR that \nshe  expected  that  the  meeting,  requested  by  Menchel,  would  address  the  direction  of  the  \ninvestigation.  However, Villafaña told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered \nthe  room  and  stated  that  Acosta  “has  decided  to  offer  a  two-year  state  deal.”    According  to  \n                                                 \n76\n  See Section IV.D.2 in this Part. \n77\n  As early as May 4, 2007, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter \nprivate practice.   \n\n \n49 \n \nVillafaña,  Menchel  left  the  meeting  after  almost  no  discussion,  leaving  Villafaña  “shocked  and  \nstunned.”   \nMenchel  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  recall  the  July  26,  2007  meeting.    Nonetheless,  he  \nstrongly disputed Villafaña’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at \nodds  with  his  management  style”  to  convene  such  a  meeting,  announce  Acosta’s  decision,  and  \nleave without discussion.  Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at \nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision \nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s \nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to \ndo so.  Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting.  The FBI case agent recalled attending a \nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafaña, \nLourie  (by  telephone),  Menchel,  and  Sloman,  at  which  they  discussed  how  to  proceed  with  the  \nEpstein  case.    According  to  the  case  agent,  at  this  meeting  the  FBI  insisted  that  Epstein  be  \nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court \nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.   \nRegardless   of   exactly   how   Acosta’s   decision   regarding   the   two-year   term   was   \ncommunicated  to  Villafaña  and  the  FBI  agents,  and  regardless  of  who  initially  proposed  the  \nspecific  term,  the  record  shows  that  Acosta  ultimately  made  the  decision  to  offer  Epstein  a  \nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknowledged.\n78\n   \n2. The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence \nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration \nVillafaña asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the \ndecision was made.\n79\n  Villafaña told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and \nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view, \nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also told OPR that \nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2007 meeting, and Villafaña \ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.  \nVillafaña described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines \npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines.  There’s no way to get \nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”\n80\n   \n                                                 \n78\n  OPR notes that Villafaña did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors setting forth her views and \nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made \nto offer a two-year term of incarceration.  Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and \nVillafaña, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a \ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting. \n79\n    OPR  found  no  evidence  in  the  documentary  record  indicating  that  Villafaña  had  knowledge  of  Acosta’s  \ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2007 meeting at which she said she learned of it.       \n80\n From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in 1987, they have been the mechanism for \ncalculating federal criminal sentences.  Since 2005, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are \nrequired to consider them.  As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.710, \n\n \n50 \n \nSloman also told OPR that he did not know how the decision to offer a two-year plea offer \nwas  reached,  but  he  believed  that  Acosta  made  the  decision  based  on  recommendations  from  \nMenchel,  Lourie,  and  Villafaña.    He  opined  to  OPR  that  the  decision  was  likely  based  on  an  \nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.\n81\n  Sloman added \nthat he did not know how a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either \nstate or federal sentencing guidelines.  Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall how the two-year \nterm  was  decided  upon,  or  by  whom,  but  he  speculated  that  it  may  have  been  presented  by  the  \ndefense  as  the  most  Epstein  would  accept,  and  that  the  decision  would  have  been  reached  by  \nAcosta  following  “extended  consideration,  research,  and  discussion,”  among  Acosta,  Sloman,  \nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.\n82\n \n  Menchel  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  recall  discussing  a  two-year  plea  deal  with  Acosta  or  \nwho  reached  the  decision  that  two  years  was  an  appropriate  sentence.    Menchel  also  told  OPR,  \nhowever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges, \nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take \nthe case to trial.  Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial, \nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to \ntestify.  Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as \na fair result in terms of the conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not \nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have \ngotten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.” \n  Acosta  told  OPR  that  “I  had  decided  and  endorsed”  the  two-year  resolution  “at  some  \npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a \nweek or two.”  As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely \nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[, \n‘]encouraging  the  state  to  do  a  little  bit  more.[’]”\n83\n    Acosta  said  that  he  understood  two  years’  \nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the \nPBPD  was  considering  at  the  outset  of  the  state  investigation.\n84\n    Acosta  also  told  OPR  that  he  \n                                                 \nthe attorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in \nits determination of the sentence to be imposed.  The prosecutor must be familiar \nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable \nto his or her case.  In discharging these duties, the attorney for the government \nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information \nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based. \n81\n  In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.   \n82\n    Lourie  noted  that  Sloman  and  Menchel  were  “two  extraordinarily  experienced  people  in  [Acosta’s]  front  \noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”    \n83\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a little \nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case.  Acosta’s attorney \nalso  asserted  that  the  phrase  was  “clearly  soft-spoken  understatement,”  that  the  terms  obtained  were  “substantially  \nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the \nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”      \n84\n    OPR  examined  this  assertion  and  was  unable  to  verify  that  the  proposed  two-year  term  of  imprisonment  \ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in \n\n \n51 \n \nunderstood  that  the  PBPD  would  not  have  asked  the  FBI  to  investigate  Epstein  if  the  state  had  \npursued the appropriate charges.  In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly, \nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what \nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.”  Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his \nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific \nconversation with them. \nE. Villafaña  Drafts  a  “Term  Sheet”  Listing  the  Requirements  of  a  Potential  \nAgreement with the Defense \nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 31, 2007.  Villafaña told \nOPR  that  between  July  26  and  July  30,  2007,  she  had  “some  sort  of  discussion”  with  her  \nsupervisors  that  resulted  in  her  creation  of  a  “term  sheet”  identifying  the  proposed  terms  for  \nresolving the federal investigation through state charges.  Sometime during that period, Villafaña \nleft  a  voicemail  message  for  Menchel.    During  their  OPR  interviews,  neither  Villafaña  nor  \nMenchel could recall what Villafaña said in that message.  On July 30, 2007, Menchel emailed \nVillafaña: \nI received your voicemail this morning.  I don’t see any reason to \nchange  our  approach.    I  think  telling  them  that  unless  the  state  \nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and \nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys \nthat  we  are  serious.    While  Lilly  [Sanchez]  has  represented  in  the  \npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite \nthese terms before.  In any event, this is the course of action that the \nUS Attorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.   \nThe  following  day,  July  31,  2007,  Villafaña  emailed  a  one-page  “Terms  of  Epstein  \nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie.  Villafaña told OPR she had never \nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign” \nto her.\n85\n  Villafaña told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein \n                                                 \nthe state indictment.  OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found \nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.   \n85\n  Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for \nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities.  A 2008 Departmental memorandum explained:  \nThe  terms  “deferred  prosecution  agreement”  and  “non-prosecution  agreement”  \nhave  often  been  used  loosely  by  prosecutors,  defense  counsel,  courts  and  \ncommentators.   As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution \nof   Business   Organizations],   a   deferred   prosecution   agreement   is   typically   \npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and \nthe  agreement  is  filed  with  the  appropriate  court.    In  the  non-prosecution  \nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained \nby  the  parties  rather  than  being  filed  with  a  court.    Clear  and  consistent  use  of  \nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best \npractices and to track the use of such agreements.  These Principles do not apply \n\n \n52 \n \nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated \nthat  terminology  to  her.    According  to  Villafaña,  she  asked  that  it  include  a  mechanism  for  the  \nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution \nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.\n86\n  Acosta told \nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”   \nBefore  the  document  was  presented  to  defense  counsel,  two  terms  were  dropped  from  \nVillafaña’s  draft—one  providing  that  the  agreement  would  apply  only  to  already-identified  \nvictims,  and  another  requiring  the  deal  to  be  accepted,  and  Epstein  to  plead  guilty,  within  the  \nmonth.  The final term sheet was as follows: \n                                                 \nto  plea  agreements,  which  involve  the  formal  conviction  of  a  corporation  in  a  \ncourt proceeding.   \nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Attorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and \nUnited  States  Attorneys  at  n.2  (Mar.  7,  2008),  available  at\n https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-\nmanual-163-selection-and-use-monitors.  Villafaña did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.  \n86\n    A  civil  remedy  for  personal  injuries  suffered  by  victims  of  certain  crimes  is  provided  for  in  the  federal  \ncriminal  code  at  18  U.S.C.  §  2255.    Subsection  (a)  of  the  statute,  as  in  effect  from  July  27,  2006,  to    \nMarch 6, 2013, provided as follows:  \nAny  person  who,  while  a  minor,  was  a  victim  of  a  violation  of  section  \n2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422,  or  2423 of \nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless \nof  whether  the  injury  occurred  while  such  person  was  a  minor,  may  sue  in  any  \nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such \nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.  Any \nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained \ndamages of no less than $150,000 in value.   \nVillafaña also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that \nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; however, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3, \n2007 email to Villafaña recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.   \n\n53\nV.THE  USAO  PRESENTS  EPSTEIN  WITH  KEY  TERMS  OF  A  DEAL:   PLEAD  \nGUILTY   TO   STATE   CHARGES   REQUIRING   A   TWO-YEAR   TERM   OF   \nINCARCERATION AND SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION, AND AGREE \nTO A MEANS FOR THE VICTIMS TO OBTAIN MONETARY DAMAGES\nAlthough the USAO term sheet was presented to Epstein’s defense team on July 31, 2007, \nit  took  almost  another  two  months  to  reach  a  final  agreement  in  the  form  of  the  NPA.    The  \ncontemporaneous emails show that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered \nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the \nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement.  The emails make clear \nthat  as  the  negotiations  intensified  in  September  2007,  the  prosecutors  became  increasingly  \nfrustrated,  particularly  with  what  they  perceived  as  the  defense  tactic  of  agreeing  to  terms  and  \nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.  \nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning \nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS \nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT \n■ Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Infonnation filed by the \nPalm Beach County State Attorney's Office charging him with: \n(a) lewd and la scivious batte1y  on a child, in v iolation \nof Fl. Stat. \n800.04(4); \n(b) solicitation \nof minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Fl. \nStat. 796.03; and \n(c) engaging in sexual activity with minors at least sixteen ye\nars of age, \nin violation of Fl. Stat. 794.05. \n■ Epstein and the State Attorney's Office make a joint, binding \nrecomm endation  that Epstein serve at least two years in priso\nn. without any \nopportunity for withholding adjudication \nor sentencing; and without \nprobation \nor community control in lieu of imprisonment. \n■ Epstein agrees to waive all challenges to the information filed by the State \na\nnd the right to appeal. \n■ Epstein agrees that. if any of the v ictims identified in the federal \ninvestigation file \nsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest \nthe jurisdiction \nof the U.S . District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida over his person and the subject matter. Epstein will not contest that \nthe identified victims are persons who, \nwhile minors, were victims of \nviolations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422 ancVor 2423. \n■ After Epstein enters his state court plea and is sentenced, the FBI and the \nU.S. Attorney' s Office \nwill close their investigations. \n\n \n54 \n \nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two \nyears in prison.”  The USAO did, however, consistently reject defense proposals to change other \nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.     \nA. July 31, 2007:  The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which \nMakes a Counteroffer \nMenchel,  Sloman,  Lourie,  Villafaña,  and  the  case  agents  met  with  Epstein  attorneys  \nLefcourt,  Sanchez,  and  Black  on  July  31,  2007,  with  Menchel  “leading  the  meeting”  for  the  \nUSAO.\n87\n      The  USAO  presented  the  term  sheet,  and  Villafaña  distributed  a  federal  sentencing  \nguidelines  calculation  showing  that  if  prosecuted  federally,  Epstein  faced  a  sentencing  range  of  \n188 to 235 months’ incarceration.    \nVillafaña recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s attorneys opposed the requirement of \nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein \nserve  a  sentence  of  home  confinement  or  “community  control”\n88\n  in  lieu  of  incarceration,  and  \nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.\n89\n  Villafaña told OPR \nthat when Epstein’s attorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a \nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a \nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility.  A few days after the meeting, \nVillafaña emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-1/2 \nyear cap.”   \nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence \nshow  that  during  the  negotiations,  the  parties  also  considered  structuring  a  plea  around  federal  \n                                                 \n87\n  Villafaña was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting. \n88\n  According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control, \nThe  Community  Control  supervision  program  was  created  as  a  diversion  to  \nincarceration  or  imprisonment;  therefore  it  is  an  intensive  supervision  program  \nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, attending school, \nperforming  public  service  hours,  participating  in  treatment  or  another  special  \nactivity  that  has  been  approved  in  advance  by  your  officer.  The  program  was  \ndesigned  to  build  accountability  and  responsibility  along  with  providing  a  \npunishment   alternative   to   imprisonment.   While   on   Community   Control   \nsupervision (also known as “house arrest”) you will not be allowed to leave your \nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation, \nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do . . . , but it does \nallow you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or attend school \nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.  \nFlorida   Dept.   of   Corrections,   Succeeding   on   Community   Control   at   1,   http://www.dc.state.fl.us/cc/ccforms/   \nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf. \n89\n  Villafaña told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of \nexperience with the state system.  We did not.”  Villafaña anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state \nsentence  and  the  USAO  would  be  “giving  up  all  control,”  and  she  told  OPR  that  she  discussed  this  concern  with  \nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.   \n\n \n55 \n \ncharges in addition to state charges.  On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez followed up on the \nJuly 31, 2007 meeting with an August 2, 2007 letter to Menchel:  \nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither \nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the \nstate  prison  system  pose  risks  that  are  clearly  untenable.    We  \nacknowledge   that   your   suggestion   of   a   plea   to   two   federal   \nmisdemeanors  was  an  attempt  to  resolve  this  dilemma.    Our  \nproposal  is  significantly  punitive,  and  if  implemented,  would,  we  \nbelieve, leave little doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably \nvindicated.\n90\n \nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never \nbeen arrested before.  He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”   \nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense letter involved no period of \nmandatory incarceration.  Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular \nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court \nand  probationary  costs,  and  law  enforcement  costs;  random  drug  testing;  community  service;  \npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims.  The letter \nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed \nunder  18  U.S.C.  §  2255  and  represented  that  Epstein  was  “prepared  to  fully  fund  the  identified  \ngroup  of  victims  which  are  the  focus  of  the  [USAO]  –  that  is,  the  12  individuals  noted  at  the  \nmeeting on July 31, 2007.”  Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only \nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.  Sanchez also advised that the defense \nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta. \nB. In  an  August  3,  2007  Letter,  the  USAO  States  That  a  Two-Year  Term  of  \nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest \n Villafaña told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable, \nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response.  Villafaña drafted for \nMenchel’s signature a letter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment \nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.  \nVillafaña’s  draft  stated  that  the  USAO  “has  never  agreed  that  a  state  prison  sentence  is  not  \nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allow Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal \nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation \nfor a two-year term of incarceration.  Villafaña specified that Epstein would also be required to \nconcede  liability  under  18  U.S.C.  §  2255  for  all  of  the  victims  identified  during  the  federal  \ninvestigation, “not just the 12 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”   \n                                                 \n90\n  The USAO countered, however, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that \n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.”  Records show that throughout the \nEpstein  matter,  the  USAO  attorneys  identified  instances  when  defense  attorneys  misstated  or  otherwise  did  not  \naccurately describe events or statements.  Accordingly, in evaluating the subject attorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely \non uncorroborated defense assertions. \n\n \n56 \n \n Menchel made several substantive changes to Villafaña’s draft letter.  He specified that “a \ntwo-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal \ninterest in the case.  (Emphasis added.)  With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote \nthat the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the reference to a \nRule 11(c) plea.  Menchel also removed the reference to the specific state offenses to which Epstein \nwould be required to plead guilty.  Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they \nspeak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña. \n The final letter, as shown on the following pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except \nthat it omitted all reference to a federal plea under Rule 11(c).\n91\n \n  \n                                                 \n91\n  Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule 11(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges \nwere generally averse to them.  He did not recall why the provision was dropped from the letter, but “assumed” it was \na decision by Acosta.  In a September 6, 2007 email, Villafaña told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a \nRule 11(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña told OPR \nthat Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule 11(c) plea.      \n\n57\nR.

TtkpltOM \n(JOJ) SJl-6'\". FoaUlllk \nAugust 3, 2007 \nThan.le you for your letter of August 2'' regarding your proposal on how to resolve the \nEpstein matter. \nAs we explained at our meeting on July 3 1, 2007, the Office believes thatthe federa l \ninterest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state imprisonment for \nMr. Epstein.  That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is th.e minimum \nterm \nof imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has \nnever agreed that a  state \nprison sentence is not appropriate for Mr.  Epstein.   Rather we \nsimply \nstated that if Mr. Epstein preferred to serve hi s s  entence in a federal pcnctcntiary, we \nwould \nbe w:illing to explore a  federal conviction that may allow that in lieu of any state \nresolution. Further, as I  made clear in our follow up telephone conversation after the \nmeeting, a \nplea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer. \nWe also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all \nof \nthe minor girls identified during the federal investigation, not j ust the 12 that form the basis \nof an initial p lanned charging instrument \nAs you know, th e  ability to engage \nin flexible  plea negotiations is  drnmatically \nchanged upon the return \nof an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does \nttot intend to file a Superseding Information containing a les\nser charge or to di smiss the case \nin favor of state prosecution. \n\n58\nMenchel  told  OPR  that  in  his  view,  the  two-year  sentence  established  a  “floor”  for  \nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more \njail time rather than less.  Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by \nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him \ninto  a  federal  penitentiary.”    The  letter’s  deadline  of  August  17,  2007,  for  acceptance  of  the  \ngovernment’s  offer  was  intended  to  accommodate  Villafaña’s  request  that  the  deadline  provide  \nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s \nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if \nEpstein rejected the deal.  Menchel told OPR he considered August 17 to be a firm deadline:  “[I]f \nyou  tell  someone  they  have  two  weeks,  it  should  be  two  weeks.”    Menchel  signed  and  sent  the  \nletter on Friday, August 3, 2007, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law \nfirm.\n92\nThe following Monday, August 6, 2007, Villafaña contacted Menchel by email at his new \nfirm to inquire whether the letter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.  Villafaña explained \n92\nMenchel told OPR that the timing of the letter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do \nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\nLILLY A DEZ, ESQ. \nAUGUST 3, 2007 \nPAG 2 \nPlease let us know yourclieat's decis·oa byno later than August l 7. l hav,e oopfcrttd \nw:ith U.S ..

Because . . . if the letter didn’t go \nout we can make this all go away and restart.”  Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the letter \nout by email.   \nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood \nEpstein  had  rejected  the  USAO’s  proposal,  and  he  asked  when  Epstein  would  be  charged.    \nVillafaña told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not \nto  prosecute  Epstein  federally.    Sloman  similarly  told  OPR  that  the  squad  supervisor  “like  \n[Villafaña] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n93\n \nC. August  –  September  2007:    Epstein  Hires  Additional  Attorneys,  Who  Meet  \nwith Acosta \n1. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Attorneys  \n Villafaña told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with \nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer.  Around this time, \nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkowitz, two prominent attorneys from the law \nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate \nat the firm.\n94\n  On the evening of August 6, 2007, Sloman emailed Acosta:  “Just saw Menchel.  I \ndidn’t know Kirkland made a call into you.  You were right.  Unbelievable.”  During their OPR \ninterviews,  neither  Acosta  nor  Sloman  remembered  the  call  from  Kirkland  &  Ellis  and  could  \nprovide  no  additional  information  about  the  contact.\n95\n    A  reply  email  from  Acosta  to  Sloman  \nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys were considering elevating to the Department their \nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein matter.  In that email, Acosta stated, “They \nare likely to go to DC.  We should strategize a bit.  We are not changing positions, and that should \nbe made clear.”   \nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman: \n[Epstein’s] attorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds \nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.  I’m concerned \nthat this will delay matters. \nI am thinking of heading this off, by (i) agreeing to meet to discuss \ngeneral legal policy only (the only matter in which DC has arguable \n                                                 \n93\n  In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s \na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.”  The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not \nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the \ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict?  Why don’t we just move forward?”   \n94\n  Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September 1995 to March 1997, he \nhad  worked  on  at  least  one  matter  each  with  Starr  and  Lefkowitz,  and  since  that  time,  he  had  professional  \nacquaintanceships with both.   \n95\n  Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which \nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,” \nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.   \n\n \n60 \n \njurisdiction),  while  making  clear  that  we  are  not  talking  about  the  \ndetails  of  the  case,  and  (ii)  asking  [CEOS  Chief]  Oosterba[an]  to  \nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting. \nThoughts? \nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and \nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop \nthis case.”\n96\n \n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are \nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaña’s Efforts to \nObtain the Computer Evidence \n On August 8, 2007, Villafaña informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterbaan, who \nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after \nAugust  21,  he  was  willing  to  participate  by  phone  in  order  “to  stay  firm  on  our  August  17th  \ndeadline.”  Villafaña also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York \nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there.  Noting that “there was \nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a \nplea,” Villafaña asked Acosta for guidance.  Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that \nthe  USAO  “stick  to  our  deadline  if  possible.”    Lourie  pointed  out  that  CEOS  “has  no  approval  \nauthority”  and  opined  it  was  “a  bit  extreme  to  allow  the  defense  to  keep  arguing  this  [case]  to  \ndifferent agencies.”  Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhow, if we don’t \nmeet with them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so.  If our \ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.” \n As a result, the investigative steps were postponed.  On August 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed \nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could \noppose  Black’s  request  to  stay  the  litigation  concerning  the  government’s  efforts  to  obtain  \nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team.  Villafaña was \nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl \nwho began seeing Epstein at age 14 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.  \nOn August 13, 2007, Villafaña advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of \nthe  litigation.    However,  Sanchez  reached  out  to  Lourie  on  August  22,  2007,  and  obtained  his  \nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel, \nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2007.    \n  Villafaña  told  OPR  that,  in  her  opinion,  the  defense  efforts  to  put  off  the  litigation  \nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”\n97\n   Villafaña \nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”  \n                                                 \n96\n  In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the \nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the \ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the matter.   \n97\n  Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist \n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”   \n\n \n61 \n \nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating \nposition,  but  that  her  supervisors  “did  not  seem  to  recognize  that.”    Villafaña  said  she  did  not  \nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.  \nInstead,  they  instructed  Villafaña  to  “keep  calling  the  judge”  to  ask  for  a  delay  in  the  litigation  \nproceedings.  \nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what \nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafaña was “ordered to stand \ndown.”    Acosta,  Menchel,  and  Lourie  all  told  OPR  that  they  did  not  recall  Villafaña’s  effort  to  \nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it.  Lourie, however, told \nOPR that the computers might have contained “very powerful evidence” that possibly “could have \nchanged  our  advice  to  [Acosta],  or  his  decision  making.”    In  his  OPR  interview,  Menchel  was  \nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknowledged to OPR, \n“You always want more as a prosecutor.” \n  On  August  31,  2007,  in  preparation  for  the  upcoming  September  7,  2007  meeting  with  \ndefense counsel that he planned to attend, CEOS Chief Oosterbaan traveled to West Palm Beach \nto meet with Villafaña and the case agents and to examine the case file.  He explained to OPR that \nhe  wanted  to  see  the  file  before  meeting  with  the  defense  so  that  he  could  best  “represent[]  the  \ninterests  of  the  prosecution  team,”  and  that  he  was  in  favor  of  going  forward  with  the  case.    \nAccording to Villafaña, during his review of the file, Oosterbaan told her that the case was “really \ngood” and offered to assist Villafaña at trial.   \n  On  September  6,  2007,  the  day  before  the  meeting  with  defense  counsel,  Sloman  sent  \nVillafaña  an  email  asking,  “Please  refresh  my  recollection.    What  is  the  ‘deal’  on  the  table?”    \nSloman  told  OPR  that  his  question  reflected  the  fact  that  in  his  capacity  as  FAUSA,  he  was  \ninvolved  in  “a  hundred  other  things”  at  that  time.\n98\n    Villafaña  sent  Sloman  the  term  sheet  and  \nexplained to him, “You and Matt [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an \nInformation charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think Matt \nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.”  Villafaña continued: \nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow.  First, \nthat  there  is  an  absolute  drop-dead  date  for  accepting  or  rejecting  \nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of \nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th.  Second, the agents \nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which \nas  Drew  [Oosterbaan]  politely  reminded  me,  is  required  under  the  \nlaw.  And third, I do not want to make any promises about allowing \nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good \nchance of getting him detained.\n99\n \n                                                 \n98\n  Sloman noted that with the attention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only \ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”   \n99\n  As Villafaña explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government \nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond.  Contrary to Villafaña’s assertion in the email, \nthe  CVRA,  even  when  applicable,  required  only  victim  consultation,  not  victim  approval,  and  as  is  explained  in  \n\n \n62 \n \nVillafaña  added  that  the  PBPD  Chief  had  alerted  the  FBI  that  an  upcoming  news  article  would  \nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to know if \nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.”  Sloman forwarded Villafaña’s email to Acosta \nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”   \nLater that evening, Villafaña circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterbaan two alternative \ndocuments:  a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.\n100\n  The draft federal plea agreement, \nfollowing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy \nunder 18 U.S.C. § 371 to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration \nas a sexual offender, with a Rule 11(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment.  The draft \nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 31, 2007, and called for Epstein to \nenter a state plea by September 28, 2007.  Villafaña told OPR that because she had never seen a \nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the \nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the \nuse of non-prosecution agreements.\n101\n \n3. September   7,   2007:      Acosta,   Other   USAO   Attorneys,   and   FBI   \nSupervisors   Meet   with   Epstein   Attorneys   Starr,   Lefkowitz,   and   \nSanchez \nOn  Friday,  September  7,  2007,  Acosta,  Sloman,  Villafaña,  Villafaña’s  co-counsel,  \nOosterbaan, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office \nwith defense attorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkowitz.\n102\n  This was Acosta’s \nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team.  Villafaña understood the purpose of this meeting was \nto  afford  Epstein’s  counsel  an  opportunity  to  “make  a  pitch”  as  to  why  the  case  should  not  be  \nprosecuted  federally.    Villafaña  recalled  that  at  a  “pre-meet”  before  defense  counsel  arrived,  \nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case. \n Acosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to \npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism.  Villafaña \nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case \nshould  remain  a  state  matter  in  which  the  USAO  should  not  interfere.    Both  Villafaña  and  her  \nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held \nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the \nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.”  Acosta did \nnot  recall  the  comment,  but  he  told  OPR,  “[B]ack  in  July,  we  had  decided  that  we  were  going  \n                                                 \nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in matters in which \nthe  government  did  not  pursue  a  federal  charge.    The  USAO’s  actions  with  respect  to  victim  consultation  and  the  \nDepartment’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.         \n100\n The initial draft NPA is attached as Exhibit 2 to this Report. \n101\n  OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied. \n102\n  Lourie was not present.  During September 2007, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C., \nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff to the head \nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher.  He served in that detail until he left \nthe Department in February 2008.  \n\n \n63 \n \nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.  \nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”\n103\n \n  Villafaña  told  OPR  that  after  hearing  the  defense  argument,  Acosta  reiterated  that  the  \nfederal  interest  in  the  case  could  be  vindicated  only  by  a  state  plea  to  an  offense  that  required  \nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the \n18  U.S.C.  §  2255  process  for  providing  compensation  to  the  victims.    When  defense  counsel  \nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal \nfor  a  sentence  of  home  confinement.    In  a  subsequent  email  exchange  with  Criminal  Division  \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterbaan reported \nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might \napproach  Criminal  Division  Assistant  Attorney  General  Alice  Fisher  to  present  that  argument  \ndirectly to her.  \nVI. SEPTEMBER  2007:    THE  PLEA  NEGOTIATIONS  INTENSIFY,  AND  IN  THE  \nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED  \n  Acosta  had  dispensed  with  the  August  17,  2007  plea  deadline  specified  in  Menchel’s  \nAugust  3,  2007  letter,  in  order  to  allow  the  defense  to  meet  with  him.\n \n  After  that  meeting,  and  \nalthough Villafaña continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was \nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.   \nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions.  Because Acosta was \nnot  willing  to  compromise  on  the  issue  of  sexual  offender  registration  or  providing  a  means  \nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of \nimprisonment.  As the contemporaneous emails show, the USAO did not hold to its position that \na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept.  To reach an \nagreement  with  the  defense  on  Epstein’s  sentence,  the  USAO  explored  possible  pleas  in  either  \nfederal  or  state  court,  or  both,  and  Villafaña  spent  considerable  time  and  effort  working  with  \ndefense  counsel  on  developing  alternative  pleas  with  various  outcomes.    In  the  course  of  that  \nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of 18 months, with \nthe  understanding  that  under  the  state’s  sentencing  procedures,  he  would  likely  serve  just  15  \nmonths.      \nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months \nShortly after the September 7, 2007 meeting, Epstein attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had \nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer, \nproposing that Epstein serve 15 months in jail followed by 15 months in home confinement.  On \nthe afternoon of Monday, September 10, 2007, Villafaña emailed Sloman, identifying issues she \nwanted  to  discuss  with  him,  including  her  concern  that  defense  counsel  was  pushing  for  a  \nresolution  that  would  allow  Epstein  to  avoid  incarceration  and  possibly  sexual  offender  \nregistration.  Villafaña stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light \nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really low sentence.”  Villafaña \n                                                 \n103\n  Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the \nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.   \n\n \n64 \n \nnoted that the revised charges involved 19 victims, so the defense proposal for a 15-month sentence \namounted to less than one month per victim.  Villafaña requested that “whatever the U.S. Attorney \ndecides  to  do,”  the  agreement  with  Epstein  should  “follow  .  .  .  a  version  of  my  written  non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a \nstrict timeline.” \n Later that day, Villafaña circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a \n20-month jail sentence to be followed by 10 months of home confinement.  This redrafted NPA \ncontained  a  provision  that  specified,  “With  credit  for  gain  time,  Epstein  shall  serve  at  least    \n17 months in a state correctional institution.”\n104\n  Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended \nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with \nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.”  Villafaña sent her version of the \nrevised  NPA  to  Lefcourt  that  afternoon  and  forwarded  Acosta’s  proposed  change  to  him  the  \nfollowing day, after she learned of it.    \n On September 11, 2007, the court contacted Villafaña to inquire whether the USAO would \nbe  prepared  to  proceed  with  the  litigation  concerning  the  computers  the  following  day.    At  \nSloman’s direction, Villafaña asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for \nthe  following  week.    At  the  same  time,  anticipating  that  plea  negotiations  would  fail,  Villafaña  \ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterbaan, seeking their feedback before \nsending it “through the chain of command.”  Villafaña also sent Oosterbaan the revised NPA and \ntold  him  she  was  “still  shooting  for  9/25”  to  bring  charges,  assuming  the  defense  declined  the  \nUSAO’s  offer.    Oosterbaan  responded,  “The  counter-offering  is  unfortunate,  but  I  suppose  it’s  \nunderstandable.”\n105\n   \n That afternoon, Lourie asked Villafaña, “What is our latest offer?”  Villafaña responded, \n“Plead  to  the  three  specified  [state]  charges,  a  30-month  sentence,  split  20  in  jail  and  10  in  \n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.  We also put in \ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”    \nB. September  12,  2007:    The  USAO  and  Defense  Counsel  Meet  with  the  State  \nAttorney \n  Although  the  USAO  and  defense  counsel  had  been  discussing  resolving  the  federal  \ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State \nAttorney’s Office in those discussions until September 12, 2007.  On that day, Lourie, Villafaña, \nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West \nPalm  Beach  office,  and  Epstein  attorneys  Lefkowitz,  Lefcourt,  and  Goldberger  met  with  State  \nAttorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek.  Other than Villafaña, \nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it.  The available evidence \nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.   \n                                                 \n104\n  Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.   \n105\n  Oosterbaan told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement \nwith it.”   \n\n \n65 \n \nVillafaña told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did \nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek.  Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed \nconcern  about  proceeding  as  the  USAO  was  proposing.    According  to  Villafaña,  Belohlavek  \nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s \nsentencing  guidelines,  and  that  it  would  be  better  for  the  guidelines  calculation  if  Epstein  pled  \nguilty  to  just  one  of  the  three  counts.    Villafaña  recalled  that  when  Belohlavek  confirmed  that  \nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges, \nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allow Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge \nin  addition  to  the  pending  state  indictment,  and  the  defense  attorneys  selected  the  charge  of  \nprocurement  of  minors  to  engage  in  prostitution.\n106\n    Lourie,  however,  disputed  Villafaña’s  \nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had \nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally.\n107\n   \nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state \nprison.  Villafaña also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the \nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during \nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local \nfacility.    Belohlavek  explained  to  OPR  that  in  order  for  Epstein  to  serve  his  time  in  a  county  \nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than 12 months, so \nthat, for example, consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months—totaling 18 months—could be \nserved in the county jail.  Villafaña told OPR: \nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day.  So during this meeting, \nI remember [the defense] talking about . . . a one year count followed \nby  a  six-month  count  .  .  .  that  [Epstein]  could  serve  them  back  to  \nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.  \nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round \nthe  clock  incarceration.”    And  Barry  Krischer  said  yes.    And  [he]  \nsaid  that  to  avoid  [Epstein  being  extorted  while  incarcerated],  he  \nwould be kept in solitary confinement. \nVillafaña  did  not  recall  whether  she  and  Lourie  agreed  to  an  18-month  sentence  during  that  \nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allowing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county \njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.   \nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details \nof the September 12, 2007 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember \nthe meeting at all.  Krischer did, however, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned \nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment \nand  an  additional  charge  requiring  sexual  offender  registration,  explaining  to  OPR  that  Epstein  \n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was \n                                                 \n106\n    Later,  the  defense  would  claim  that  they  had  mistakenly  understood  that  the  selected  charge  would  not  \ninvolve sexual offender registration.   \n107\n  As noted below, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafaña spoke \nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement. \n\n \n66 \n \ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he \nhadn’t done up to this point.”  Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that down?”  Krischer also noted \nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that \n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”\n108\n       \nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September 12 \nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only \none charge.  Acosta told OPR, however, that he recognized that Villafaña and Lourie needed “some \ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose \na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein \nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.     \n            Although            Epstein’s            attorneys            expressed  interest  in  Epstein  serving  his  time  in  a  county  \nfacility  (rather  than  state  prison),  one  of  Epstein’s  attorneys  alternatively  expressed  interest  in  \nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state \nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence \nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.  \nLater  that  day,  Villafaña  sent  Lefkowitz  an  email  advising  that  she  and  Lourie  had  talked  with  \nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”\n109\n  The next day, \nSeptember 13, 2007, Villafaña sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors, \nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence.  Villafaña also emailed \ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title 18”—referring \nto  the  code  of  federal  criminal  statutes—to  make  sure  there  would  be  a  “factual  basis”  for  any  \nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.   \nC. The  Evidence  Does  Not  Clearly  Show  Why  the  Term  of  Incarceration  Was  \nReduced from 24 Months to 20 Months to 18 Months \nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafaña, and Lourie to \nexplain how the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to 18 \nmonths.  Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was \nreduced.  Villafaña and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.   \nVillafaña told OPR:   \nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it \ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it \ngoing to be a federal charge?  And to get to a federal charge, there \nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense.  So somehow it \nended  up  being  20  months  and  then  it  got  to  be  18  months.    And  \nthese  were  calls  that  if  I  remember  correctly,  Jay  Lefkowitz  was  \n                                                 \n108\n  Belohlavek, however, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated \nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.  \n109\n  The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”  \n\n \n67 \n \nhaving  directly  with  Alex  Acosta,  and  Alex  Acosta  agreed  to  18  \nmonths. \nVillafaña further explained to OPR: \nRegarding going from 24 months to 20 months, I recall a discussion \nthat 24 months of federal time was really 20 months after gain time, \nso  Epstein  should  be  allowed  to  plead  to  20  months’  in  the  state.    \nEpstein’s  counsel  represented  that  he  wouldn’t  get  gain  time  like  \nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed.  Later, of course, \nas shown in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkowitz) got \nAlex to agree that Epstein should be allowed to earn gain time in the \n[s]tate, so the 20 months in the state became at least 17 months.   \nRegarding going from 20 months’ to 18 months, . . . this came from \na  negotiation  between  Epstein’s  counsel  and  Andy  or  Alex  where  \nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or 18, so 18 was agreed \nto.    I  also  recall  that,  after  Epstein’s  counsel  decided  that  they  \nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked \nAlex why we didn’t return to 20 months because the reason why we \nwent to 18 months was because that was the only way to end up with \na federal statutory maximum.\n110\n \n  However,  a  subsequent  account  of  the  history  of  negotiations  with  Epstein’s  attorneys,  \ndrafted by Villafaña for Acosta several weeks after the September 12, 2007 meeting with the State \nAttorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction \nin the amount of jail time – from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months down to eighteen \nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.” \nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafaña was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing \nto  allow  her  the  discretion  to  reduce  the  amount  of  incarceration  time  without  him  “second-\nguessing” her.  Acosta acknowledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.” \nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, how, or by whom the \ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to 18 months.  It \nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allow \nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ attempts \nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater \nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges.  In the end, the evidence shows that \nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to 18 months, and the USAO \nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount \nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.   \n                                                 \n110\n  By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafaña referred to 12-month and 6-month misdemeanors.    \n\n \n68 \n \nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to \nFederal Charges \nDuring the remainder of September, Villafaña conducted plea negotiations and drafted the \nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz.  In a September 13, 2007 email to CEOS \nChief  Oosterbaan,  Villafaña  reported  that  the  plea  negotiations  were  “getting  fast  and  furious.”    \nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make \npayments  to  the  victims,  rather  than  having  the  victims  file  individual  §  2255  court  actions  for  \ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.” \n  According  to  the  email  documentation,  by  Friday,  September  14,  2007,  the  parties  had  \nmoved  toward  a  “hybrid”  federal  plea  agreement,  incorporating  a  plea  to  state  charges,  which  \nwould  allow  Epstein  to  serve  his  sentence  for  all  the  charges  concurrently  in  a  federal  prison.    \nVillafaña informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkowitz \nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges:  harassment to \nprevent  a  witness  from  reporting  a  crime  (18  U.S.C.  §  1512(d)(2),  which  was  then  a  one-year  \nmisdemeanor),   and   simple   assault   on   an   airplane   (18   U.S.C.   §   113(a)(5),   a   six-month   \nmisdemeanor).  Villafaña reported that Lefkowitz “put in a pitch for only 12 months, I put in a \npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 20-month recommendation, and we decided that we would \nbe stuck with the 18 months.”   \nLater that day, Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information \nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had \n“not yet been blessed” by them.  The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the \ntwo  federal  charges  for  which  the  parties  would  jointly  recommend  that  he  be  sentenced  to  the  \nstatutory maximum penalty of 18 months’ imprisonment followed by 2 years of supervised release, \nand  that  he  would  also  plead  guilty  to  the  state  registrable  offense  of  procurement  of  minors  to  \nengage  in  prostitution,  for  which  Epstein  and  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  would  make  a  joint,  \nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 20 months in prison followed by 10 \nmonths of community control (home confinement).  Although not specified in the draft agreement, \nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently.   In addition \nto  payment  of  restitution,  Epstein  would  not  oppose  jurisdiction  or  victim  status  for  any  of  the  \nvictims  identified  in  the  federal  investigation—at  that  point  specified  as  numbering  40—who  \nelected to file suit for damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  A guardian ad litem would be appointed \nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf. \nLourie, however, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal.  In response \nto  Villafaña’s  email  about  the  potential  federal  charges,  but  after  Villafaña  sent  the  proposal  to  \nLefkowitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of \nsilly.”\n111\n  Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault \ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.”  Acosta responded, “If we \nneed[,]  let’s  find  a  different  charge.”    On  Saturday,  September  15,  2007,  Villafaña  emailed  \nLefkowitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “gotten some negative reaction \n                                                 \n111\n  The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female \nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”     \n\n \n69 \n \nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.\n112\n  At \nthis  point,  Sloman  left  on  vacation,  and  he  informed  Acosta  and  Villafaña  that  in  his  absence  \nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.”  Lourie spent the following work week at his new post \nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone \nand email.\n \n \n In a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafaña informed Lefkowitz that she had drafted \na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal.  In that email, Villafaña \nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which \nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.”  This email received considerable attention 12 \nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of \nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims.  Villafaña, however, explained to OPR \nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy.  She told \nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into \nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity \nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens \nin Palm Beach.”     \n Lefkowitz responded to Villafaña with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid” \nplea  agreement,  in  a  document  entitled  “Agreement.”    Significantly,  this  defense  proposal  \nintroduced  two  new  provisions.    The  first  related  to  four  female  assistants  who  had  allegedly  \nfacilitated  Epstein  in  his  criminal  scheme.    The  defense  sought  a  government  promise  not  to  \nprosecute  them,  as  well  as  certain  other  unnamed  Epstein  employees,  and  a  promise  to  forego  \nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants: \nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also \nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might \notherwise  in  the  future  be  brought  against  [four  named  female  \nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate \nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal \ninvestigation  .  .  .  .  Further,  no  immigration  proceeding  will  be  \ninstituted  against  [two  named  female  assistants]  as  a  result  of  the  \nongoing investigation.  \nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers: \nEpstein’s  fulfilling  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Agreement  \nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested \nwitness  testimony  and/or  the  production  of  documents  and/or  \ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the \nAgreement.    Each  [legal  process]  will  be  withdrawn  upon  the  \nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable \n                                                 \n112\n  Villafaña told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring \nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a \ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.”  Records show her supervisors were aware that at times she \nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case. \n\n \n70 \n \nevidence of a violation of the agreement.  Epstein and his counsel \nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will \nbe  safeguarded  in  their  current  condition  by  Epstein’s  counsel  or  \ntheir  agents  until  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Agreement  are  \nfulfilled. \n Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had \nsuggested:  “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an 18-month sentence, \nor  pleas  to  state  charges  and  two  federal  obstruction-of-justice  charges.    Villafaña  also  told  \nLefkowitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy \nwith a Rule 11(c) binding recommendation for a 20-month sentence.  Villafaña explained: \nAs  to  timing,  it  is  my  understanding  that  Mr.  Epstein  needs  to  be  \nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but \nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his \nfederal time.  Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be \naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the \njudge  that  we  are  trying  to  create  federal  jurisdiction  for  prison  \npurposes.   \nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafaña suggested standard \nfederal  plea  agreement  language  regarding  the  resolution  of  all  criminal  liability,  “and  I  will  \nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes \nand  all  of  the  other  persons  that  we  could  charge.”    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  she  was  willing  to  \ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood \nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in \nprosecuting  those  individuals  if  Epstein  entered  a  plea.    Villafaña  told  OPR,  “[W]e  considered  \nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone \nelse.”  She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed \nindividuals,  and  no  one,  including  the  FBI  case  agents,  raised  that  concern.    Villafaña  also  told  \nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge” \nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct, \nthe  court  might  ask  for  more  information  about  that  conduct  and  inquire  why  it  had  not  been  \ncharged,  and  if  the  government  provided  such  information,  Epstein’s  attorneys  might  claim  the  \nagreement was breached.\n113\n   \nWith regard to immigration, Villafaña told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any \nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that \neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had committed fraud in connection with \ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status.  So there wasn’t any reason \n                                                 \n113\n  OPR understood Villafaña’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry \ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to \ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.  \n\n \n71 \n \nfor them to be deported.”\n114\n  As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of \nhaving  committed  crimes,  Villafaña  told  OPR  she  did  not  consider  her  role  as  seeking  removal  \napart from actual prosecution. \n Villafaña concluded her email to Lefkowitz by expressing disappointment that they were \nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work \non the agreement: \nCan   I   suggest   that   tomorrow   we   either   meet   live   or   via   \nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick \nphone  call,  to  hash  out  these  items?    I  was  hoping  to  work  only  a  \nhalf day tomorrow to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if \nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet.  If you want to meet \n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine.  I will make sure that I have \nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.\n115\n \nVillafaña told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkowitz away from the USAO because conducting \nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafaña wanted “to have a meeting where we sat down \nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel better if you \ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting. \n On the morning of Monday, September 17, 2007, the USAO supervisor who was taking \nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafaña for an update on \nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkowitz the previous \nafternoon.  Villafaña told the manager, “As you can see . . . there are a number of things in their \nlast draft that were unacceptable.  All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”   \nShortly thereafter, Villafaña alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just \nspoken with Lefkowitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning towards a plea to state charges under \na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkowitz “our last version of the \nNon-Prosecution  Agreement.”    Acosta  asked  that  Villafaña  “make  sure  they  know  it[’]s  only  a  \ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.”  Villafaña responded, \n“Absolutely.  There were a lot of problems with their last attempt.  They tried to re-open all the \nloopholes that I had sewn shut.”  Villafaña sent to Lefkowitz the draft NPA that she had provided \nto Lefcourt on September 11, 2007, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him] \nhaving to reinvent the wheel.”  She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations, \nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th \n[to bring charges] . . . , no matter what.”   \nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkowitz asked Villafaña to provide for his review a factual \nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f \n                                                 \n114\n  According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the \nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of \nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.   \n115\n  Lefkowitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.    \n\n \n72 \n \nwe  go  that  route,  would  you  intend  to  make  the  deferred  [sic]  prosecution  agreement  public?”    \nVillafaña replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly \naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part \nof our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request, \nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”\n116\n  Villafaña told \nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want \npeople to believe him to have committed a variety of crimes.”  As she explained to OPR, Villafaña \nbelieved  the  NPA  did  not  need  to  be  disclosed  in  its  entirety,  but  she  anticipated  notifying  the  \nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages. \nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges \n  Negotiations  continued  the  next  day,  Tuesday,  September  18,  2007.    Responding  to  \nVillafaña’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkowitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge \nwith a 12-month sentence, followed by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home \ndetention  and  two  years  of  state  probation,  with  the  first  six  months  of  the  state  sentence  to  be  \nserved under community control.  Villafaña replied, “I know that the U.S. Attorney will not go \nbelow  18  months  of  prison/jail  time  (and  I  would  strongly  oppose  the  suggestion).”    Shortly  \nthereafter, Villafaña emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager: \nHi all – I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with \nMr.  Epstein,  and  not  because  we  have  reached  a  resolution.    As  I  \nmentioned  yesterday,  I  spent  about  12  hours  over  the  weekend  \ndrafting   Informations,   changing   plea   agreements,   and   writing   \nfactual proffers.  I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from \nthem  yesterday,  which  never  arrived.    At  that  time,  they  were  \nleaning towards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the \ntime in state custody. \nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkowitz who asked about Epstein \npleading  to  two  twelve-month  federal  charges  with  half  of  his  jail  \ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.  I \ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest \nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible \nbecause  he  will  not  be  in  Zone  A  or  B.\n117\n    This  morning  Jay  \nLefkowitz  called  and  said  that  I  was  correct  but,  if  we  could  get  \nMr.  Epstein  down  to  14  months,  then  he  thought  he  would  be  \neligible. \nMy response:  have him plead to two separate Informations.  On the \nfirst one he gets 12 months’ imprisonment and on the second he gets \n                                                 \n116\n    FOIA  requires  disclosure  of  government  records  upon  request  unless  an  exemption  applies  permitting  the  \ngovernment to withhold the requested records.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552.  \n117\n  Sentences falling within Zones A or B of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines permit probation or confinement \nalternatives to imprisonment. \n\n \n73 \n \ntwelve  months,  with  six  served  in  home  confinement,  to  run  \nconsecutively. \nI  just  received  an  e-mail  asking  if  Mr.  Epstein  could  just  do  12  \nmonths imprisonment instead. \nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing \njail time.  I would like to send Jay Lefkowitz an e-mail stating that \nif  we  do  not  have  a  signed  agreement  by  tomorrow  at  5:00,  \nnegotiations will end.  I have selected tomorrow at 5:00 because it \ngives them enough time to really negotiate an agreement if they are \nserious  about  it,  and  if  not,  it  gives  me  one  day  before  the  Jewish  \nholiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday . . . [September 25] , when I \nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review \nthe indictment package. \nDo you concur? \nA  few  minutes  later,  the  incoming  West  Palm  Beach  manager  emailed  Lourie,  suggesting  that  \nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”\n118\n   \n Within moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafaña, reporting that he \nhad just spoken with Lefkowitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap) \nwith nonbinding recommendation for 18 months.  When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state \noffenses,  including  against  minor,  registrable,  and  then  take  one  year  house  arrest/community  \nconfinement.”  By reply email, Villafaña asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether \nthey spoke. \nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of \nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects \nApproximately  an  hour  after  Lourie’s  email  reporting  the  deal  he  had  reached  with  \nLefkowitz, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a revised draft plea agreement.  Despite the agreement Lourie \nbelieved he and Lefkowitz had reached that morning, Lefkowitz’s proposal would have resulted \nin a 16-month federal sentence followed by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of \nhome  detention.    Lefkowitz  also  inserted  a  statement  in  his  proposal  explicitly  prohibiting  the  \nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration \nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.   \nVillafaña  circulated  the  defense’s  proposed  plea  agreement  to  Lourie  and  two  other  \nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were \n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.”  Villafaña also pointed \nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines \n                                                 \n118\n  The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to \nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.  \n\n \n74 \n \nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can \nkeep  all  of  his  information  confidential.    I  have  already  told  Jay  that  the  PSI  language  .  .  .  was  \nunacceptable to our office.”   Of even greater significance, in a follow-up email, Villafaña noted \nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and \nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   \nIn  the  afternoon,  Villafaña  circulated  her  own  proposed  “hybrid”  plea  agreement,  first  \ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the 18/12 split that Jay and \nAndy  agreed  to,”  and  then  to  Lefkowitz.    Regarding  the  prosecution  of  other  individuals,  she  \nincluded  the  following  provision:    “This  agreement  resolves  the  federal  criminal  liability  of  the  \ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal \nconduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including \nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution. \nIn her email to Lefkowitz, transmitting the plea agreement, Villafaña wrote:  \nCould  you  share  the  attached  draft  with  your  colleagues.    It  is  in  \nkeeping  with  what  Andy  communicated  to  me  was  the  operative  \n“deal.”  The U.S. Attorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the \nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.  \n  . . . . \n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:00. \n. . .  One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit down \ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna \n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a \nsigned document. \nVillafaña  also  emailed  Acosta  directly,  telling  him  she  planned  to  meet  with  Epstein’s  \nattorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final \napproval.  Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations.  I’d rather leave it to you \nif that’s ok.”  Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was \nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in \nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think \nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.”  Villafaña told OPR, however, that she did not \nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she \nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have \nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\n119\n  Villafaña replied to Acosta’s \n                                                 \n119\n  As noted throughout the Report, Villafaña’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions \noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.  Because it involved subjective interpretations of \nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them \nas  an  indication  of  the  communication  issues  that  hindered  the  prosecution  team.    See Chapter  Two,  Part  Three,  \nSection V.E.  \n\n \n75 \n \nmessage, “That is fine.  [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything down, we just \nwant to get a final blessing.”   \n  Negotiations  continued  throughout  the  day  on  Wednesday,  September  19,  2007,  with  \nVillafaña  and  Lefkowitz  exchanging  emails  regarding  the  factual  proffer  for  a  plea  and  the  \nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms.   During that exchange, Villafaña \nmade clear to Lefkowitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end: \nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by \nMonday.  I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this \nhas  dragged  on  for  several  weeks  already  and  then,  if  things  fall  \napart,  be  left  in  a  less  advantageous  position  than  before  the  \nnegotiations.    I  have  had  an  82-page  pros  memo  and  53-page  \nindictment  sitting  on  the  shelf  since  May  to  engage  in  these  \nnegotiations.    There  has  to  be  an  ending  date,  and  that  date  is  \nMonday. \nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his \nnew  post  at  the  Department  in  Washington,  D.C.—asked  Villafaña  to  furnish  him  with  the  last  \ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “18/12 \nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkowitz the prior afternoon.  After reviewing that draft, Lourie told \nVillafaña  it  was  a  “[g]ood  job”  but  he  questioned  certain  provisions,  including  whether  the  \nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be \nin the plea agreement.  Villafaña told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence” \nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.”   Villafaña explained to OPR that she held \nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was \nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.” \n  At  3:44  p.m.  that  afternoon,  Lefkowitz  emailed  a  “redline”  version  of  the  federal  plea  \nagreement  showing  his  new  revisions,  and  noted  that  he  was  “also  working  on  a  deferred  [sic] \nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.”  The defense \nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor \ncounts  of  attempt  to  intentionally  harass  a  person  to  prevent  testimony,  the  pending  state  \nindictment  charging  solicitation  of  prostitution,  and  a  state  information  charging  one  count  of  \ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.04 (without regard \nto  age).    Neither  of  the  proposed  state  offenses  required  sexual  offender  registration.    Epstein  \nwould serve an 18-month sentence and a concurrent 60 months on probation on the state charges.  \nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and \nreplaced  it  with  the  provision  requiring  creation  of  a  trust  administered  by  the  state  court.      It  \nretained language proposed by Villafaña, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal \ncriminal  liability  of  the  defendant  and  any  co-conspirators  in  the  Southern  District  of  Florida  \ngrowing out of any criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this \nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants \nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration \nproceedings.    It  also  included  a  provision  stating  the  government’s  agreement  to  forgo  a  \npresentence  investigation  and  a  promise  by  the  government  to  suspend  the  investigation  and  \nwithdraw all pending legal process. \n\n \n76 \n \nG. Villafaña  and  Lourie  Recommend  Ending  Negotiations,  but  Acosta  Urges  \nThat They “Try to Work It Out” \n  In  the  late  afternoon  of  Wednesday,  September  19,  2007,  Villafaña  expressed  her  \nincreasing  frustration  to  her  supervisors.    She  emailed  the  defense  redline  version  of  the  plea  \nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions \nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into \nthe agreement.”  (Emphasis in original).  Villafaña opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”  \nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”   \n Lourie immediately emailed Acosta the following: \nI  looked  at  the  latest  draft  from  Jay  [Lefkowitz]  and  I  must  agree  \nwith Marie.  Based on my own conversations with him, his draft is \nout  of  left  field.    He  claims  to  orally  agree  to  our  terms  and  then  \nsends us a document that is the opposite.  I suggest we simply tell \nhim  that  his  counter  offer  is  rejected  and  that  we  intend  to  move  \nforward with our case. \nAcosta replied: \nWhy don’t we just call him.  Tell him \n1. You agree, and then change things. \n2.  That’s  not  acceptable,  and  is  in  bad  faith.    Stop  it  or  we’ll  \n            indict.            \n3. Try to work it out. \nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what \nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics. \nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,  \n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact \nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make \nit less of a right position.  You tell them stop being annoying, you \ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict. \nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.”  He also forwarded to \nAcosta  the  latest  version  of  the  USAO  draft  “hybrid”  plea  agreement  that  Villafaña  had  sent  to  \nLefkowitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafaña earlier that \nafternoon.  \nMeanwhile, Villafaña sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft \nmessage  she  proposed  to  send  to  Lefkowitz  with  her  objections  to  the  defense  revisions,  \nexplaining,  “I  know  that  you  keep  saying  he  is  going  to  plead,  and  he  will  plead  if  we  cave  on  \n\n \n77 \n \neverything,  but  I  really  do  not  think  that  Mr.  Epstein  is  going  to  engage  in  serious  negotiations  \nuntil he sees the Indictment and shows up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.”  She suggested \ncharging  Epstein  on  a  federal  conspiracy  charge,  and  if  he  refused  to  plead  to  that  offense,  \nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial.  She complained that after seven weeks of \nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.”  Her proposed email to Lefkowitz detailed all of \nthe  objectionable  provisions  in  his  draft,  and  concluded,  “If  you  or  your  client  insists  on  these,  \nthere can be no plea agreement.”   \nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaña Sends a Final Version \nto the Defense \n The next day, Thursday, September 20, 2007, Villafaña emailed Assistant State Attorney \nBelohlavek and informed her: \nOur  deadline  is  Monday  evening  for  a  signed  agreement  and  \narraignment in the federal system.  At this time, things don’t look \npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted.  In their latest draft, \nthey  changed  what  they  agreed  to  plead  to  in  the  state  from  \nsolicitation  of  minors  for  prostitution  (a  registrable  offense)  to  \nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense).  We will \nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a \nmutually acceptable agreement.  If that changes, I will let you know. \n Acosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid” \nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems \nvery  straightforward”  and  “we  are  not  changing  our  standard  charging  language”  for  the  \ndefense.\n120\n  Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not \ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should \nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.”\n121\n  Lourie forwarded the email \nto Villafaña with a transmittal message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.  \nPlease  try  to  incorporate  his  suggestions,  change  the  signature  block  to  your  name  and  send  as  \nfinal to Jay.”  Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafaña that he believed the defense would want \nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement.  When Villafaña \nsent  the  revised  plea  agreement  to  Lefkowitz  later  that  afternoon,  she  advised  him  that  if  the  \ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to \nhim on September 17, 2007, would control.   \n                                                 \n120\n    The  USAO  had  standard  federal  plea  agreement  language,  from  which  this  “hybrid”  plea  agreement  had  \nsubstantially diverged.  \n121\n    The  standard  procedure  was  for  documents  such  as  plea  agreements  to  be  signed  by  an  AUSA  under  the  \nname of the U.S. Attorney.  In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an \nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go \nforward with it.”   \n\n \n78 \n \nI. The  Defense  Rejects  the  Federal  Plea  Agreement,  Returns  to  the  NPA  \n“State-Only”   Resolution,   and   Begins   Opposing   the   Sexual   Offender   \nRegistration Requirement \n After having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement, \nby the afternoon of September 20, 2007, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties \nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.  \nThrough multiple emails and attempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other \nsupervisors,  defense  attorneys  vigorously  fought  the  USAO’s  insistence  that  Epstein  plead  to  a  \nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.     \nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkowitz spoke with Villafaña.  She reported \nto  Acosta  and  Lourie  that  Lefkowitz  told  her  the  defense  was  “back  to  doing  the  state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the following week to work out the details, but \nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrow [Friday] or we \nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”   \nLefkowitz  emailed  Villafaña  about  the  draft  NPA  that  she  had  sent  to  him,  pointing  out  \nthat it called for a 20-month jail sentence followed by 10 months of community control, rather than \n18 months in jail and 12 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility” \non the § 2255 procedure.  Villafaña responded: \nThe 18 and 12 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is \nnot a problem.  On the issue about 18 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to \nbe miles apart.  Your most recent version not only had me binding \nthe  girls  to  a  trust  fund  administered  by  the  state  court,  but  also  \npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.  \nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments \non some of your other changes.  In the context of a non-prosecution \nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not \npursuing  charges  against  others.    However,  as  I  stated  on  Sunday,  \nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration. \nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly.  As [State \nAttorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office \ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you \nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day. \nVillafaña alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and \nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not \nconcurrent state and federal.”  She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to \n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”   \nIn  response  to  Villafaña’s  report  of  her  conversation  with  Lefkowitz  about  the  defense  \npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of \n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.”  Lourie emailed Acosta: \n\n \n79 \n \nI  think  Jay  [Lefkowitz]  will  try  to  talk  you  out  of  a  registrable  \noffense.  Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us \ndown  in  time  they  made  us  an  offer  that  included  pleading  to  an  \noffense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and \ntouted that we should be happy because it was registrable.  For that \nreason  alone,  I  don’t  think  we  should  consider  allowing  them  to  \ncome down from their own offer, either on this issue or on time of \nincarceration. \nLefkowitz attempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafaña to return the \ncall, and told Lourie that he did not want to open “a backchannel” with defense counsel.  Lourie \ninstructed Villafaña, “U can tell [J]ay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.” \n On the morning of Friday, September 21, 2007, Villafaña emailed Acosta informing him \nthat “it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,” reporting that the \ncharging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in \nthe  Miami  office  needed  to  review  it.    Villafaña  also  alerted  Lourie  that  she  had  spoken  that  \nmorning to Lefkowitz, who “was waffling” about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required \nsexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek \n“to make sure the defense doesn’t try to do an end run.”   \nThat same morning, Epstein attorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations \nfor several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only \none issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that \nwould assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign \nas soon as today.”  From his out-of-town vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who \nreplied,  “Enjo[y]  vacation.    Working  with  [M]arie  on  this.”    Sloman  also  forwarded  Sanchez’s  \nemail  to  Lourie  and  asked,  “Do  you  know  what  she’s  talking  about?”    Lourie  responded  that  \nSanchez “has not been in any negotiations.  Don’t even engage with yet another cook.”   \nJ. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge “Potential Co-Conspirators”  \n Lefkowitz, in the meantime, sent Villafaña a revised draft NPA that proposed an 18-month \nsentence  in  the  county  jail,  followed  by  12  months  of  community  control,  and  restored  the  \nprovision  for  a  trust  fund  for  disbursement  to  an  agreed-upon  list  of  individuals  “who  seek  \nreimbursement  by  filing  suit  pursuant  to  18  U.S.C.  §  2255.”    This  defense  draft  retained  the  \nprovision  promising  not  to  criminally  charge  Epstein’s  four  female  assistants  and  unnamed  \nemployees of the specific Epstein-owned corporate entity, but also extended the provision to “any \npotential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge arising from the ongoing federal investigation.  \nThis  language  had  evolved  from  similar  language  that  Villafaña  had  included  in  the  USAO’s  \nearlier  proposed  draft  federal  plea  agreement.\n122\n    Lefkowitz  also  again  included  the  sentence  \n                                                 \n122\n    The  language  in  the  USAO’s  draft  federal  plea  agreement  stated,  “This  agreement  resolves  the  federal  \ncriminal  liability  of  the  defendant  and  any  co-conspirators  in  the  Southern  District  of  Florida  growing  out  of  any  \ncriminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] . . . .”    \n\n \n80 \n \nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings \nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals. \nAt  this  point,  Lefkowitz  again  sought  to  speak  to  Acosta,  who  replied  by  email:    “I  am  \nhappy to talk.  My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my \nstaff by allowing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.]  I’ll have \nher set something up.” \n  Villafaña  sent  to  Lefkowitz  her  own  revised  NPA,  telling  him  it  was  her  “attempt  at  \ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.”  She inserted solicitation \nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would \nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 30-month sentence, divided into 18 months \nin  the  county  jail  and  12  months  of  community  control;  and  amended  the  §  2255  provision.\n123\n  \nVillafaña’s  revision  retained  the  provision  suspending  the  investigation  and  holding  all  legal  \nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it \nto  apply  to  “any  potential  co-conspirator  of  Epstein,  including”  the  four  named  assistants,  and  \ndeleting  mention  of  the  corporate  entity  employees.    Finally,  Villafaña  deleted  mention  of  \nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmittal email that “we have not and don’t plan to \nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated.\n124\n   \n Later that day, Villafaña alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C. \nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and \nco-counsel)  that  she  had  included  language  that  defense  counsel  had  requested  “regarding  \npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  There is no \ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement \nwith  Villafaña’s  assessment.    Rather,  within  a  few  minutes,  Villafaña  re-sent  her  email,  adding  \nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which \nLourie responded, “No way.  We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.”  Villafaña replied \nto  Lourie,  indicating  she  would  pass  that  along  to  defense  counsel  and  adding,  “Any  other  \nthoughts?”  When Lourie gave no further response, Villafaña informed defense counsel that Lourie \nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.   \n  OPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential \nco-conspirators.”  Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left \nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some \nway.    In  particular,  Lourie  conjectured  that  the  promise  not  to  prosecute  “any  potential  \nco-conspirators”   protected   victims   who   had   recruited   others   and   thus   potentially   were   \nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme.  Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t \ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in \n                                                 \n123\n  Villafaña noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a \nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an \nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”   \n124\n  Villafaña gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had \nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafaña believed the agent knew two of \nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information.  Villafaña \nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.   \n\n \n81 \n \nfederal court.  Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision \nwas  meant  to  protect  named  co-conspirators  who  were  also  victims,  “in  a  sense,”  of  Epstein’s  \nconduct.    Although  later  press  coverage  of  the  Epstein  case  focused  on  Epstein’s  connection  to  \nprominent  figures  and  suggested  that  the  non-prosecution  provision  protected  these  individuals,  \nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was \ndirected toward any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked \nwith Epstein.\n125\n  Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it.  He speculated \nthat  if  he  read  the  non-prosecution  provision,  he  likely  assumed  that  Villafaña  and  Lourie  had  \n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.”  The West Palm Beach manager, who had \nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he \nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it. \nVillafaña told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had \nnot  developed  evidence  of  “any  other  potential  co-conspirators.    So,  .  .  .  we  wouldn’t  be  \nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? . . .  I just didn’t think that there was anybody \nthat it would cover.”  She conceded, however, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read \nas broadly as people have since read it.”  \nK. The   USAO   Rejects   Defense   Efforts   to   Eliminate   the   Sexual   Offender   \nRegistration Requirement  \nOn  the  afternoon  of  Friday,  September  21,  2007,  State  Attorney  Krischer  informed  \nVillafaña  that  Epstein’s  counsel  had  contacted  him  and  Epstein  was  ready  to  agree  “to  all  the  \nterms”  of  the  NPA—except  for  sexual  offender  registration.    According  to  Krischer,  defense  \ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal \nlaw  enforcement  felt,  at  any  point  during  his  service  of  the  sentence,  that  he  needed  to  do  so.    \nKrischer  noted  that  he  had  “reached  out”  to  Acosta  about  this  proposal  but  had  not  heard  back  \nfrom him.  Villafaña responded, “I think Alex is calling you now.”  Villafaña told OPR that, to her \nknowledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term.\n126\n \n Later that afternoon, Villafaña emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain \ntime”  Epstein  would  earn  in  state  prison.    Villafaña  explained  in  her  email  that  she  wanted  to  \ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain \nnumber  of  days  to  make  sure  he  doesn’t  try  to  ‘convince’  someone  with  the  Florida  prison  \nauthorities  to  let  him  out  early.”    Krischer  responded  that  under  the  proposal  as  it  then  stood,  \nEpstein would serve 15 months.  He also told Villafaña that a plea to a registrable offense would \nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention \nfacility.\n127\n   \n                                                 \n125\n    Sloman  also  pointed  out  that  the  NPA  was  not  a  “global  resolution”  and  other  co-conspirators  could  have  \nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Attorney’s] office in the country.”   \n126\n  Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein \ncase or any other matter.  \n127\n    The  State  Attorney  concluded  his  email:    “Glad  we  could  get  this  worked  out  for  reasons  I  won’t  put  in  \nwriting.    After  this  is  resolved  I  would  love  to  buy  you  a  cup  at  Starbucks  and  have  a  conversation.”    Villafaña  \nresponded, “Sounds great.”  When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafaña said:  “Everybody \n\n \n82 \n \n  At  some  point  that  day,  Acosta  spoke  with  Lefkowitz  by  phone  regarding  the  need  for  \nEpstein  to  plead  to  a  registrable  offense.    Throughout  the  weekend,  with  Villafaña’s  Monday  \ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement.  On \nSaturday, September 22, 2007, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie.  In the first, she provided \ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to \nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation.  She noted that she “spoke to \n[M]att [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her.  Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy \nemail,  strongly  objecting  to  the  registration  requirement,  and  outlining  “all  arguments  against  \nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.”  In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been \na “miscommunication” during the September 12, 2007 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the \nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was \nNOT  registrable.”    Sanchez  complained  that  lifetime  sexual  offender  registration  was  a  “life  \nsentence”  that  was  “uncalled  for,”  “does  not  make  sense,”  and  was  “inappropriate”  to  impose  \n“simply  [because]  the  FBI  wants  it,  in  return  for  all  there  [sic]  efforts.”    She  listed  numerous  \nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of \nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked” \nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state \nregistration requirements.  A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie \n“in case you want to speak to him directly.” \nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again \nbecause “you are a very fair person.  This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable.  [I]t is a \nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.”  She stated that Epstein’s attorneys had “consistently \nemphasized their goal of 18 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable \noffense  precluded”  a  camp  designation.    Sanchez  added,  “Therefore  it  would  have  been  wholly  \ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that \nmeeting.”  Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will \neventually be proud of.  Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.” \nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone \nconversation.  By email late that night, at 10:26 p.m., Lefkowitz asked Lourie to phone him. \n  The next day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña—\nto “follow up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that \nEpstein plead to a registrable offense.  Lefkowitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding” \nat the September 12, 2007 meeting: \nBefore  the  meeting,  Mr.  Krischer  and  Ms.  Belohlavek,  a  sex  \nprosecutor for 13 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not \na registerable offense.  However, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable \noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken \nassumption.  We  suggest  that  Mr.  Epstein  enter  two  pleas—one  to  \nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge. \n                                                 \nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee.  I have had coffee with no one.”  Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which \nhe referred related to the pressure he had been getting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.   \n\n \n83 \n \nLefkowitz  set  forth  arguments  similar  to  those  Sanchez  had  presented  to  Lourie,  as  to  why  \nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.”  In the event \nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkowitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate \nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist \nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors.  As Lefkowitz \nfurther  argued,  “By  accepting  this  option,  you  would  be  substituting  the  certainty  of  recidivist  \nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.”  Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta, \nLourie, and Villafaña discussed the matter in a conference call.   \nLefkowitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafaña that omitted identification of \nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.  Later that day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta: \nI  got  a  call  from  [M]arie  who  said  you  had  rejected  our  proposal.  \nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit \nnow to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his 18 month \nsentence and then be sentenced to 12 month[s] community control \nfor  that  charge?    I  thought  that  was  exactly  what  you  proposed  \n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some \nkind of federal charge).   \nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 30 months total, \nand 18 in jail.   \nHow can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is \nnot unduly endangered in jail? \nAcosta  responded,  “I  do  not  mean  to  be  difficult,  but  our  negotiations  must  take  place  with  the  \nAUSAs assigned to the case.”  Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafaña, and \nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.”  Acosta copied Villafaña, \nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”   \nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause \n   Throughout   that   Sunday   evening,   Lefkowitz   had   numerous   email   exchanges   with   \nVillafaña, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.) \nand Villafaña.  Later that evening, Lefkowitz sent Villafaña a new version of the NPA that, for the \nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:   \nIt  is  the  intention  of  the  parties  to  this  Agreement  that  it  not  be  \ndisseminated  or  disclosed  except  pursuant  to  court  order.    In  the  \nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to \na   request   pursuant   to   the   Freedom   of   Information   Act,   the   \nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure \nof this Agreement.  \nAfter  making  additional  revisions,  Villafaña  sent  this  NPA  to  Acosta  and  Lourie  as  the  \n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her know what he thought of it.  Among her revisions, she \nchanged the confidentiality provision to the following:   \n\n \n84 \n \nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of \nany  public  record.    If  the  United  States  receives  a  Freedom  of  \nInformation  Act  request  or  any  compulsory  process  commanding  \nthe  disclosure  of  the  agreement,  it  will  provide  notice  to  Epstein  \nbefore making that disclosure.\n128\n \nVII. SEPTEMBER  24,  2007:    ACOSTA  MAKES  FINAL  EDITS,  AND  THE  NPA  IS  \nSIGNED \n The contemporaneous emails show that Villafaña continued to update Acosta as the parties \nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA.  Shortly after midnight \non Monday, September 24, 2007, Acosta sent Villafaña “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had \nsent to him.  Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the \nState Attorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein \nenter his guilty plea by a certain date.  Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with \nrequiring  the  State  Attorney  to  enter  into  a  [joint  sentencing]  recommendation”  or  “requiring  a  \nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing.  Accordingly, \nAcosta   substituted   language   that   required   Epstein   alone   to   make   a   binding   sentencing   \nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty \nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates.  Acosta also instructed Villafaña to restore a reference \nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.”  Lourie, \nwho  had  returned  to  the  Department  in  Washington,  D.C.,  had  a  phone  conversation  with  \nLefkowitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafaña.  Villafaña sent \na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkowitz later that morning.   \n On the afternoon of September 24, 2007, Villafaña circulated the new “final” version of \nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkowitz to send her the \nsigned  agreement.    After  Lefkowitz  electronically  transmitted  to  Villafaña  a  copy  of  the  NPA  \nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel:  “They have scanned \nand emailed the signed agreement.  It is done.”   \nIn  his  transmittal  email,  Lefkowitz  asked  Villafaña  to  “[p]lease  do  whatever  you  can  to  \nkeep this from becoming public.”  Villafaña responded: \nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West \nPalm Beach manager].  I don’t anticipate it going any further than \nthat.  When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy \nto you.  The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept \nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the \ngirls. \nWhen we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for \nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the \n                                                 \n128\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged \nco-conspirators  and  other  protected  information,  the  USAO  would  have  a  duty  to  redact  the  information  before  \ndisclosing the NPA.   \n\n \n85 \n \nagreement.  I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when \na resolution was achieved. . . .  [The West Palm Beach manager] is \ncalling,  but  [he]  knows  not  to  tell  Chief  Reiter  about  the  money  \nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and \nthe amount of time that has been agreed to.  [He] also is telling Chief \nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone. \nOPR  questioned  Villafaña  about  this  email.    She  explained  that  she  generally  kept  \nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case.  She understood that “the way that the [Epstein] \ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what \nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to know what the agreement was about.  \nVillafaña emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter \n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet \nwith the victims herself to explain how the damages provision would work.  Villafaña also told \nhim  that  Lourie  had  asked  that  Reiter  share  information  about  the  NPA  only  with  the  PBPD  \nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.\n129\n  Villafaña forwarded to Acosta, Lourie, \nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkowitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA \nfrom becoming public.  Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public \nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does \nhe want?”  Villafaña replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI \nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafaña, \nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and how much,” adding, \n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.” \nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafaña, \ncontained the following pertinent provisions:   \nCharges:  Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment, \nplus  one  count  of  solicitation  of  minors  to  engage  in  prostitution,  a  \nregistrable offense.  \nSentence:  The  parties  would  make  a  joint,  binding  recommendation  for  a  30-month  \nsentence divided as follows:  consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months \nin  the  county  jail,  without  opportunity  for  withholding  adjudication  or  \nsentencing  and  without  community  control  or  probation,  followed  by    \n12 months of community control, consecutive.\n130\n \nDamages:  As  long  as  the  identified  victims  proceeded  exclusively  under  18  U.S.C.  \n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’ \nstatus as victims.  The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals \n                                                 \n129\n  The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.  \n130\n    Withholding  adjudication  or  sentencing  referred  to  a special sentence in which the judge orders probation \nbut does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense.  See Fla. Stat. § 948.01 (2007).  \n\n \n86 \n \nit had identified as victims.\n131\n  The USAO, with the good faith approval of \nEpstein’s counsel, would select an attorney representative for the victims, \nwhom Epstein would pay.  \nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced \nby October 26, 2007.  The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting \nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2008. \nImmunity:  The  USAO  would  not  initiate  criminal  charges  against  “any  potential  \nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants. \nOther:      Epstein  was  obligated  to  undertake  discussions  with  the  State  Attorney’s  \nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.  \n    Epstein waived his right to appeal.  \nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to \ngain  time  or  other  rights,  opportunities,  and  benefits  not  available  to  any  \nother inmate. \nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process \nheld  in  abeyance  unless  and  until  Epstein  violated  any  term  of  the  \nagreement.  Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal \nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate \nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.   \nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the \nagreement   within   90   days   of   the   expiration   of   the   term   of   home   \nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 60 days \nthereafter. \nDisclosure:  The  parties  “anticipate[d]”  that  the  agreement  would  not  be  made  part  of  \nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act \nrequest or compulsory process commanding disclosure of the agreement, it \nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any disclosure.\n132\n \n  That  evening,  Lefkowitz  emailed  Lourie  to  express  concern  about  the  notification  he  \nunderstood  would  be  given  to  Chief  Reiter,  stating,  “I  am  very  concerned  about  leaks  unduly  \nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”\n133\n  He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on \n                                                 \n131\n  The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point.  The parties anticipated that \nthe  USAO  would  send  Epstein’s  attorneys  a  list  of  victims  when  Epstein  fulfilled  his  obligation  under  the  NPA  to  \nenter his state guilty pleas. \n132\n  The final NPA is attached as Exhibit 3 to this Report. \n133\n  On October 3, 2007, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported \nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein.  According to the Post, Epstein would \nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” followed \nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their \n\n \n87 \n \nthis matter.”  Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does \nnot  find  out  about  it  in  the  paper,”  and  he  concluded:    “I  enjoyed  it  as  well.    Mr.  Epstein  was  \nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”  \nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS \nAlmost  immediately  after  the  NPA  was  signed,  conflicts  arose  about  its  terms,  and  the  \ndifficult negotiation process began anew.  The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous \nissues  concerning  the  monetary  damages  provision  that  were  not  resolved  in  the  NPA,  and  the  \nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of \nthe  attorney  representative  for  the  victims.    As  negotiations  regarding  the  damages  provision  \ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.   \nA. September  –  October  2007:    Sloman’s  Concerns  about  Selection  of  an  \nAttorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum \n  The  first  controversy  centered  on  the  appointment  of  an  attorney  representative  for  the  \nvictims.  Initially, Villafaña reached out to a private attorney who was one of several suggested to \nher for that role.  Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that she was recommending the attorney to serve as \nthe  victims’  representative  and  suggested  a  phone  conference  to  discuss  what  information  the  \nUSAO could disclose to the attorney about the case.  Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she had never \nmet the attorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by \none of the district judges in Miami.\n134\n  Over the next few days, Villafaña exchanged messages with \nthe attorney about the possibility of his serving as the attorney representative.  She also exchanged \nemails with Lefkowitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the attorney.   \n  By  this  time,  Lourie  had  fully  transitioned  to  his  detail  at  the  Department’s  Criminal  \nDivision.  Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to \nthe  office,  reviewed  the  final  agreement,  and  immediately  expressed  his  disapproval  of  the  \nprovision  authorizing  the  USAO  to  select  an  attorney  representative  for  the  victims,  which  he  \nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Instead, he proposed that a special \nmaster make the selection.  Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafaña \nconveyed  to  Lefkowitz  the  suggestion  that  a  special  master  be  appointed  to  select  the  attorney  \nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.\n135\n  She provided Lefkowitz with \n                                                 \nprobe  into  possible  federal  criminal  violations  in  exchange  for  the  guilty  plea  to  the  new  state  charge,  with  the  \nunderstanding that he will do prison time.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For \nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007.  ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more \nsubstantial prison time.  Now, Epstein’s high-powered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out \nof registering as a sex offender . . . .”  Scott Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution \nCharges:  Jeffrey Epstein may serve about 18 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. 11, 2007. \n134\n    The  “good  friend”  was  an  AUSA  whom  Villafaña  was  dating.    The  defense  subsequently  raised  this  as  a  \nmisconduct  issue,  alleging  that  Villafaña  was  “closely  associated”  with  the  individual  nominated  for  the  victims’  \nrepresentative position.    \n135\n  In a separate email to the proposed attorney representative, Villafaña commented, “[O]f course they tell me \nthis now.” \n\n \n88 \n \na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft letter to send to the \nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an attorney representative.   \n Lefkowitz objected to this proposal in a letter to Villafaña, pointing out that the NPA did \nnot  provide  for  the  appointment  of  a  special  master.    More  importantly,  Lefkowitz  used  the  \ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the \nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation.  Focusing on the attorney representative, Lefkowitz argued \nthat the attorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating settlements and that the attorney \nwas  precluded  from  filing  lawsuits  on  behalf  of  victims  who  could  not  reach  a  negotiated  \nsettlement with Epstein.  Lefkowitz proposed: \n[T]he selected attorney should evaluate the claims of each identified \nindividual,  negotiate  a  total  fund  amount  with  Mr.  Epstein,  then  \ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case.  For those \nidentified individuals who elect not to settle with Mr. Epstein, they \nmay proceed on their own, but by doing so, they would not be suing \nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not \ncontinue to be represented by the selected attorney. \nLefkowitz  also  objected  to  Villafaña’s  draft  letter  to  the  special  master,  asserting  that  it  was  \nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the \nvictims.  Going further, Lefkowitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims \nabout  the  §  2255  provision  would  violate  the  agreement’s  confidentiality  provision.    Lefkowitz  \nadmonished  the  government  not  to  contact  the  victims  “to  inform  them  of  the  resolution  of  the  \ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected attorney and the settlement process.”   \n   Villafaña   forwarded   Lefkowitz’s   letter   to   Sloman,   complaining   that   the   defense   \ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I \nplease just indict him [Epstein]?”  Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follow-up \nletter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the attorney representative’s role, and \narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’ \ncivil lawsuits in the event a settlement could not be reached.  When Villafaña explained to Sloman \nher  views  on  Sanchez’s  arguments,  Sloman  responded,  “I  suggest  that  you  communicate  your  \nproposal  back  to  [Sanchez].    The  more  ‘voices’  they  hear  the  more  wedges  they  try  to  drive  \nbetween us.”  Villafaña agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we \nare getting triple-teamed.”\n136\n   \n  Villafaña  sent  Sanchez  a  letter  regarding  the  roles  of  the  special  master  and  attorney  \nrepresentative.  The next day, October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a six-page letter to Acosta,  as a \n“follow  up  to  our  conversation  yesterday,”  expressing  “serious  disagreements”  with  Villafaña’s  \nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA.   Lefkowitz reiterated the \ndefense  position  that  the  attorney  representative’s  role  was  meant  to  be  limited  to  negotiating  \nsettlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation.  Lefkowitz claimed that a requirement \n                                                 \n136\n    Villafaña  also  alerted  Sloman  that  a  newspaper  was  reporting  that  defense  counsel  was  writing  a  letter  to  \nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.  Villafaña commented, \n“It appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”      \n\n \n89 \n \nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound \nethical problems,” in that the attorney representative would have an incentive to reject settlement \noffers in order to incur more fees.  In addition, Lefkowitz rejected Villafaña’s view that Epstein \nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to settle their \nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are \nvictims under the enumerated statutes.”  Finally, Lefkowitz again argued that the USAO should \nnot  discuss  the  settlement  process  with  the  victims  who  were  to  be  identified  as  eligible  for  \nsettlement under § 2255: \nMs. Villafaña proposes that either she or federal agents will speak \nwith the [victims] regarding the settlement process.  We do not think \nit  is  the  government’s  place  to  be  co-counsel  to  the  [victims],  nor  \nshould  the  FBI  be  their  personal  investigators.    Neither  federal  \nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to \ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of \nthe  attorney  representative  and  the  settlement  process.    Not  only  \nwould   that   violate   the   confidentiality   of   the   Agreement,   but   \nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to \nthe  [victims]  at  this  most  critical  stage.    We  believe  it  is  essential  \nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication \nto the [victims].  We further believe that communications between \nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate \nRule  6(e)(2)(B)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure.    The  \npowers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be \nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.\n137\n \nLefkowitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:30 call \ntoday.”\n138\n   \nVillafaña was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about \ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an attorney representative \nand to articulate the representative’s duties.  The next day, October 11, 2007, Sloman exchanged \nemails with Lefkowitz about the text of a proposed addendum. \nB. October 12, 2007:  Acosta and Defense Attorney Lefkowitz Meet for Breakfast \n On the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkowitz, Acosta exchanged \nemails with Lefkowitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the following day, on October 12, 2007, at \na Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach.  Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was previously \nscheduled  to  be  in  West  Palm  Beach  for  a  press  event  on  October  11  and  to  speak  at  the  Palm  \nBeach  County  Bench  Bar  conference  the  following  midday,  and  that  he  stayed  overnight  at  the  \nMarriott.   \n                                                 \n137\n  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury matters.  \n138\n  OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.   \n\n \n90 \n \nHowever, as with Villafaña’s publicly released emails to Lefkowitz, this meeting between \nAcosta and Lefkowitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation.  It \nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s attorneys \nwhile  simultaneously  ignoring  the  victims,  or  as  a  meeting  at  which  Acosta  made  secret  \nagreements with the defense.  \nTwo letters written later in 2007 refer to the breakfast meeting.  In a December 2007 letter \nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkowitz at an \nOctober  meeting  in  Palm  Beach  .  .  .  .  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  what  I  foresaw  would  likely  be  a  \nlitigious selection process.”\n139\n  In an October 23, 2007 letter from Lefkowitz to Acosta, less than \ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkowitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta  \nassured  me  that  [the  USAO]  would  not  intervene  with  the  State  \nAttorney’s  Office  regarding  this  matter;  or  contact  any  of  the  \nidentified   individuals,   potential   witnesses,   or   potential   civil   \nclaimants and their respective counsel in this matter; and that neither \n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence \nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the \nsentence does not violate state law.\n140\n \nHowever, two days after receiving this letter, Acosta revised a response letter drafted by \nSloman,  adding  the  term  “inaccurate”  to  describe  Lefkowitz’s  claims  that  Acosta  had  promised  \nnot  to  intervene  with  the  State  Attorney’s  Office,  contact  individual  witnesses  or  claimants,  or  \nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.\n141\n  The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to \nthe imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”\n142\n   \nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that \nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafaña had recommended “her \nboyfriend’s  partner”  to  serve  as  attorney  representative.\n143\n    Acosta  said  that  “the  way  this  was  \nreported  [in  the  press]  was  that  I  negotiated  [the  NPA]  over  breakfast,”  which  was  inaccurate  \nbecause  the  NPA  had  been  signed  weeks  before  the  breakfast  meeting.\n144\n    When  asked  about  \n                                                 \n139\n  In fact, Sloman and Lefkowitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast \nmeeting  with  Lefkowitz.    It  is  possible  that  Acosta  was  not  aware  of  Sloman’s  efforts  or  had  forgotten  about  them  \nwhen writing the December 7, 2007 letter.   \n140\n  This letter is discussed further in the following section of this Report.   \n141\n  OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.   \n142\n  Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified” \nLefkowitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting.   \n143\n    As  noted  previously,  the  attorney  whom  Villafaña  recommended  was  a  friend  of  another  AUSA  whom  \nVillafaña was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafaña or the other AUSA. \n144\n    For  example,  the  Miami  Herald’s  November  2018  investigative  report  stated  that  “on  the  morning  of  the  \nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s \ncrimes  and  the  number  of  people  involved.  .  .  .  [T]he  deal—called  a  non-prosecution  agreement—essentially  shut  \ndown an ongoing FBI probe . . . .”  Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump cabinet member gave \na serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.  The NPA, however, was finalized and signed \n\n \n91 \n \nLefkowitz’s  description  of  their  breakfast  meeting  discussion,  Acosta  told  OPR  that  there  were  \n“several instances” in which Lefkowitz and other defense counsel mischaracterized something he \nor an AUSA said, in a way that was misleading.   \nEmails  show  that,  immediately  after  the  breakfast,  Acosta  phoned  Sloman,  who  then  \nemailed to Lefkowitz a revision to the Addendum language they had been negotiating and who \nalso  later  reported  to  Villafaña  that  Lefkowitz’s  “suggested  revision  has  been  rejected.”    Other  \nemails  show  that  the  parties  continued  to  be  at  odds  about  the  proposed  language  for  the  NPA  \naddendum for several days after the breakfast meeting.   \nC. Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the \nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Attorney Representative \nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum  \n A week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkowitz—citing a scheduling conflict— \nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state \ncourt from October 26, 2007, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 20, 2007.  In his email, \nLefkowitz reported that the State Attorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted \nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the \nstate.”\n145\n  Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkowitz and agreed \nto the postponement.   \n  With  Lourie  having  departed  from  the  USAO,  Sloman  became  more  involved  in  \nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he \nquickly  came  up  against  the  problem  Villafaña  and  Lourie  had  faced:  the  defense  attorneys  \ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed.  Between October \n12  and  19,  2007,  in  a  series  of  email  exchanges  and  phone  conversations,  Acosta,  Sloman,  \nVillafaña, and Lefkowitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the \nprocess  for  selection  of  the  attorney  representative  and  describing  which  of  the  representative’s  \nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse.  Although it appeared that progress was being \nmade towards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October 19, 2007, Lefkowitz \nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.  \nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished \nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues.  Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York \nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafaña was concerned that “this may be the real \nreason for the delay in the . . . plea.  She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out \nbefore  the  guilty  plea  to  deter  others.”      Sloman  also  alerted  Acosta  that  newspaper  reports  \nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an attempt to discredit the victims.   \n                                                 \nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred.  OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis \nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2. \n145\n  Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkowitz attributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta \nhad  taken  before  the  NPA  was  signed.      As  noted  previously,  during  the  NPA  negotiations,  Acosta  had  instructed  \nVillafaña to omit language requiring the State Attorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not \ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline.  During his interview, Acosta told OPR that \n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state attorney.”    \n\n \n92 \n \n On October 22, 2007, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkowitz had raised, rejecting some \ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy \nyour  concern.”\n146\n    Noting  that  the  addendum  and  a  revised  letter  to  the  special  master  were  \nattached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.  Alex and I believe that this is \nas  far  as  we  can  go.    Therefore,  please  advise  me  whether  we  have  a  deal  no  later  than  COB  \ntomorrow . . . .” \nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a three-page letter reiterating the Epstein \nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA.  Lefkowitz noted, however, that \nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense \nletter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].”  Lefkowitz \nadded: \nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during \nour October 12 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with \nregard  to  this  matter,  and  assured  me  that  your  Office  would  not  \nintervene with the State Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or \ncontact  any  of  the  identified  individuals,  potential  witnesses,  or  \npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; \nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding \nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, \nso long as that sentence does not violate state law.  Indeed, so long \nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the \nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him, \nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release. \nSloman  forwarded  the  letter  to  Villafaña,  commenting,  “Wait  [until]  you  see  this  one.”    \nVillafaña replied: \nWelcome  to  my  world.    I  love  the  way  that  they  want  to  interpret  \nthis agreement.  \n. . . .  \nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence \nfar  lower  than  the  one  we  agreed  to.    Has  anyone  talked  to  Barry  \n[Krischer] about this?  Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in \nentering the guilty plea?  We also have to contact the victims to tell \n[them]  about  the  outcome  of  the  case  and  to  advise  them  than  an  \nattorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against \nMr. Epstein.  If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida \nBar Rules for the selected attorney to “cold call” the girls. \n                                                 \n146\n    The  defense  raised  issues  concerning  the  attorney  representative,  the  statutory  limit  on  damages,  and  \ninclusion of certain victims. \n\n \n93 \n \n . . . .  \nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him? \nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafaña and Sloman an email with a subject line \nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated: \nJust read the letter. \n1. We specifically refused to include the provision saying that \nwe would not communicate.  If I recall the conference call, we told \nhim we could not agree to a gag order using those words. \n2.    The  purpose  of  the  agreement  was  not  an  out  of  court  \nsettlement.    Seems  that  they  can’t  take  no.    Let’s  talk  re  how  to  \nproceed.  I’m not sure we will ever agree on a letter [to the special \nmaster about how to select an attorney representative] at this point. \nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkowitz a new \ndraft  addendum  and  they  spoke  by  phone,  the  parties  reached  agreement  on  the  addendum’s  \nterms.\n147\n   \nOn October 25, 2007, Sloman sent a letter to the person whom the USAO had selected to \nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties.  A few days later, on October 29, \n2007, Epstein and his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.\n148\n  Villafaña’s \nname  was  printed  as  the  USAO  representative,  but  at  Villafaña’s  request,  Sloman  signed  the  \naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.   \nVillafaña  later  emailed  Sloman  thanking  him  for  “the  advice  and  the  pep  talk,”  which  \napparently  related  to  the  defense  attorneys’  allegation  of  impropriety  concerning  her  initial  \nselection of the private attorney to assist the victims.  Villafaña explained to Sloman: \nThe  funny  thing  is  that  I  had  never  met  (and  still  haven’t  met)  or  \nspoken to [the private attorney] before I asked him if he would be \nwilling to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the \nappearance  problem,  I  saw  where  the  problem  would  arise  and  \nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route.  I just worry \nthat the defense’s attacks on me could harm the victims. \nSloman  responded  that  defense  counsel  had  “put  an  .  .  .  insidious  spin”  on  Villafaña’s  role  in  \nproposing  the  private  attorney,  but  Sloman  added,  “I  hope  that  you  understand  that  these  ad  \nhominem  attacks  against  you  do  not  diminish  in  our  eyes  what  you  and  the  agents  have  \naccomplished.” \n                                                 \n147\n  Acosta and Villafaña were copied on this email. \n148\n  The Addendum is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Report. \n\n \n94 \n \nD. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea \n The  addendum  did  not  bring  the  case  to  conclusion.    Instead,  the  matter  entered  a  new,  \nprotracted  phase,  which  involved  the  upper  echelons  of  the  Department  of  Justice.    Despite  the  \nfact that Epstein and his attorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing \nto  senior  Department  managers  with  the  goal  of  setting  aside  the  NPA  entirely.    Although  \nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.  \nOn  October  29,  2007,  Villafaña  emailed  Sloman,  raising  several  issues  that  she  wanted  \nSloman  to  address  with  Lefkowitz.    Among  other  things,  Villafaña  pointed  out  that  the  NPA  \nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply \nwith  the  timeline  established  by  the  NPA  when  he  sought  and  obtained  a  plea  hearing  \npostponement from October 26 to November 20.  Responding to Lefkowitz’s attempts to limit the \nUSAO’s  communications  with  various  entities  and  individuals,  Villafaña  noted  that  the  USAO  \nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Attorney’s Office and the victims’ attorney “to \n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”   \nThat same day, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge \nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2008.  Belohlavek \nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that \nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”\n149\n  Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month \nshow that the USAO, the State Attorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate \nregarding  the  date  of  the  guilty  plea,  with  the  USAO  asserting  that  a  proposed  January  7,  2008  \ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that \nEpstein had not agreed to any date.  Finally, after multiple communications referring to various \npotential  dates,  on  December  7,  2007,  Epstein  attorney  Jack  Goldberger  issued  a  Notice  of  \nHearing, setting the case for January 4, 2008.\n150\n \nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to \nMonetary Damages for the Victims  \n With Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of \nthe NPA, this time within the Department.  On November 16, 2007, Epstein attorney Kenneth Starr \ncalled the office of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a \nmessage  that  he  was  calling  regarding  Epstein.\n151\n    At  Fisher’s  request,  Lourie,  who  in  late  \nSeptember  2007  had  begun  serving  his  detail  as  Fisher’s  Principal  Deputy  and  Chief  of  Staff,  \nreturned the call.  Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could \n                                                 \n149\n  The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2007, but provided that Epstein \ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008. \n150\n  State v. Epstein, No. 2006-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2007). \n151\n  In a meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 21, 2007, Lefkowitz informed them that Starr had placed \na call to Fisher.   \n\n \n95 \n \nnot recall for OPR the substance of his conversation with Starr, other than that it was likely about \nEpstein’s wish to have the Department review the case.\n152\n   \n On November 28, 2007, Starr requested, by letter, a meeting with Fisher.  In his letter, Starr \nargued  that  the  USAO  improperly  had  compelled  Epstein  to  agree  to  pay  civil  damages  under  \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case.  On the same day, Lefkowitz \nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision \nand  alerting  Sloman  that  Epstein’s  counsel  were  seeking  a  meeting  with  the  Assistant  Attorney  \nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component” \nof  the  NPA.    After  Lourie  sent  to  Sloman  a  copy  of  the  Starr  letter,  Sloman  forwarded  it  to  \nVillafaña, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and how the § 2255 provision \nevolved.  Villafaña responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried \nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.” \n  In  Washington,  D.C.,  Lourie  consulted  with  CEOS  Chief  Oosterbaan,  asking  for  his  \nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments.  At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafaña sent \nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterbaan.  Oosterbaan responded to Lourie that he was \n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly \nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “pretty advantageous for the defendant \nand not all that helpful to the victims.”  He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General \nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”  \nDuring  her  OPR  interview,  Fisher  did  not  recall  reading  Starr’s  letter  or  discussing  it  with  \nOosterbaan,  but  believed  the  comment  about  her  “agree[ing]  with  it”  referred  to  a  federal  \nprosecution  of  Epstein,  which  she  believed  was  appropriate.    She  told  OPR,  however,  that  she  \n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it \nwas signed. \n As set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafaña planned to notify the \nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she \nprovided  a  draft  of  the  notification  letter  to  Lefkowitz  for  comments.    On  November  29,  2007,  \nLefkowitz sent Acosta a letter complaining about the draft notification to the victims.  Lefkowitz \nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant \nAttorney  General  Fisher,  which  he  anticipated  would  take  place  the  following  week.    Internal  \nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterbaan about his availability for a meeting with Starr, \nbut  both  Fisher  and  Lourie  told  OPR  that  such  a  meeting  never  took  place,  and  OPR  found  no  \nevidence that it did. \nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkowitz by letter, directing him to raise his concerns about \nvictim notification with Villafaña or Sloman.  Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to \nstop the NPA from being enforced: \n                                                 \n152\n  In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply:  “He was very nice.  Kept me on the phone \nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.   \n\n \n96 \n \n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two \nmonths[]  ago,  it  has  become  clear  that  several  attorneys  on  your  \nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result. \n . . . . \n[You],  Professor  Dershowitz,  former  Solicitor  [General]  Starr,  \nformer  United  States  Attorney  Lewis,  Ms.  Sanchez  and  Messrs.  \nBlack,  Goldberger  and  Lefcourt  previously  had  the  opportunity  to  \nreview  and  raise  objections  to  the  terms  of  the  Agreement.    The  \ndefense team, however, after extensive negotiation, chose to adopt \nthe Agreement.  Since then counsel have objected to several steps \ntaken  by  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  to  effectuate  the  terms  of  the  \nAgreement,  in  essence  presenting  collateral  challenges  to  portions  \nof the Agreement. \nIt  is  not  the  intention  of  this  Office  ever  to  require  a  defendant  to  \nenter a plea against his wishes.  Your client has the right to proceed \nto trial.  If your client is dissatisfied with his Agreement, or believes \nthat  it  is  unlawful  or  unfair,  we  stand  ready  to  unwind  the  \nAgreement. \n  In  a  separate,  seven-page  letter  to  Starr,  with  Villafaña’s  and  Sloman’s  input,  Acosta  \nresponded  to  the  substance  of  Starr’s  November  28  letter  to  Assistant  Attorney  General  Fisher.    \nFisher told OPR that she did not recall why Acosta, rather than her office, responded to the letter, \nbut she conjectured that “probably I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the \nCriminal Division wasn’t] going to respond.”\n153\n   \nIn his seven-page letter, sent to Starr on December 4, 2007, Acosta wrote: \nThe  Non-Prosecution  Agreement  entered  into  between  this  Office  \nand Mr. Epstein responds to Mr. Epstein’s desire to reach a global \nresolution  of  his  state  and  federal  criminal  liability.    Under  this  \nAgreement,   this   District   has   agreed   to   defer   prosecution   for   \nenumerated sections of Title 18 in favor of prosecution by the State \nof Florida, provided . . . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal \ninterests:    (1)  that  Mr.  Epstein  plead  guilty  to  a  “registerable”  \noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a \nsufficient  term  of  imprisonment;  and  (3)  that  the  Agreement  not  \nharm the interests of his victims. \nAcosta explained in the letter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims \nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; \nno less.”  Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255 \n                                                 \n153\n  The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s letter raised issues that had not been previously \nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.   \n\n \n97 \n \nprovision,  recounted  the  history  of  NPA  negotiations,  and  described  the  post-signing  efforts  by  \nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA.  Acosta’s letter concluded: \nAlthough  it  happens  rarely,  I  do  not  mind  this  Office’s  decision  \nbeing  appealed  to  Washington,  and  have  previously  directed  our  \nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel \nwith the option of appealing our decisions.  Indeed, although I am \nconfident   in   our   prosecutors’   evidence   and   legal   analysis,   I   \nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject matter experts \nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving \ntheir  [charges].    I  am  thus  surprised  to  read  a  letter  addressed  to  \nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been \nraised  with  this  Office  previously  or  that  have  been  raised,  and  in  \nfact resolved, in your client’s favor. \nI  am  troubled,  likewise,  by  the  apparent  lack  of  finality  in  this  \nAgreement.  The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense \ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics \nused  by  the  defense  team.    It  appears  to  them  that  as  soon  as  \nresolution  is  reached  on  one  issue,  defense  counsel  finds  ways  to  \nchallenge the resolution collaterally.  My response thus far has been \nthat  defense  counsel  is  doing  its  job  to  vigorously  represent  the  \nclient.  That said, there must be closure on this matter.  Some in our \nOffice  are  deeply  concerned  that  defense  counsel  will  continue  to  \nmount  collateral  challenges  to  provisions  of  the  Agreement,  even  \nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the \nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind. \n . . . . \nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force \nthe  hand  of  a  defendant  to  enter  into  an  agreement  against  his  \nwishes.  Your client has the right to proceed to trial.  Although time \nis  of  the  essence  .  .  .  I  am  directing  our  prosecutors  not  to  issue  \nvictim notification letters until this Friday . . . to provide you with \ntime  to  review  these  options  with  your  client.  .  .  .  We  expect  a  \nwritten  decision  by  [December  7,  2007]  at  5  p.m.,  indicating  \nwhether  the  defense  team  wishes  to  reaffirm,  or  to  unwind,  the  \nAgreement. \nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his letter as “inviting” Departmental review, \nbut  he  believed  the  Department  had  the  “right”  to  address  Epstein’s  concerns.    Moreover,  the  \nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have \nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach.  Acosta noted that defense counsel \nrepeatedly  proclaimed  Epstein’s  intent  to  abide  by  the  agreement,  making  any  USAO  effort  to  \ndeclare  him  in  breach  more  difficult.    In  fact,  the  day  after  receiving  Acosta’s  letter,  Starr  and  \nLefkowitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Attorney General Fisher) that \n\n \n98 \n \nthe  defense  “[f]irst  and  foremost”  reaffirmed  the  NPA  and  that  Epstein  “has  no  intention  of  \nunwinding the agreement.”   \nOn December 7, 2007—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2007 letter to Starr—\nthe defense transmitted to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum, \nsigned by Epstein.\n154\n  \nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It \nand Accuse Villafaña of Improper Conduct \n1. December 7 and 11, 2007:  Starr and Lefkowitz Send to Acosta Letters \nand  “Ethics  Opinions”  Complaining  about  the  Federal  Investigation  \nand Villafaña \nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr \nand  Lefkowitz  sent  to  Acosta  two  “independent  ethics  opinions”—one  authored  by  prominent  \ncriminal  defense  attorney  and  former  U.S.  Attorney  Joe  Whitley,  which  assessed  purported  \nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal \njudge  and  former  U.S.  Attorney,  arguing  against  the  NPA’s  use  of  the  civil  damages  recovery  \nprovision under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”   \nDays later, on December 11, 2007, Starr sent a letter to Acosta transmitting two lengthy \nsubmissions  authored  by  Lefkowitz  presenting  substantive  challenges  to  the  NPA  and  to  the  \n“background and conduct of the investigation.”  These submissions repeated arguments previously \nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues.  In one submission, 20 pages long, Lefkowitz \naddressed  the  “improper  involvement”  of  federal  authorities  in  the  investigation  and  criticized  \nVillafaña  for  a  number  of  alleged  improprieties,  including  having  engaged  in  “unprecedented  \nfederal  overreaching”  by  seeking  to  prosecute  Epstein  federally,  “insist[ing]”  that  the  State  \nAttorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are \nsignificantly  harsher  than  what  the  State  deemed  appropriate,”  and  requiring  that  Epstein  plead  \nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”\n155\n \n  Lefkowitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that \nwas  “tainted”  by  the  lead  PBPD  Detective’s  misrepresentation  of  key  facts  in  affidavits  and  \ninterview  summaries,  leading  the  USAO  to  make  its  charging  decision  based  on  flawed  \ninformation  that  “compromised  the  federal  investigation.”    Finally,  Lefkowitz  criticized  federal  \ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.”  In a second, \n13-page submission, Lefkowitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the \nNPA,  arguing,  among  other  things,  that  federal  prosecutors  “should  not  be  in  the  business  of  \nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial settlements.”     \n                                                 \n154\n    The  Affirmation  read:  “I,  Jeffrey  E.  Epstein  do  hereby  re-affirm  the  Non-Prosecution  Agreement  and  \nAddendum to same dated October 30, 2007.” \n155\n  Villafaña sent Lefkowitz a five-page letter responding to the accusations made against her personally.   \n\n \n99 \n \nNotwithstanding    these    voluminous    submissions,    Lefkowitz    added    that    Epstein    \n“unconditionally re-asserts his intention to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the \nNPA. \n2. As  a  Result  of  the  Starr  and  Lefkowitz  Submissions,  the  New  USAO  \nCriminal  Chief  Begins  a  Full  Review  of  the  Evidence,  and  Acosta  \nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel \n After reviewing Starr’s and Lefkowitz’s letters, Sloman notified Villafaña that “in light of \nthe  recent  Kirkland  &  Ellis  correspondence”  he  had  asked  Robert  Senior,  who  had  succeeded  \nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying \nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafaña to provide Senior with all the state \nand FBI investigative materials.   \nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense attorneys to \ndiscuss  the  defense  complaints  raised  in  Lefkowitz’s  December  11,  2007  submissions.\n156\n  The \nmeeting  took  place  in  Miami  on  December  14,  2007.    The  defense  team  included  Starr,  \nDershowitz, Lefcourt, and Boston attorney Martin Weinberg.  The USAO side included Acosta, \nSloman, Villafaña, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and \nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present.  In addition to previously raised arguments, during \nthis meeting, Epstein’s attorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein \nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.   \n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review \nof the USAO’s Actions  \n Shortly after the December 14, 2007 meeting, Lefkowitz notified Acosta that if the issues \nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative \nbut  to  seek  review  in  Washington.”    Acosta  notified  Assistant  Attorney  General  Fisher  that  the  \ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and \n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”  \nStarr  and  Lefkowitz  then  sent  to  Acosta  a  lengthy  letter,  with  numerous  previously  submitted  \ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought \na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.”  The \nletter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under \nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was \n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a \nclaim” under the statute.   \n                                                 \n156\n    As  Assistant  Attorney  General  Fisher’s  Chief  of  Staff,  Lourie  had  informed  Starr  that  Fisher  hoped  Starr  \nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrow issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.  Acosta \nhad the Starr and Lefkowitz submissions of December 11 forwarded to Fisher. \n\n \n100 \n \n4. Acosta  Attempts  to  Revise  the  NPA  §  2255  Language  concerning  \nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It \nAcosta  undertook  to  respond  to  defense  counsel’s  continuing  concern  about  the  §  2255  \nprovision.    He  sent  to  Deputy  Assistant  Attorney  General  Sigal  Mandelker  language  that  he  \nproposed  including  in  a  revision  to  the  NPA’s  §  2255  implementation  section.    Mandelker  \nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and \nAcosta  that  he  did  not  have  “any  insight”  to  offer.    On  December  19,  2007,  after  Acosta  and  \nSloman  had  a  phone  conversation  with  Starr  and  Lefkowitz,  Acosta  sent  to  Sanchez  a  letter  \nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language \nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read: \nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an \noffense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, \nwill  have  the  same  rights  to  proceed  under  Section  2255  as  she  \nwould  have  had,  if  Mr.  Epstein  [had]  been  tried  federally  and  \nconvicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing \nthis  paragraph,  the  United  States  shall  provide  Mr.  Epstein’s  \nattorneys  with  a  list  of  individuals  whom  it  was  prepared  to  \nname . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any \njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority \ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, \nshall  consider  that  it  is  the  intent  of  the  parties  to  place  these  \nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had \nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  \nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the \ndefense delays.\n157\n \nLefkowitz responded by letter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised \n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when \nattempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”\n158\n  In a follow-up \nletter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry \nof his guilty plea, Lefkowitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct \ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made \nand  will  continue  to  make  sincere  efforts  to  resolve  and  finalize  issues  as  expeditiously  as  \npossible.” \n  Acosta  told  OPR  that  despite  this  assurance  from  defense  counsel,  he  was  “increasingly  \nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “11th hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the \n                                                 \n157\n  As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter also addressed defense objections \nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.   \n158\n  After Starr and Lefkowitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkowitz sent a second letter \nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and \nbecoming truly unmanageable.”  In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December 19, 2007 NPA modification \nletter.   \n\n \n101 \n \nscheduled January 4, 2008 plea hearing.  As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve \nan    expedited    review    so    that    Epstein    could    plead    guilty    and    be    sentenced    by        \nJanuary 4, 2008, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled.  On January 2, 2008, Sloman \nspoke with Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing \nhad been postponed.  In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafaña, Sloman said that Epstein’s \nlocal  defense  attorney  Goldberger  had  told  Belohlavek  the  postponement  was  because  the  facts  \n“did  not  fit  the  proposed  state  charge,”  and  that  Belohlavek  told  Sloman  she  agreed  with  that  \nassessment.\n159\n    The  next  day,  Villafaña  sent  to  Acosta  and  Sloman  a  local  newspaper  article  \nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal \nauthorities would drop their investigation of him.  Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafaña an \nemail  memorializing  a  statement  made  to  him  by  Lefkowitz  in  a  phone  call  that  day:    “‘I  \n[Lefkowitz]  may  have  made  a  mistake  6  months  ago.    [Belohlavek]  told  us  solicitation  [is]  not  \nregistrable.  It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”\n160\n \n5. January 7, 2008:  Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes \nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct \n On January 7, 2008, Acosta and Sloman met with defense attorney Sanchez at her request.  \nAccording  to  meeting  notes  made  by  Sloman,  among  other  things,  Sanchez  alleged  that  the  \nUSAO’s  media  spokesperson  had  improperly  disclosed  details  of  the  Epstein  case  to  a  national  \nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC \nby agreeing to a watered-down resolution for Epstein.”  After Acosta excused himself to attend \nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,” \nshe left.  Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkowitz, and Sanchez, \nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA, \nand pressed for the “watered-down resolution,” which they specified would mean allowing Epstein \nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register \nas  a  sexual  offender.    A  note  in  the  margin  of  Sloman’s  handwritten  notes  of  the  conversation  \nreads:  “We’re back to where we started in September.”   \nThat  evening,  Villafaña  expressed  concern  that  the  delay  in  resolving  the  matter  was  \naffecting  the  USAO’s  ability  to  go  forward  with  a  prosecution  should  Epstein  renege  on  his  \nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein \nwas  pursuing  Departmental  review.    Those  steps  included  re-establishing  contact  with  victims,  \ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact \nwith  “potential  sources  of  information”  in  the  Virgin  Islands,  and  re-initiating  proceedings  to  \nobtain Epstein’s computers. \n In the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts” \nreview  of  the  Epstein  investigation,  reviewing  the  indictment  package  and  all  of  the  evidence  \nVillafaña had compiled.  He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined \n                                                 \n159\n  Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth \nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.   \n160\n  Although the meeting Lefkowitz had with Lourie, Villafaña, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state \nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkowitz’s reference was likely to the September 12, 2007 meeting.   \n\n \n102 \n \nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go \nforward with” the charges.  He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we \ndid not have . . . a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not \nbe favorable for us.”  Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he \ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.   \n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence \n Notwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkowitz \nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that \nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the \ndefense.”  They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that \nCEOS Chief Oosterbaan would designate an attorney having “a national perspective” to conduct \na fresh review in light of the defense submissions.  Oosterbaan assigned a CEOS Trial Attorney \nwho Villafaña understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not \n“consummate”  the  NPA.    The  CEOS  Trial  Attorney  traveled  to  Florida  to  review  the  case  \nmaterials, and to meet with Villafaña to discuss the case and interview some of the victims.  After \none such meeting, Villafaña wrote to Acosta and Sloman: \nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls.  I wish you could \nhave been there to see how much this has affected them. \nOne girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview \ntwice within a 20 minute span.  She regained her composure enough \nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares \nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break down again, \nso we stopped the interview. \nThe  second  girl  .  .  .  told  us  that  she  was  very  upset  about  the  18  \nmonth deal she had read about in the paper.  She said that 18 months \nwas  nothing  and  that  she  had  heard  that  the  girls  could  get  \nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein \nspend a significant time in jail. \n . . . . \nThese girls deserve so much better than they have received so far, \nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.\n161\n \nThe CEOS Trial Attorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.  \nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges \nfor a prosecution:  some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein; \nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged \nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been \n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.  She did not regard \n                                                 \n161\n  Villafaña added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrow.  Can I persuade you to attend?”  \n\n \n103 \n \nthese  victim  issues  as  insurmountable  but,  based  on  these  alone,  the  CEOS  Trial  Attorney  \nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.”  In addition, she told OPR that \nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these \ndifficulties  could  be  overcome.    Shortly  after  the  CEOS  Trial  Attorney  met  with  the  victims,  \nhowever,  “things  just  stopped”  when  Oosterbaan  instructed  her  to  cease  her  involvement  in  the  \ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.   \nIX. FEBRUARY – JUNE 2008:  THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW \nEpstein’s defense attorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would \nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the \nvarious  allegations  of  professional  misconduct  by  USAO  attorneys  and  other  personnel.    The  \nDepartment, however, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA \nor  any  specific  provisions.\n162\n    Nonetheless,  the  process  took  several  months  as  the  defense  \nappealed  first  to  CEOS  and  the  Department’s  Criminal  Division,  and  then  to  the  Office  of  the  \nDeputy  Attorney  General.    The  chart  set  forth  on  the  following  page  shows  the  positions  and  \nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO \nor  defense  beginning  in  November  2007  or  in  those  offices’  reviews,  which  continued  through  \nJune 2008. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n162\n    On  February  28,  2008,  USAO  Criminal  Division  Chief  Senior  sent  to  the  Civil  Rights  Division  written  \nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation matter” involving Epstein and others “that \nmay result in charges of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.”  USAM § 8-3.120 required a U.S. Attorney to notify the \nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal \ncivil rights statutes, . . . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses \nbefore a grand jury.”  The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.  \nThe written notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the \nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Attorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the \ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Attorney’s proposed staffing of the matter.   \nVillafaña became aware of this requirement in late February 2008, and she prepared a written notification \nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta.  After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:  \nThe  Office  anticipates  charges  of  violations  of  Title  18,  United  States  Code,  \nSections 371, 2422, 2423, and 1591.  The investigation of the case by the City of \nPalm  Beach  Police  Department  has  resulted  in  press  coverage  because  of  the  \ntitillating  nature  of  the  facts,  but  we  see  this  case  as  similar  to  other  “child  \nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a matter of “national interest” \nas defined by the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. \nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the matter,” he \nanticipated the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should \nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.”  OPR did not locate a response from the \nCivil Rights Division to the notification. \n\nCriminal Division \n*until late Feb. 2008 \nAlice Fisher \nAssistant Attorney \nGeneral \nAndrew Lourie* \nPrincipal Deputy \nAssistant Attorney \nGeneral \nSigal Mandelker \nDeputy Assistant \nAttorney General \nAndrew \nOosterbaan \nChief, CEOS \nOffice of the Deputy \nAttorney General \nMark Filip \nDeputy \nAttorney \nGeneral \nJohn Roth \nSenior Associate \nDeputy Attorney \nGeneral \nA. February -May 15, 2008: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division \nOn Febrnaiy 21, 2008, soon after the CEOS Trial Attorney met with victims, Oosterbaan \nspoke with Lefkowitz about CEO\nS's role. fu a subsequent email to Villafana , Sloman, and Senior, \nOosterbaan explained: \nI  told  [Lefkowitz]  that all I  want  to  do is  help  the process move \nfo1ward, and if they think we best help the process by taking a fresh \nand objective look at the case and their arguments [then] t  h\nat is what \nI want to d\no. I told him that if that's what they want -if that is what \nwill help the process to move \nfo1ward -   then I  don' t  think it 's \nadvisable for CEOS to partner with the USAO on the case.  He wants \nto think about that (and probably  talk to his  co-counsel about \n104 \n\n \n105 \n \nwhether it is better to have us partnered in the case or just serve a \nreview function) and he said he’d get back to me later today. \nOosterbaan told OPR that this email reflects that he likely told Acosta that he intended to \nlimit CEOS’s role to review only, and Acosta asked him to “make sure the defense is okay with \nthat,”  to  preempt  a  possible  defense  complaint  about  CEOS’s  involvement  in  the  review.    \nOosterbaan  explained  to  OPR  that  “the  defense  ke[pt]  bringing  up  new  arguments  and  new  \nproblems and [the USAO was saying] look if we’re going to do this, if you’ve got a problem with \nit, tell us now.”   \nBy February 25, 2008, Lefkowitz told Oosterbaan, who informed Sloman, that the CEOS \nrole should be “review only.”  Lourie had just then left the Department to enter private practice, \nand  Oosterbaan  continued  to  keep  his  direct  supervisor,  Deputy  Assistant  Attorney  General  \nMandelker,  informed  of  the  defense  team  contacts.    Sloman  emailed  Lefkowitz  that  CEOS  was  \n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the matter.  Sloman advised Lefkowitz that “in \nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein, \nthis  Office  will  close  its  investigation,”  but  that,  “should  CEOS  disagree  with  Mr.  Epstein’s  \nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].”  Sloman forwarded this email \nto Villafaña, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has \nput us through?  And after we have discovered 6 new girls . . . .” \n The defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the \nDepartment’s involvement.  On February 29, 2008, Lefkowitz requested a defense meeting with \nOosterbaan on March 12, 2008.\n163\n  Starr spoke to Assistant Attorney General Fisher and “made it \nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the \nprosecution.”  On March 6, 2008, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterbaan that Starr and Lefkowitz \nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterbaan’s participation in the case, and indicated \nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.”  Acosta “informed them that they certainly had \nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever \nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”  \nThe next day, Lefkowitz followed up with Acosta in an email: \nWe appreciate that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice \ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this matter.  \nAs  you  have  suggested,  we  will  initiate  that  review  process  with  \nDrew Oosterbaan, and engage in a discussion with him about all of \nthe  facts  and  circumstances,  as  well  as  the  legal  and  policy  issues  \nassociated  with  this  case.  .  .  .    However,  due  to  our  misgivings  \n(engendered  because  Drew  has  told  us  that  he  sees  himself  as  a  \nprosecutor and has already made clear he would be ready and willing \nto  prosecute  this  case  himself[)]  we  may  well  find  it  necessary  to  \n                                                 \n163\n  The defense team meeting with CEOS was originally to be set for late January, but never got scheduled for \nthat time.  On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkowitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays” \nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS \ntime to engage in a thorough review.”   \n\n \n106 \n \nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.  Ken [Starr] \nand I appreciate that you understand this and have no objection to \nour seeking appellate review within DOJ. \n Starr, Lefkowitz, and Martin Weinberg attended the March 12, 2008 meeting, as well as \nthe  former  Principal  Deputy  Chief  of  CEOS,  who  had  joined  the  Epstein  defense  team.    \nOosterbaan,  Mandelker,  and  a  current  CEOS  Deputy  Chief  represented  the  Department.    The  \ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing \nmost of the presentation.  Oosterbaan told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the \ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.”  Both Oosterbaan and his Deputy Chief were \ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for \nchild  exploitation  prosecutions,  was  supporting  the  defense  position,  although  according  to  the  \nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not \neffective. \nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkowitz made multiple written submissions to the Criminal \nDivision.  One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious \nconcern,” including the following: \n“Federal  involvement  in  a  state  criminal  prosecution  without  any  \ncommunication with state authorities”;\n164\n  \nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that \n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”; \nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the \nAssistant United States Attorneys involved in this case” to serve as \nthe victims’ attorney representative; \nthe “insistence” on a victim notification letter inviting the victims to \nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and \nthe  purported  existence  of  a  “relationship”  between  Sloman  and  a  \nlaw  firm  representing  several  of  the  alleged  victims  in  civil  suits  \nagainst Epstein.\n165\n \n                                                 \n164\n    This  complaint  appeared  to  be  at  odds  with  Villafaña’s  understanding  that  the  defense  objected  to  USAO  \ncommunications  with  the  state  authorities.    In  November  2007,  Sloman  noted  to  Lefkowitz,  “Your  recent  \ncorrespondence  attempting  to  restrict  our  Office  from  communicating  with  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  .  .  .  raises  \nconcern.”    In  a  March  2008  email  reporting  to  CEOS  about  the  state  case,  Villafaña  noted  that  she  did  not  know  \nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact \nwith the State Attorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Attorney] in over 6 months.”  Villafaña \nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating \nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”   \n165\n  In approximately 2001, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a \nMiami  attorney,  whose  practice  specialized  in  plaintiffs’  sexual  abuse  claims.    During  2007-2008,  the  attorney  \n\n \n107 \n \nIn another letter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed \ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafaña of “encouraging civil \nlitigation”  against  Epstein.    Finally,  in  a  letter  to  Assistant  Attorney  General  Fisher  on    \nMay  14,  2008,  Starr  thanked  her  for  having  spoken  with  him  the  previous  day,  reiterated  the  \ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitley.    \nMeanwhile, Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision letter to be sent from Oosterbaan \nto Lefkowitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, as well as \nthe  Criminal  Division’s  Appellate  Section  (regarding  certain  legal  issues)  and  Office  of  \nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).  Oosterbaan told OPR that, notwithstanding \nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited \nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.    \nOosterbaan’s  letter,  sent  to  Lefkowitz  on  May  15,  2008,  notified  the  defense  team  that  \nCEOS  had  completed  its  independent  evaluation  of  whether  prosecution  of  Epstein  for  federal  \ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.”  The letter specified \nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrow question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a \nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues \nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA \nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations.  The letter stated that based on its examination of the \nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the matter, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution \nin  this  case  would  not  be  improper  or  inappropriate”  and  that  Acosta  “could  properly  use  his  \ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”    \n On May 19, 2008, Lefkowitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically \nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”  Lefkowitz made several points in support \nof the request for a meeting:  (1) CEOS’s letter acknowledged that federal prosecution of Epstein \nwould  involve  a  “novel  application”  of  relevant  federal  statutes;\n166\n  (2)  CEOS’s  conclusion  that  \nfederal  prosecution  would  not  be  “an  abuse  of  discretion”  was  “hardly  an  endorsement”  of  the  \ncase;\n167\n (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical \nnew  evidence,”  in  the  form  of  recent  defense  counsel  depositions  of  victims  confirmed  “that  \n                                                 \nrepresented Epstein victims.  The Epstein defense team alleged in the letter that Sloman’s past association with the \nattorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.  \n166\n  Oosterbaan’s letter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution \neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.”  This statement referred to a defense argument \nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult \nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.”  Oosterbaan stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly \nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults \nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.”  He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look \nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”    \n167\n  Oosterbaan began his letter, however, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrow question as \nto  whether  there  is  a  legitimate  basis  for  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  to  proceed  with  a  federal  prosecution  of  \nMr. Epstein.”  \n\n \n108 \n \nfederal  prosecution  is  not  appropriate  in  this  case.”\n168\n    Lefkowitz  alluded  to  the  possibility  of  \nseeking further review of the matter by the Deputy Attorney General or Attorney General, should \nthe defense be unable to “resolve this matter directly with” Acosta.   \n Acosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkowitz to communicate \nwith  the  “trial  team.”    That  same  day,  Sloman  sent  Lefkowitz  a  letter  asking  that  all  further  \ncommunication about the case be made to Villafaña or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating \nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls.  Sloman noted that the USAO \nhad  “bent  over  backwards  to  exhaustively  consider  and  re-consider”  Epstein’s  objections,  but  \n“these objections have finally been exhausted.”  Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate \nthe   NPA   unless   Epstein   complied   with   all   of   its   terms   by   the   close   of   business   on      \nJune 2, 2008.   \nB. May – June 23, 2008:  Review by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General \nAlso on May 19, 2008, Starr and Whitley co-authored a letter to Deputy Attorney General \nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state matter.”\n169\n  In \nthe letter, they acknowledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the \nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of \nthe Justice Department.”  They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and \nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond \nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.”  They followed up \nwith a second letter on May 27, 2008, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the \nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented \nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton” \nrequired Departmental review.  On this latter point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public \narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that \nthere was “little doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case \nif  Mr.  Epstein  were  just  another  ‘John.’”    This  was  the  first  defense  submission  mentioning  \nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement \nin the investigation was due to politics. \n  In  the  May  27,  2008  letter  to  the  Deputy  Attorney  General,  Starr  and  Whitley  used  the  \nexisting June 2, 2008 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need \nfor  review  of  the  case  “all  the  more  exigent.”    John  Roth,  a  Senior  Associate  Deputy  Attorney  \nGeneral  who  was  handling  the  matter,  instructed  the  USAO  to  rescind  the  deadline,  and  on    \nMay  28,  2008,  Sloman  notified  Lefkowitz  that  the  USAO  had  postponed  the  deadline  pending  \ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Attorney General’s office.\n170\n  Meanwhile, the Criminal \n                                                 \n168\n  Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220, defendants are permitted to depose victims, and Epstein’s \ncounsel  utilized  that  procedure  aggressively  and  expansively  to  conduct  sworn  interviews  of  multiple  victims,  \nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation. \n169\n    In  addition  to  having  served  as  U.S.  Attorney  in  two  different  districts,  Whitley  had  served  as  Acting  \nAssociate Attorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.  \n170\n  On May 28, 2008, Attorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO \nwith Acosta and other senior managers.  OPR found no indication that the Epstein matter was discussed.   \n\n \n109 \n \nDivision  forwarded  to  Roth  the  prior  defense  submissions,  describing  them  as  “an  enormous  \namount of material” regarding the Epstein matter.  On June 3, 2008, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy \nletter from Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations \nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional \nmisconduct.  Among the documents submitted with the letter were the prosecution memorandum, \none  of  the  proposed  charging  documents,  and  the  NPA  with  its  addendum  and  Acosta’s  \nDecember 19, 2007 letter to Sanchez. \nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, State Attorney \nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local \ndefense attorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve \na 90-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.  Upon learning of this, Villafaña \nwrote to her immediate supervisor:  “Please tell me that you are joking.  Maybe we should throw \nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.”  Villafaña and her immediate \nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to \ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the \nagreement and proceed accordingly.”\n171\n  \n Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving \nStarr’s letter.  Following the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s letter was handled by John Roth, \nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the \nUSAO.  Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein.  Roth explained to OPR \nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s \ncounsel, and instead limited his review to written materials submitted by Epstein’s attorneys and \nby Sloman to the Deputy Attorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and \nthe  USAO  had  previously  provided  to  CEOS  and  the  Criminal  Division  front  office,  and  that  \nCEOS furnished to him.  Roth discussed the matter with two senior staff colleagues, as well as \nwith the Deputy Attorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.   \nRoth  told  OPR  that  it  was  his  understanding  that  Epstein  had  reneged  on  the  NPA,  and  \nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead letter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or \nratify it post hoc.  On the other hand, Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR he understood that \nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis \nfor  the  agreement.    Apart  from  addressing  Epstein’s  federalism  arguments,  however,  Deputy  \nAttorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether \nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment.  He told OPR, “[W]e \nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief.  We didn’t give him a meeting \nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.”  Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his \noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.”  In particular, he \ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was \n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated \n“just seemed unserious.”   \n                                                 \n171\n  Villafaña urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.” \n\n \n110 \n \nOn Monday, June 23, 2008, Roth sent a brief letter to Starr and Lefkowitz informing them \nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein matter \nand  did  not  believe  intervention  by  the  Deputy  Attorney  General  was  warranted  in  view  of  the  \n“considerable  discretion”  vested  by  the  Department  in  U.S.  Attorneys.    He  added,  “Even  if  we  \nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution \nof this case is appropriate.”   \nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s letter, Villafaña notified defense counsel that \nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the NPA \nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence.  On \nJune 26, 2008, Roth alerted the Office of the Attorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to \ncontact the Attorney General to request additional review and urged the Attorney General not to \ntake defense counsel’s calls.  Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try \nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.   \n Meanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknowledging they had reached “the \nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe \nis the government’s treatment of my client, a man whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize \nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. . . .  I would like to have . . . some \nclosure with you on this matter so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will \nover the matter.” \nX. JUNE  2008  –  JUNE  2009:    EPSTEIN  ENTERS  HIS  PLEAS  AND  SERVES  HIS  \nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE \n  On  Friday,  June  27,  2008,  Villafaña  renewed  her  requests  to  Epstein’s  local  attorneys  \nGoldberger  and  Black  for  a  copy  of  the  state  plea  agreement  reached  with  the  State  Attorney’s  \nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA.  After receiving \nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafaña sent another letter to \nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with \nthe requirements of the NPA.  Specifically, as written, the plea agreement called for a sentence of \n12 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” followed consecutively by “18 months \nCommunity  Control”  with  a  special  condition  that  the  defendant  serve  “the  first  6  months  [of  \ncommunity  control]  in  the  Palm  Beach  County  Detention  Facility.”    Villafaña  objected  to  the  \ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to \n“make  a  binding  recommendation  of  eighteen  months  imprisonment,  which  means  confinement  \ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.”  In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafaña recounted \nthat  she  had  spoken  about  the  issue  with  Goldberger,  who  “‘swore’  that  Epstein  would  be  in  \ncustody  24-hours-a-day  during  the  community  confinement  portion  of  his  sentence.”    Villafaña  \nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade \n. . . . Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Attorney] months ago that \nEpstein  would  be  at  [the  jail],  this  certainly  violates  the  spirit  of  the  [NPA]  agreement.”\n172\n  \nVillafaña told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”   \n                                                 \n172\n  The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum \ncustody    adult    males,    as    well    as    juvenile    and    special    population    male    and    female    inmates.        See \n\n \n111 \n \nThe next day, Villafaña asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the \nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.  Villafaña, however, did not \nask  that  the  agreement  be  amended  to  clarify  that  the  reference  to  “the  Palm  Beach  County  \nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade.  The final signed plea agreement form \nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving 12 months in the Palm Beach County \nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention \nFacility  .  .  .  to  be  served  consecutive  to  the  12  month  sentence,”  followed  by  “12  months  \nCommunity Control.”  The word “imprisoned” was hand written after “6 months” but then crossed \nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”\n173\n   \nA. June 30, 2008:  Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court \n  Epstein,  with  his  attorney  Jack  Goldberger,  appeared  in  Palm  Beach  County  court  on    \nJune 30, 2008, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of \nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of \nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.\n174\n  At the plea hearing, which Villafaña and the \nFBI case agent attended as spectators, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts \nof  the  case;  instead  she  only  recited  the  charging  language  in  the  indictment  and  the  criminal  \ninformation: \n[B]etween August 1, 2004 and October 31, 2005, the defendant in \nPalm  Beach  County  did  solicit  or  procure  someone  to  commit  \n[prostitution]  on  three  or  more  occasions.    And  .  .  .  between    \nAugust  1,  2004  and  October  9,  2005,  the  defendant  did  procure  a  \nminor  under  the  age  of  18  to  commit  prostitution  in  Palm  Beach  \nCounty also.\n175\n \nThe court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in \na colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims: \nThe Court:        Are there more than one victim? \nMs. Belohlavek:   There’s several. \n . . . . \n                                                 \nhttp://www.pbso.org/inside-pbso/corrections/general/.  The “Stockade” was a “lower security ‘camp-style’ facility” \nco-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  Both were administered by the Sheriff’s Office. \n173\n  Plea in the Circuit Court, signed June 30, 2008, and filed in court.  Villafaña complained to Goldberger when \nshe learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”  \n174\n  The Information is attached as Exhibit 5. \n175\n  State v. Epstein, case nos. 06-CF-9454 and 08-CF-9381, Transcript of Plea Conference at 41-42 (Fifteenth \nJudicial Circuit, June 30, 2008) (Plea Hearing Transcript).  Belohlavek told OPR that reciting the statutory language \nof the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.   \n\n \n112 \n \nThe  Court:      Are  all  the  victims  in  both  these  cases  in  \nagreement with the terms of the plea? \nMs. Belohlavek:   I  have  spoken to  several  myself  and  I  have  \nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the \nother victim, and I believe, yes. \nThe  Court:      And  with  regard  to  the  victims  under  age  \neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian \nin agreement with the plea? \nMs. Belohlavek:   That victim is not under age 18 any more and \nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel. \nThe Court:        And she is in agreement with the plea? \nMs. Belohlavek:   Yes.\n176\n \nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations \nby any civil attorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present, \nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution \nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.   \nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to \nthe plea agreement,\n \nEpstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.   \nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed \npositive  reactions  to  the  outcome,  and  Villafaña  received  several  congratulatory  messages.    \nOosterbaan  wrote,  “Congratulations,  Marie—at  long  last!    Your  work  on  this  matter  was  truly  \nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.”  One senior \ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad \nguy  going  to  jail  because  of  your  dedication  and  determination.”    Another  wrote,  “If  it  had  not  \nbeen for you, he would have gotten away with it.”   The CEOS Trial Attorney who had worked \nbriefly with Villafaña told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s \nlife.”  One victim’s attorney stated, “[G]reat job of not letting this guy off.”  But Villafaña was not \nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I \ndon’t feel like celebrating 18 months.  He should be spending 18 years in jail.”   \nAcosta  later  publicly  stated  that  the  FBI  Special  Agent  in  Charge  called  him  “to  offer  \ncongratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, \n                                                 \n176\n  Plea Hearing Transcript at 20, 42.  OPR was unable to determine to which victims Belohlavek was referring, \nand Belohlovek did not recall during her OPR interview, but it is possible that she was referring only to the victims of \nthe charged crimes rather than to all of the victims identified in either the state or federal investigations.  Belohlavek \ntold  OPR  that  because  of  the  nature  of  the  charges  (that  is,  involving  prostitution),  she  did  not  know  whether  \n“technically under the law” the girls were “victims” whom she was required to notify of the plea hearing.   \n\n \n113 \n \nDershowitz,  Lefkowitz  and  Starr.”\n177\n    In  that  same  later  public  statement,  Acosta  noted  that  he  \nreceived communications from Dershowitz, Starr, and Lefkowitz, who “all sought to make peace” \nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”   \nOn July 7, 2008, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in \nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined \nthe petition soon thereafter.  The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in \nChapter Three of this Report.   \nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release \n  A  few  days  after  Epstein’s  guilty  plea,  Villafaña  reported  to  Sloman  that  Epstein  was  \nincarcerated  at  the  low-security  Stockade,  rather  than  the  Main  Detention  Center  where  county  \nprisoners were usually housed.  She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein \nwas eligible for work release.  Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be \nincarcerated  24  hours  a  day,  every  day,  the  subject  of  work  release  had  not  been  addressed  \nexplicitly  during  the  NPA  negotiations,  and  the  NPA  itself  was  silent  on  the  issue.    Epstein’s  \nacceptance  into  the  work  release  program  as  a  convicted  sexual  offender  was  seen  by  many  as  \nanother  special  benefit  given  to  Epstein.    Because  the  decision  to  allow  Epstein  into  the  work  \nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether \nany  state,  county,  or  Sheriff’s  Office  rules  were  violated.    OPR  did  examine  the  USAO’s  \nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to \nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.     \nThe  first  specific  reference  to  work  release  was  made  weeks  after  the  NPA  was  signed,  \nwhen Lefkowitz asserted, in his October 23, 2007 letter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s \nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence \navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”   \nIn November 2007, Sloman had an exchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s \nunderstanding  that  Epstein  had  agreed  to  serve  his  full  jail  term  in  “continuous  confinement,”  \npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.”  Sloman noted \nthat  Florida’s  Department  of  Corrections’s  rules  did  not  allow  individuals  registered  as  sexual  \noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release \nprogram.  Sloman concluded that the USAO “is putting you on notice that it intends to make certain \nthat  Mr.  Epstein  is  ‘treated  no  better  and  no  worse  than  anyone  else’  convicted  of  the  same  \noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the \nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”\n178\n   \n However, also in November, State Attorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact, \neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place \n                                                 \n177\n  Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The Daily \nBeast.  The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknowledged that \nit could have occurred.   \n178\n  Sloman provided a draft of this letter to Acosta for his approval before the letter was sent to Lefkowitz.   \n\n \n114 \n \nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is \nin the agreement.”\n179\n  On November 16, 2007, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if \nthe  State  Attorney’s  Office  would  oppose  a  request  that  Epstein  be  granted  work  release.    \nBelohlavek was noncommittal, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s \nplea  agreement  prohibiting  Epstein  from  participating  in  work  release,  she  responded  that  she  \nwould  have  to  discuss  the  issue  with  the  State  Attorney.\n180\n    Krischer  later  told  OPR  that  work  \nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.”  The state’s plea agreement \nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.   \nThe  day  after  Epstein  entered  his  June  30,  2008  plea,  Villafaña  and  her  immediate  \nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release.  According to \nVillafaña, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on \nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a \njail  supervisor  the  previous  November,  as  well  as  statements  made  by  defense  attorney  Jack  \nGoldberger  to  Villafaña  just  days  before  the  plea  was  entered,  when  he  “specifically  told  \n[Villafaña]  that  [Epstein]  would  not  get  work  release.”    Villafaña  alerted  the  Sheriff’s  Office  \nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every \nday”  for  a  “couple  of  years”  at  the  “Florida  Science  Foundation,”  that  entity  did  not  even  exist  \nuntil  November  2007.\n181\n    Moreover,  the  address  Epstein  provided  to  the  court  for  the  “Florida  \nScience  Foundation”  was  the  office  of  Epstein’s  attorney  Jack  Goldberger.    Villafaña  and  her  \nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.   \n Acosta told OPR that he was aware Villafaña was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get \nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts.  Acosta explained that the USAO \nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shown by “our subsequent \ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not \nwhat our office envisioned.”   \n  In  August  2008,  Villafaña  spoke  with  defense  attorney  Black  about  ensuring  Epstein’s  \ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release.  Villafaña later reported to Acosta \nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . 18 months IN JAIL is a \nmaterial term of the agreement.” \n The USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application.  On October 10, \n2008,  less  than  three-and-a-half  months  after  Epstein  entered  his  guilty  plea,  the  Palm  Beach  \nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permitting him to leave the Stockade \n                                                 \n179\n  According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex \noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”  \n180\n    In  the  November  16,  2007  email,  on  which  she  copied  Acosta,  Villafaña  also  indicated  that  she  was  \n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work \nrelease.    In  a  subsequent  email,  the  FBI  case  agents  informed  Villafaña  that  they  had  also  spoken  with  a  “jail  \nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the \njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.   \n181\n  During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had \nbeen in existence for 15 years, and he worked there “every day.”   Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.  \n\n \n115 \n \nfor up to 12 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office \nin  West  Palm  Beach.\n182\n    In  mid-November  2008,  Villafaña  learned  that  Epstein  was  on  work  \nrelease.  She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development \nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him now?”   \nOn November 24, 2008, Villafaña sent defense attorney Black a letter, notifying him that \nthe  USAO  believed  Epstein’s  application  to  and  participation  in  the  work  release  program  \nconstituted a material breach of the NPA.  Villafaña reminded Black that she had “more than a \ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for 18 months, \nand that her June 27, 2008 letter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.”  Villafaña noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into \nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.”  Villafaña \ntold counsel: \nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based \nupon  its  determination  that  eighteen  months’  incarceration  (i.e.,  \nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the \nfederal  interest  in  Mr.  Epstein’s  crimes.    Accordingly,  the  U.S.  \nAttorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated \nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day \nfor  the  eighteen-month  term  of  imprisonment.    The  United  States  \nwill  exercise  any  and  all  rights  it  has  under  the  [NPA]  unless  \nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this \nagreement. \nAccording  to  Villafaña,  the  FBI  case  agent  spoke  with  the  Stockade’s  work  release  \ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to \nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened \nwith legal action if he did not allow Epstein to participate in work release.    \n On November 26, 2008, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from \nall  matters  involving  the  law  firm  of  Kirkland  &  Ellis,  which  was  still  heavily  involved  in  the  \nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.\n183\n  As a \nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to \nEpstein.   \nAlso  on  November  26,  2008,  Black  responded  to  Villafaña’s  letter,  acknowledging  that  \nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying \nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.\n184\n  Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release; \nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate; \n                                                 \n182\n  Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm \nBeach Daily News, Dec. 13, 2008.   \n183\n  The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2008.   \n184\n  Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafaña “is very concerned about anything Epstein does” \nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.   \n\n \n116 \n \nFlorida  law  treated  work  release  as  part  of  confinement;  and  the  Palm  Beach  County  Sheriff’s  \nOffice  had  discretion  to  grant  work  release  to  any  inmate.    Black  also  claimed  that  Acosta  \n“recognized  that  Mr.  Epstein  might  serve  a  portion  of  his  sentence  through  the  Work  Release  \nProgram”  and  pointed  out  that  the  December  6,  2007  draft  victim  notification  letter  sent  to  \nLefkowitz  for  review  specifically  referred  to  the  victim’s  right  to  be  notified  “if  [Epstein]  is  \nallowed to participate in a work release program.”   \n  On  December  3,  2008,  in  advance  of  a  scheduled  meeting  with  Black,  Villafaña  sent  \nSloman  and  Criminal  Division  Chief  Senior  an  email  about  Epstein’s  participation  in  the  work  \nrelease program: \nIt appears that, since Day 1, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have \nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release.  For example, the \nindictment  incorrectly  charges  Epstein  for  an  offense  that  would  \nhave  made  him  ineligible  for  work  release  if  it  had  been  charged  \ncorrectly.  (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with letting \nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when \nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was \nnot  registrable.)    Krisher  [sic]  and  Goldberger  also  told  us  that  \nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the \nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at \nthe jail. . . .   \nAs  part  of  his  work  release,  Epstein  has  hired  off-duty  Sheriff’s  \ndeputies  to  provide  him  with  “protection.”    It  appears  that  he  is  \npaying between $3000 and $4100 per week for this service, despite \nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and \nthe  Sheriff’s  Office  itself)  from  having  “any  business  transactions  \nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the \nSheriff . . . .” \nVillafaña added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge \non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement.  Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafaña also \npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed \nabout  the  investigation,”  and  the  office  had  “an  obligation  to  inform  all  of  the  victims  upon  \nEpstein’s release.”   \n  On  December  11,  2008,  Villafaña  wrote  to  the  Corrections  Division  of  the  Palm  Beach  \nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release \nand  to  alert  the  Sheriff’s  Office  that  Epstein’s  work  release  application  contained  several  \ninaccuracies  and  omitted  relevant  information.    Villafaña  pointed  out  that  Epstein’s  application  \nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number \nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law \nfirm of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger.  Villafaña also noted that the individual identified in \nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submitted \npublicly  available  sworn  filings  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  indicating  that  Epstein  worked  \nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to \n\n \n117 \n \nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for 12 hours per \nday.      Finally,   Villafaña   pointed   out   that   Epstein’s   purported   “supervisor”—who   as   the   \nFoundation’s  vice  president  was  subordinate  to  Epstein,  the  Foundation’s  president—had  \npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the \n“supervisor”  lived  and  worked  in  the  New  York  metropolitan  area  and  was  unable  to  monitor  \nEpstein’s  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis.    The  Sheriff’s  Office  neither  acknowledged  nor  \nresponded to Villafaña’s letter. \nIn March 2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz characterized it \nin  a  subsequent  email,  “a  relaxed  drink  and  conversation,”  which  included  a  discussion  of  the  \nEpstein  case.    After  that  encounter,  Dershowitz  emailed  Sloman,  expressing  appreciation  for  \nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach sheriff administers” \nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.”  Sloman responded: \nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney’s Office will not \ninterfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the \nsentence imposed by the Court.  That being said, this does not mean \nthat  the  USAO  condones  or  encourages  the  PBSO  to  mitigate  the  \nterms and conditions of his sentence.  Furthermore, it does not mean \nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or \nin-home detention, we would not object.  To be clear, if contacted \nwe  will  object.    Naturally,  I  also  expect  that  no  one  on  behalf  of  \nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent \nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or \nhome detention. \nA  week  later,  Dershowitz  emailed  Sloman  again,  this  time  expressing  appreciation  for  \nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position \non how he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but \nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”    \n  Epstein’s  sentence  required  that  he  be  confined  to  his  home  for  a  12-month  period  \nfollowing his release from prison.  On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began serving his \nsentence,  Epstein  was  released  from  the  Stockade  and  placed  on  home  confinement.\n185\n  At this \ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.  \nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS \n  In  the  summer  of  2009,  allegations  surfaced  that  Epstein  had  cooperated  with  the  U.S.  \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear \nStearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that \n                                                 \n185\n    In  Florida,  what  is  commonly  referred  to  as  house  arrest  is  actually  the  Community  Control  supervision  \nprogram.    Florida  Statute  §  948.001(3)  defines  the  program  as  “a  form  of  intensive,  supervised  custody  in  the  \ncommunity.” \n\n \n118 \n \ncooperation.\n186\n    When  Villafaña  spoke  with  attorneys  in  the  Eastern  District  of  New  York,  \nhowever, an AUSA there told Villafaña that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not \ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.\n187\n  During her OPR interview, Villafaña told OPR that to \nher knowledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”   \n Villafaña and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the \nNPA.  In August 2009, Villafaña alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of \nhis home detention—he had been spotted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police, \nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.  Villafaña \npassed  this  information  along  to  the  Palm  Beach  County  probation  office.\n188\n    By  letter  dated  \nSeptember 1, 2009, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision \nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein \nmaintained his “primary residence.”  In response, Villafaña notified Black that the USAO opposed \nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA.  Three months later, Sloman met with \nDershowitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of \nEpstein’s  community  control  supervision  and  would  object  to  a  request  to  transfer  Epstein’s  \nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.   \n  After  serving  his  year  on  home  detention  in  Florida,  Epstein  completed  his  sentence  on  \nJuly 21, 2010. \n  \n  \n                                                 \n186\n  See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2009. \n187\n  The New York AUSA had emailed Villafaña, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] . . . .  We \nsaw the below article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never \nheard of until this morning.  We’ve since learned that he is pretty unsavory.”  Villafaña reported to Sloman and other \nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of] \nNew  York.    They  had  seen  the  NY  Post  article  that  claimed  that  Epstein  got  such  a  low  sentence  because  he  was  \ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution.  They had never heard of him.”  In a second email, she \nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”   \n188\n  Black later wrote a letter to Villafaña claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the \ndistance  between  his  home  and  office  was  “less  than  three  miles,”  and  when  the  matter  was  “fully  investigated,”  \nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.   \n\n \n119 \n \nCHAPTER TWO \nPART TWO:  APPLICABLE STANDARDS \n \nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK  \n  OPR  finds  professional  misconduct  when  an  attorney  intentionally  violates  or  acts  in  \nreckless  disregard  of  a  known,  unambiguous  obligation  imposed  by  law,  rule  of  professional  \nconduct, or Department regulation or policy.  In determining whether an attorney has engaged in \nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual \nfindings. \n An attorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the attorney (1) engages \nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously \nprohibits;  or  (2)  engages  in  conduct  knowing  its  natural  or  probable  consequence,  and  that  \nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits.  An attorney acts \nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (1) the attorney knows or should know, \nbased  on  his  or  her  experience  and  the  unambiguous  nature  of  the  obligation  or  standard,  of  an  \nobligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows or should know, based on his or her experience and \nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the attorney’s conduct involves a \nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard; \nand (3) the attorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under \nall the circumstances.  Thus, an attorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents \na  gross  deviation  from  the  standard  of  conduct  that  an  objectively  reasonable  attorney  would  \nobserve in the same situation.  \n  If  OPR  determines  that  an  attorney  did  not  engage  in  professional  misconduct,  OPR  \ndetermines whether the attorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct, \nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances.  An attorney exercises poor \njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that \nis  in  marked  contrast  to  the  action  that  the  Department  may  reasonably  expect  an  attorney  \nexercising good judgment to take.  Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an \nattorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not \nhave  violated  or  acted  in  reckless  disregard  of  a  clear  obligation  or  standard.    In  addition,  an  \nattorney  may  exhibit  poor  judgment  even  though  an  obligation  or  standard  at  issue  is  not  \nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding.  A mistake, on \nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an attorney’s exercise of reasonable \ncare under the circumstances.  \nAn  attorney  who  makes  a  good  faith  attempt  to  ascertain  the  obligations  and  standards  \nimposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional \nmisconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith attempt to ascertain and comply with \nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the attorney \nreviewed  materials  that  define  or  discuss  one  or  more  potentially  applicable  obligations  and  \nstandards,  consulted  with  a  supervisor  or  ethics  advisor,  notified  the  tribunal  or  the  attorney  \nrepresenting  a  party  or  person  with  adverse  interests  of  an  intended  course  of  conduct,  or  took  \n\n \n120 \n \naffirmative steps the attorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or \nstandard. \nII. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT \nA. The United States Attorneys’ Manual  \n  Among  its  many  provisions,  the  United  States  Attorneys’  Manual  (USAM)  includes  \ngeneral  statements  of  principles  that  summarize  appropriate  considerations  to  be  weighed,  and  \ndesirable  practices  to  be  followed,  by  federal  prosecutors  when  discharging  their  prosecutorial  \nresponsibilities.\n189\n  The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial \nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and \nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and \nobjectively on the merits of each case.”  USAM § 9-27.001.  \nBecause  the  USAM  is  designed  to  assist  in  structuring  the  decision-making  process  of  \ngovernment attorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing \nguidance rather than mandating results.  Id.; see also USAM § 9-27.120, comment (“It is expected \nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law \nenforcement responsibilities . . . . However, it is not intended that reference to these principles will \nrequire  a  particular  prosecutorial  decision  in  any  given  case.”);  USAM  §  9-27.110,  comment  \n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when, \nwhom,  how,  and  even  whether  to  prosecute  for  apparent  violations  of  Federal  criminal  law.”).    \nHowever,  USAM  §  9-27.130  provides  that  AUSAs  who  depart  from  the  principles  of  federal  \nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline.  In particular, USAM \n§ 9-27.130 states that each U.S. Attorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that \nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with \nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles \nset forth in the USAM are followed by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary \nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate. \nU.S. Attorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal matters” and may \nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of \nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, \n9.27-140.    The  USAM  provisions  are  supplemented  by  the  Department’s  Criminal  Resource  \nManual,   which   provides   additional   guidance   relating   to   the   conduct   of   federal   criminal   \nprosecutions. \n1. USAM  Provisions  Relating  to  the  Initiation  and  Declination  of  a  \nFederal Prosecution  \n Federal prosecutors do not open a case on every matter referred to them.  USAM § 9-2.020 \nexplicitly  authorizes  a  U.S.  Attorney  “to  decline  prosecution  in  any  case  referred  directly  to  \n                                                 \n189\n  In 2018, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.  In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR \nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.  Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, \ncitations in this Report are to the 1997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2007. \n\n \n121 \n \nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.”  Whenever a U.S. Attorney closes a \ncase  without  prosecution,  the  file  should  reflect  the  action  taken  and  the  reason  for  it.    USAM  \n§ 9-27.220 sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence \nor decline federal prosecution.  A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution \nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a \nconviction of a federal offense, unless (1) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the \nperson  is  subject  to  effective  prosecution  in  another  jurisdiction;  or  (3)  there  exists  an  adequate  \nalternative to prosecution.  A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to \ndetermine  whether  these  circumstances  exist,  and  in  making  that  determination,  the  prosecutor  \n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.230, 9-27.240, or 9-27.250, as appropriate. \n  USAM  §  9-27.230  sets  forth  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  considerations  that  a  federal  \nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by \ninitiating prosecution against a person: \n1. Federal law enforcement priorities;\n190\n \n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense;\n191\n \n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution; \n4. The person’s culpability in connection with the offense; \n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity; \n6.  The  person’s  willingness  to  cooperate  in  the  investigation  \n or prosecution of others; and \n7.  The  probable  sentence  or  other  consequences  if  the  person  \n            is            convicted.            \n The USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case \nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred.  USAM § 9-27.240 directs \nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor \nshould  weigh  “all  relevant  considerations,”  including  the  strength  of  the  other  jurisdiction’s  \ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and \nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other \njurisdiction.  A comment to this provision explains: \n                                                 \n190\n    A  comment  to  this  provision  directs  the  prosecutor  to  consider  carefully  the  extent  to  which  a  federal  \nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities. \n191\n  A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must \nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim.  The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue, \n“care  should  be  taken  .  .  .  to  ensure  against  contributing  to  an  impression  that  an  offender  can  escape  prosecution  \nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.” \n\n \n122 \n \nSome  offenses,  even  though  in  violation  of  Federal  law,  are  of  \nparticularly  strong  interest  to  the  authorities  of  the  state  or  local  \njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the \noffense,  the  identity  of  the  offender  or  victim,  the  fact  that  the  \ninvestigation    was    conducted    primarily    by    state    or    local    \ninvestigators,  or  some  other  circumstance.    Whatever  the  reason,  \nwhen  it  appears  that  the  Federal  interest  in  prosecution  is  less  \nsubstantial   than   the   interest   of   state   or   local   authorities,   \nconsideration   should   be   given   to   referring   the   case   to   those   \nauthorities  rather  than  commencing  or  recommending  a  Federal  \nprosecution. \nAnother  comment  cautions  that  in  assessing  whether  to  defer  to  state  or  local  authorities,  “the  \nFederal  prosecutor  should  be  alert  to  any  local  conditions,  attitudes,  relationships  or  other  \ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a \nthorough and successful prosecution.” \n USAM § 9-27.260 identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether \nto  initiate  or  decline  a  federal  prosecution.    Specifically,  the  decision  may  not  be  based  on  \nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities, \nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “own personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible \neffect  of  the  decision  on  the  prosecutor’s  own  professional  or  personal  circumstances.    When  \nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision \nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files.  USAM § 9-27.270. \n2. USAM § 9-2.031:  The Petite Policy \n Although the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and \nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the \nDepartment has a long-standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions \ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar \nconduct.\n192\n    The  general  principles  applicable  to  the  prosecution  or  declination  decision  are  set  \nforth  in  USAM  §  9-2.031,  “Dual  and  Successive  Prosecution  Policy  (‘Petite  Policy’),”  which  \ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring \na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or \nfederal  proceeding.    The  policy  applies  “whenever  there  has  been  a  prior  state  or  federal  \nprosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, \nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”   \nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new \nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.  The prerequisites are as follows: \n(1)  The matter must involve a substantial federal interest.  The determination whether \na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis.  Matters \n                                                 \n192\n  See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (1977); Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529 (1960).  \n\n \n123 \n \nthat  come  within  the  national  investigation  and  prosecution  priorities  established  \nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other matters. \n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably \nunvindicated.”  In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has \nvindicated  federal  interests,  but  that  presumption  may  be  overcome  in  certain  \ncircumstances.    As  relevant  here,  the  presumption  may  be  overcome  when  the  \nchoice   of   charges   in   the   prior   prosecution   was   based   on   factors   such   as   \nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence.  The presumption may \nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior \nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a \nsubstantially  enhanced  sentence—including  forfeiture  and  restitution  as  well  as  \nimprisonment    and    fines—is    available    through    the    contemplated    federal    \nprosecution.” \n  (3)  The  government  must  believe  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  constitutes  a  federal\n offense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\n sustain a conviction. \nHowever,  the  satisfaction  of  the  prerequisites  does  not  require  a  prosecutor  to  proceed  with  a  \nfederal  investigation  or  charges  nor  is  the  Department  required  to  approve  the  proposed  \nprosecution. \n The Petite policy cautions that whenever a matter involves overlapping federal and state \njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most \nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests \ninvolved.”  If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular \nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the matter to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General \nfor resolution.  Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General must be obtained \nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy. \n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements \n Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a \nplea agreement.  USAM §§ 9-27.330; 9-27.400.  Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned \nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).\n193\n  Regardless of whether the plea agreement is \noffered  pre-charge  or  post-charge,  the  prosecutor’s  plea  bargaining  “must  honestly  reflect  the  \ntotality  and  seriousness  of  the  defendant’s  conduct.”    USAM  §  9-27.400,  comment.\n194\n  The \nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM \n§  9-27.430,  which  directs  the  prosecutor  to  require  a  defendant  to  plead  to  an  offense  that  \nrepresents  the  most  serious  readily  provable  charge  consistent  with  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  \n                                                 \n193\n    As  previously  noted,  Rule  11(c)(1)(C)  permits  the  parties  to  agree  to  resolve  the  case  in  exchange  for  a  \nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.   \n194\n  See also USAM § 9-27.300 (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the attorney for the government \nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is \nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).  \n\n \n124 \n \ndefendant’s  criminal  conduct,  has  an  adequate  factual  basis,  makes  likely  the  imposition  of  an  \nappropriate  sentence  and  order  of  restitution,  and  does  not  adversely  affect  the  investigation  or  \nprosecution of others.  USAM § 9-27.420 specifies:  \nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea \nagreement,  the  attorney  for  the  government  should  weigh  all  \nrelevant considerations, including: \n  1.  The  defendant’s  willingness  to  cooperate  in  the  \ninvestigation or prosecution of others; \n2.  The  defendant’s  history  with  respect  to  criminal  \nactivity; \n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses \ncharged; \n  4.  The  defendant’s  remorse  or  contrition  and  his/her  \nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct; \n5. The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of \nthe case; \n6. The likelihood of obtaining a conviction at trial; \n7. The probable effect on witnesses; \n8.  The  probable  sentence  or  other  consequences  if  the  \ndefendant is convicted; \n  9.  The  public  interest  in  having  the  case  tried  rather  \nthan disposed of by a guilty plea; \n10. The expense of trial and appeal; \n11.  The  need  to  avoid  delay  in  the  disposition  of  other  \npending cases; and \n 12. The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution. \n4. USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements \n  USAM  §  9-27.600  authorizes  government  attorneys  to  enter  into  a  non-prosecution  \nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation.  The provision explains that a non-prosecution \nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely \ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired \ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.”  A comment to this provision explains that \nsuch  “other  means”  include  seeking  cooperation  after  trial  and  conviction,  bargaining  for  \n\n \n125 \n \ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.  \nThe  comment  observes  that  these  alternative  means  “are  clearly  preferable  to  permitting  an  \noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in \nthe first instance.”  USAM §§ 9-27.620 and 9-27.630 set forth considerations a prosecutor should \ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement.  Generally, the U.S. Attorney \nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement.  USAM § 9-27.600 comment.  However, \nUSAM  §  9-27.640  directs  that  a  government  attorney  should  not  enter  into  a  non-prosecution  \nagreement  in  exchange  for  a  person’s  cooperation  without  first  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  \nappropriate Assistant Attorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who \n“is likely to become of major public interest.”   \n  These  USAM  provisions  do  not  address  the  uses  of  non-prosecution  agreements  in  \ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation. \n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity \n Nothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure \nof  third  parties  in  negotiating  with  a  criminal  defendant.    Instead,  the  provision  that  addresses  \nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has \nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  See USAM §§ 9-23.100 et seq.   \n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest \n Department employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related \nlaws,  rules,  regulations,  and  policies.    See,  generally,  USAM  §  1-4.000  et  seq.    Specifically,  a  \ngovernment   attorney   is   prohibited   by   criminal   statute   from   participating   personally   and   \nsubstantially  in  any  particular  matter  in  which  he  has  a  financial  interest  or  in  which  such  an  \ninterest can be imputed to him.  See 18 U.S.C. § 208 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.401-402.  In addition, \na  Department  employee  should  seek  advice  from  an  ethics  official  before  participating  in  any  \nmatter in which his impartiality could be questioned.  If a conflict of interest exists, in order for \nthe  employee  to  participate  in  the  matter,  the  head  of  the  employee’s  component,  with  the  \nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in \nthe  employee’s  participation  outweighs  the  concern  that  a  reasonable  person  may  question  the  \nintegrity  of  the  Department’s  programs  and  operations.  The  determination  must  be  made  in  \nwriting.  See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.501-502. \nB. Other Department Policies \n1. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges \n The Attorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the \nDepartment.  Over the span of several decades, each successive Attorney General has articulated \nthose  priorities  in  policy  memoranda  issued  to  all  federal  prosecutors.    As  applicable  here,  on  \nSeptember   22,   2003,   Attorney   General   John   Ashcroft   issued   a   memorandum   regarding   \n“Department  Policy  Concerning  Charging  Criminal  Offenses,  Disposition  of  Charges,  and  \nSentencing”  (Ashcroft  Memo).    The  Ashcroft  Memo,  which  explicitly  superseded  all  previous  \nDepartmental  guidance  on  the  subject,  set  forth  policies  “designed  to  ensure  that  all  federal  \n\n \n126 \n \nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the \nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing \npractices.”\n195\n \n  The  Ashcroft  Memo  directed  that,  “in  all  federal  cases,  federal  prosecutors  must  charge  \nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of \nthe  case,”  except  as  authorized  by  an  Assistant  Attorney  General,  U.S.  Attorney,  or  designated  \nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances.  The Ashcroft Memo cautioned \nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either \nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.  The Ashcroft \nMemo  explains  that  the  “basic  policy”  “requires  federal  prosecutors  to  charge  and  pursue  all  \ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence \nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.   \nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor \nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the written \nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or “designated \nsupervisory  attorney.”    As  examples  of  circumstances  in  which  such  declination  would  be  \nappropriate,  the  Ashcroft  Memo  cites  to  situations  in  which  a  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  is  \n“particularly  over-burdened,”  the  trial  is  expected  to  be  of  exceptionally  long  duration,  and  \nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.  \nThe  Ashcroft  Memo  specifically  notes  that  “[c]harges  may  be  declined  .  .  .  pursuant  to  a  plea  \nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo. \n  On  January  28,  2005,  Deputy  Attorney  General  James  Comey  issued  a  memorandum  \nentitled  “Department  Policies  and  Procedures  Concerning  Sentencing.”    That  memorandum  \nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily \nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial \nsentence”  under  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,  any  applicable  mandatory  minimum,  and  any  \nstatutorily required consecutive sentence. \n  Importantly,  although  the  Ashcroft  and  Comey  memoranda  limit  an  individual  line  \nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is \nplaced upon the U.S. Attorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.  In \naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allowing a prosecutor \n                                                 \n195\n  The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 \n(2005), which struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose \na  sentence  within  the  applicable  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines  range.    Those  Guidelines  were  the  product  of  \nthe  United  States  Sentencing  Commission,  which  was  created  by  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act  of  1984.    The  \nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003, Pub. \nL.  108–21,  117  Stat.  650,  was  directed  at  preventing  child  abuse.    It  included  a  variety  of  provisions  designed  to  \nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.  Among other things, the PROTECT Act \nprovided  for  specific  sentencing  considerations  for  certain  sex-related  offenses,  such  as  those  involving  multiple  \noccasions  of  prohibited  sexual  conduct  or  those  involving  material  with  depictions  of  violence  or  with  specified  \nnumbers of images. \n\n \n127 \n \nflexibility  to  decline  to  bring  a  particular  charge  based  on  a  “good  faith  doubt”  that  the  law  or  \nevidence supports the charge. \n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens \n On April 28, 1995, the Attorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors \nentitled  “Deportation  of  Criminal  Aliens,”  directing  federal  prosecutors  to  actively  and  directly  \nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States.  In pertinent \npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious \ndeportation  of  criminal  aliens  by  effectively  using  available  prosecution  tools  for  dealing  with  \nalien  defendants.    These  tools  include  (1)  stipulated  administrative  deportation  orders  in  \nconnection  with  plea  agreements;  (2)  deportation  as  a  condition  of  supervised  release  under  \n18  U.S.C.  §  3853(d);  and  (3)  judicial  deportation  orders  pursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  §  1252a(d).    The  \nmemorandum further directs: \nAll    deportable    criminal    aliens    should    be    deported    unless    \nextraordinary   circumstances   exist.      Accordingly,   absent   such   \ncircumstances,  Federal  prosecutors  should  seek  the  deportation  of  \ndeportable  alien  defendants  in  whatever  manner  is  deemed  most  \nappropriate in a particular case.  Exceptions to this policy must have \nthe written approval of the United States Attorney.  \nSee also USAM § 9-73.520.  A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a \ncrime.\n196\n \n            Stipulated            administrative            deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense \nto  which  the  alien  will  plead  guilty,”  provided  that  the  offense  is  one  of  those  enumerated  in  \n8   U.S.C.   §   1251   as   an   offense   that   causes   an   alien   to   be   deported.      Under   8   U.S.C.   \n§ 1251(a)(2)(A)(i), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years \nafter  the  date  of  entry  (or  10  years  in  the  case  of  an  alien  provided  lawful  permanent  resident  \nstatus),  and  is  either  sentenced  to  confinement  or  confined  to  prison  for  one  year  or  longer,  is  \ndeportable.   \nC. Case Law \n1. Prosecutorial Discretion \n  On  many  occasions,  the  Supreme  Court  has  discussed  the  breadth  of  the  prosecutor’s  \ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute.  In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 \n(1978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek \nmore  serious  charges  against  the  accused  if  the  accused  did  not  plead  guilty  to  the  offense  \noriginally charged.  The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and \n                                                 \n196\n  According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have \nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border \nPatrol.”  See U.S.  Dept.  of  Homeland  Security,  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  CBP  Enforcement  Statistics,  \nCriminal  Alien  Statistics  Fiscal  Year  2020,  available  at  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics. \n\n \n128 \n \nthe  prosecutor  indicted  him  on  more  serious  charges.    Hayes  was  thereafter  convicted  and  \nsentenced under the new indictment.  The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his \nconviction,  concluding  that  the  prosecutor’s  decision  to  indict  on  more  serious  charges  was  a  \nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process.  Hayes filed for review of his \nconviction  and  sentence  in  federal  court,  and  although  Hayes  lost  at  the  district  court  level,  the  \nU.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit  concluded  that  the  prosecutor’s  conduct  constituted  \nimpermissible vindictive prosecution. \n The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling.  The Court opined that “acceptance \nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty \nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining \nprocess.”    Id.  at  363.    A  long  as  the  prosecutor  has  probable  cause  to  believe  a  crime  has  been  \ncommitted, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a \ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.”  Id. at 364 (emphasis added).  The Court explained that \nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable \nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.  Id. \n  These  principles  were  reiterated  in  Wayte  v.  United  States,  470  U.S.  598  (1985),  a  case  \ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves \nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system.  The petitioner in Wayte claimed \nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were \nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.  The Supreme Court rejected this \nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and \nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an \nunjustifiable standard.  Id. at 607-08.  Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to \nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.   \n            In            Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state \nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation \nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others \nhad  unlawfully  conspired  to  charge  and  convict  him.    The  Court  held  that  “in  initiating  a  \nprosecution  and  in  presenting  the  State’s  case,”  conduct  that  is  “intimately  associated  with  the  \njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit \nfor damages.  Id. at 430-31.  In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st Cir. 1992), the court applied \nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute.  The court noted that “given the \navailability  of  immunity  for  the  decision  to  charge,  it  becomes  even  more  important  that  \nsymmetrical  protection  be  available  for  the  decision  not  to  charge.”    Id.  at  41  (emphasis  in  \noriginal).   \n Finally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), the \nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not \nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706.  \n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency towards a Third Party \n Case law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party \narises in two contexts.  First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea \n\n \n129 \n \nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations.  Numerous courts have \nmade clear, however, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a \npromise of leniency towards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third \nparty if a plea is not entered.  See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 909 F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir. \n1990) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by \nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he \npled  guilty);  Martin  v.  Kemp,  760  F.2d  1244,  1248  (11th  Cir.  1985)  (in  order  to  satisfy  “heavy  \nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging \nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against \nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe \nthe  defendant’s  wife  had  committed  a  crime  at  the  time  it  threatened  to  charge  her);  Stinson  v.  \nState, 839 So. 2d 906, 909 (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a \nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge \nthe third party.”). \n  The  second  context  concerns  situations  in  which  courts  have  enforced  prosecutors’  \npromises of leniency to third parties.  For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App. \n1997),  as  consideration  for  the  defendant’s  guilty  plea,  the  prosecutor  agreed  and  announced  in  \nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew, \nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident.  When the state reneged and attempted \nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state \nappealed.    The  appellate  court  affirmed  the  dismissal,  concluding  that  under  contract  law  \nprinciples,  the  niece  and  nephew  were  third-party  beneficiaries  of  the  plea  agreement  and  were  \ntherefore entitled to enforce it.   \n  Apart  from  voluntariness  or  enforceability  concerns,  courts  have  not  suggested  that  a  \nprosecutor’s  promise  not  to  prosecute  a  third  party  amounts  to  an  inappropriate  exercise  of  \nprosecutorial discretion.    \nD. State Bar Rules \n During the period relevant to this Report, the five subject attorneys were members of the \nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in \nwhich they held membership.\n197\n  In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of \nthe  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Florida  (Local  Rules)  and  the  choice-of-law  \nprovisions of each applicable bar.  Local Rule 11.1(f) incorporates rules governing the admission, \npractice,  peer  review,  and  discipline  of  attorneys  (Attorney  Admission  Rules).\n198\n    Attorney  \nAdmission  Rule  4(d)  provides  that  any  U.S.  Attorney  or  AUSA  employed  full-time  by  the  \ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United \nStates in the attorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.  Any attorney so appearing \n                                                 \n197\n  The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.   \n198\n  These rules have been in effect since December 1994. \n\n \n130 \n \nis  subject  to  all  rules  of  the  court.\n199\n    Attorney  Admission  Rule  6(b)(2)(A)  makes  clear  that  \nattorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct \n(FRPC).    Moreover,  the  choice-of-law  provisions  contained  within  the  relevant  state’s  rules  of  \nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.   \n1. FRPC 4-1.1 – Competence \n  FRPC  4-1.1  requires  that  a  lawyer  provide  competent  representation  to  a  client.\n200\n  \nCompetent  representation  requires  the  legal  knowledge,  skill,  thoroughness,  and  preparation  \nreasonably  necessary  for  the  representation.    A  comment  to  the  rule  clarifies  that  the  factors  \nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular matter include “the relative \ncomplexity  and  specialized  nature  of  the  matter,  the  lawyer’s  general  experience,  the  lawyer’s  \ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give \nthe matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer \nof established competence in the field.”  The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the \nrequired  proficiency  is  that  of  a  general  practitioner.”  With  respect  to  particular  matters,  \ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.  \nThe comment to Rule 4-1.1 explains that “[t]he required attention and preparation are determined \nin  part  by  what  is  at  stake;  major  litigation  and  complex  transactions  ordinarily  require  more  \nextensive treatment than matters of lesser complexity and consequence.” \n2. FRPC 4-1.3 – Diligence \n FRPC 4-1.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in \nrepresenting a client.  A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf \nof  a  client  despite  opposition,  obstruction,  or  personal  inconvenience  to  the  lawyer  and  take  \nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.”  A \nlawyer  must  exercise  “zeal”  in  advocating  for  the  client,  but  is  not  required  “to  press  for  every  \nadvantage that might be realized for a client.” \n3. FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others \n FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact \nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule \nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or \nomissions  that  are  the  equivalent  of  affirmative  false  statements,”  and  “[w]hether  a  particular  \nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” \n                                                 \n199\n  See also  28  U.S.C.  §  530B(a),  providing  that  government  attorneys  are  subject  to  state  laws  and  state  and  \nlocal federal court rules governing attorneys in each state where the government attorney engages in his duties. \n200\n  The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United \nStates.  See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Attorney); 28 C.F.R. § 0.5(b) (the Attorney General represents \nthe United States in legal matters). \n\n \n131 \n \n4. FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice \n FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \ndeceit, or misrepresentation.   \n FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice \nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   \n            In            Florida  Bar  v.  Frederick,  756  So.  2d  79,  87  (Fla.  2000),  the  court  noted  that  FRPC  \n4-8.4(d)  is  not  limited  to  conduct  that  occurs  in  a  judicial  proceeding,  but  can  be  applied  to  \n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.”  In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 41 So. 3d 166, 172 \n(Fla. 2010), for example, an attorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s \nmatter resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due \nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.\n201\n \n  \n                                                 \n201\n  OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor.  Nothing in the text of that rule, \nhowever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report.  A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has \nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.  \nThese “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors.  Indeed, the \nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional \ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for \ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.”  OPR does not consider \nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.     \n\n \n132 \n \n[Page Intentionally Left Blank] \n  \n\n \n133 \n \nCHAPTER TWO \nPART THREE:  ANALYSIS \n \nI. OVERVIEW \nFollowing  the  Miami  Herald  report  in  November  2018,  media  scrutiny  of  and  public  \nattention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated.  At the heart \nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s 18-month sentence, which resulted in a 13-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal \nconduct.    Although  many  records  have  been  released  as  part  of  civil  litigation  stemming  from  \nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making \nprocess leading to the signed NPA.  As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s \nmotivations  for  entering  into  the  NPA.    Publicly  released  communications  between  prosecutors  \nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the \nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because \nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships \nwith his attorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.    \nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the following core questions:  (1) who \nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its \nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules \nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by \nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism.  To the extent that available records and witness \ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shows in detail the process that led to the NPA, from \nthe  initial  complaint  to  the  USAO  through  the  intense  and  often  confusing  negotiation  process.    \nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive \ninterviews  of  subjects  and  witnesses,  OPR  is  able  to  answer  most  of  the  significant  questions  \nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development.  Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth \nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.   \nII. ACOSTA  REVIEWED  AND  APPROVED  THE  TERMS  OF  THE  NPA  AND  IS  \nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT  \nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knowledge of its terms.  He \nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate.  Acosta told OPR that \nhe  either  was  informed  of,  or  had  access  to  information  concerning,  the  underlying  facts  of  the  \ncase against Epstein.  OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled \nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta \ndid not make such a claim to OPR.  As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged \nresolution,  two  years  .  .  .  ,  registration  and  restitution,  .  .  .  ultimately  that  was  approved  on  my  \nauthority. . . .  [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I . . . accept that.  I’m not . . . pushing away \nresponsibility for it.”  \nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.  \nMenchel,  Sloman,  Lourie,  and  Villafaña  were  involved  in  the  matter  to  varying  degrees,  at  \n\n \n134 \n \ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions.  Menchel, for example, participated in \nformulating the USAO’s initial written offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions \nor  decisions  made  after  August  3,  2007.    Sloman  was  absent  during  part  of  the  most  intense  \nnegotiations  in  September  2007  and  did  not  see  the  final,  signed  version  of  the  NPA  until  he  \nreturned.  Villafaña and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions \nduring the September 12, 2007 meeting with the defense and State Attorney’s Office, or at least \nindicated  agreement  pending  Acosta’s  approval.    In  any  event,  whatever  the  level  of  Sloman’s,  \nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafaña’s involvement, they acted with the knowledge and approval of \nAcosta.   \nUnder  OPR’s  analytical  framework,  an  attorney  who  makes  a  good  faith  attempt  to  \nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given \nsituation does not commit professional misconduct.  Evidence that an attorney made a good faith \nattempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not \nlimited  to,  the  fact  that  the  attorney  consulted  with  a  supervisor.\n202\n    In  this  regard,  OPR’s  \nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars, \nwhich  specify  that  a  subordinate  lawyer  does  not  engage  in  misconduct  if  that  lawyer  acts  in  \naccordance  with  a  supervisory  lawyer’s  reasonable  resolution  of  an  arguable  question  of  \nprofessional duty.  See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b).  Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not \nfind  a  violation  of  a  clear  and  unambiguous  standard  as  discussed  below,  OPR  concludes  that  \nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña did not commit professional misconduct with respect to \nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval. \nIII. OPR  FOUND  THAT  NONE  OF  THE  SUBJECTS  VIOLATED  A  CLEAR  AND  \nUNAMBIGUOUS  STATUTE,  PROFESSIONAL  RESPONSIBILITY  RULE  OR  \nSTANDARD,     OR     DEPARTMENT     REGULATION     OR     POLICY,     IN     \nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA  \n A central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of \nthe  subjects,  in  developing,  negotiating,  or  entering  into  the  NPA,  violated  any  clear  and  \nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy.  OPR does not find professional \nmisconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous \nstandard.  OPR considered three specific areas:  (1) standards implicated by the decision to decline \na  federal  court  prosecution;  (2)  standards  implicated  by  the  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation  through  a  non-prosecution  agreement;  and  (3)  standards  implicated  by  any  of  the  \nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties.  As discussed \nbelow,  OPR  concludes  that  in  each  area,  and  in  the  absence  of  evidence  establishing  that  his  \ndecisions  were  based  on  corrupt  or  improper  influences,  the  U.S.  Attorney  possessed  broad  \ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates, \nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous \nstandard.    As  a  result,  OPR  concludes  that  none  of  the  subject  attorneys  violated  a  clear  and  \n                                                 \n202\n  The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate \nattorney has not acted in “good faith.”  OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did \nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision. \n\n \n135 \n \nunambiguous  standard  or  engaged  in  professional  misconduct  in  developing,  negotiating,  or  \nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.  \nA.  U.S.  Attorneys  Have  Broad  Discretion  to  Resolve  Investigations  or  Cases  as  \nThey  Deem  Appropriate,  and  Acosta’s  Decision  to  Decline  to  Prosecute  \nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct \nThe  U.S.  Attorneys  exercise  broad  discretion  in  enforcing  the  nation’s  criminal  laws.\n203\n    \nAs a general matter, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to \nhelp  him  discharge  his  constitutional  responsibility  to  ‘take  Care  that  the  Laws  be  faithfully  \nexecuted.’”  United  States  v.  Armstrong,  517  U.S.  456,  464  (1996)  (quoting  U.S.  Const.  art.  II,  \n§  3).    Unless  based  on  an  impermissible  standard  such  as  race,  religion,  or  other  arbitrary  \nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law \nor statute and are not subject to judicial review.  See United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 762 \n(1997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, \nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).   \nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case \nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular \nprosecutorial decision in any given case.”  USAM §§ 9-27.001, 9-27.120 (comment).  Rather than \nmandating  specific  actions,  the  USAM  identified  considerations  that  should  factor  into  a  \nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution \nin another jurisdiction.”  USAM § 9-27.220.  Importantly, U.S. Attorneys had “plenary authority \nwith regard to federal criminal matters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth \nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their \nindividual judicial districts.  USAM §§ 9-2.001, 9-27.140.  As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United \nStates Attorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Attorney General with the broadest \ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline \nprosecution.  USAM § 9-2.001.    \nIn  addition,  the  USAM  contemplated  that  federal  prosecutors  would  sometimes  decline  \nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance \nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other \njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute \neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other \njurisdiction.    USAM  §  9-27.240.\n204\n    A  comment  to  this  provision  stated  that  the  factors  are  \n“illustrative only, and the attorney for the government should also consider any others that appear \nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”   \n                                                 \n203\n  See,   e.g., Wayte,   470   U.S.   at   607;   United   States   v.   Goodwin,   457   U.S.   368,   380   n.11   (1982);   \nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 409. \n204\n  The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.240 to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is \ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to \nbring  a  federal  prosecution  based  on  conduct  substantially  the  same  as  that  involved  in  a  prior  state  or  federal  \nproceeding.  See USAM § 9-2.031.   \n\n \n136 \n \n  As  the  U.S.  Attorney,  and  in  the  absence  of  evidence  establishing  that  his  decision  was  \nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the \nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate.  As discussed in detail below, \nOPR  did  not  find  evidence  establishing  that  Acosta,  or  the  other  subjects,  were  motivated  or  \ninfluenced  by  improper  considerations.    Because  no  clear  and  unambiguous  standard  required  \nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the \nstate,  OPR  does  not  find  misconduct  based  on  Acosta’s  decision  to  decline  to  initiate  a  federal  \nprosecution of Epstein.     \nB.   No   Clear   and   Unambiguous   Standard   Precluded   Acosta’s   Use   of   a   \nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein  \n  OPR  found  no  statute  or  Department  policy  that  was  violated  by  Acosta’s  decision  to  \nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.   \nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through \na  non-prosecution  agreement  or  a  related  and  similar  mechanism,  a  deferred  prosecution  \nagreement.  United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  These agreements \n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal \nconviction  may  be  difficult  to  obtain  or  may  result  in  unwanted  collateral  consequences  for  a  \ndefendant  or  third  parties,  but  also  believes  that  the  defendant  should  not  evade  accountability  \naltogether.”  Id. at 738.  As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case \nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally \nwith the Executive” branch.  Id. at 741. \n OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case.  The USAM specifically \nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution \nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put \nthe  person  in  potential  criminal  jeopardy  and  when  alternatives  to  full  immunity  (such  as  \ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.”  USAM § 9-27.600 (comment).\n205\n  The \n“cooperation”  contemplated  was  cooperation  in  the  criminal  investigation  or  prosecution  of  \nanother person.  In certain circumstances, government attorneys were required to obtain approval \nfrom the appropriate Assistant Attorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement \nin exchange for cooperation.   \nEpstein, however, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the \nUSAM  was  silent  as  to  whether  a  prosecutor  could  use  a  non-prosecution  agreement  in  \ncircumstances  other  than  in  exchange  for  cooperation  in  the  investigation  or  prosecution  of  \nanother.    Notably,  although  the  USAM  provided  guidance  and  approval  requirements  in  cases  \ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other \nsituations.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous \nobligation  prohibiting  Acosta  from  ending  the  federal  investigation  through  a  non-prosecution  \n                                                 \n205\n    USAM  §  9-27.650  required  that  non-prosecution  agreements  in  exchange  for  cooperation  be  fully  \nmemorialized in writing.  Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied \nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.  \n\n \n137 \n \nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain \nDepartmental approval before doing so.  \nC.          The   NPA’s   Individual   Provisions   Did   Not   Violate   Any   Clear   and   \nUnambiguous Standards  \n Although Acosta, as U.S. Attorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a \nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a \nclear  and  unambiguous  standard  governed  any  of  the  individual  provisions  of  the  NPA.    \nSpecifically,   OPR   examined   Acosta’s   decision   to   permit   Epstein   to   resolve   the   federal   \ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution \nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an 18-month sentence of \nincarceration.    Because,  as  noted  above,  OPR  found  no  clear  guidance  applicable  to  non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating \nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements.  OPR also \nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,” \nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.  \nFinally,  OPR  considered  whether  there  was  a  clear  and  unambiguous  obligation  under  the  \nDepartment’s  policy  regarding  the  deportation  of  criminal  aliens,  which  would  have  required  \nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals. \n  After  considering  the  applicable  rules  and  policies,  OPR  finds  that  Acosta’s  decision  to  \nresolve  the  federal  investigation  through  the  NPA  did  not  violate  any  clear  and  unambiguous  \nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea \nand  through  the  terms  that  he  chose.    Accordingly,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta  did  not  commit  \nprofessional  misconduct  in  developing,  negotiating,  or  approving  the  NPA,  nor  did  the  other  \nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.\n206\n \n1. Acosta  Had  Authority  to  Approve  an  Agreement  That  Required  \nEpstein  to  Plead  to  Offenses  Resulting  in  an  18-Month  Term  of  \nIncarceration \n  Federal  prosecutors  have  discretion  to  resolve  a  pending  case  or  investigation  through  a  \nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.  \nUSAM   §§   9-27.330,   9-27.400;   see   also   Federal   Rule   of   Criminal   Procedure   11(c)(1).      \n                                                 \n206\n    OPR  also  considered  whether  Acosta,  Sloman,  Menchel,  Lourie,  or  Villafaña  failed  to  comply  with  \nprofessional ethics standards requiring that attorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a \nclient.  Attorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires \nthe legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.  See, e.g., FRPC \n4-1.1, 4-1.3.  The requirement of diligence obligates an attorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but \ndoes  not  require  the  attorney  “to  press  for  every  advantage  that  might  be  realized  for  a  client.”    See  FRPC  4-1.3  \n(comment).    Although  OPR  criticizes  certain  decisions  made  during  the  USAO’s  investigation  of  Epstein,  those  \ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence.  The subjects \nexhibited sufficient knowledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA \nnegotiations  to  satisfy  the  general  standards  established  by  the  professional  responsibility  rules.    An  attorney  may  \nattain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the \nrequirements of the standard. \n\n \n138 \n \nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most \nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal \nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes \nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect \nthe   investigation   or   prosecution   of   others.      See   USAM   §§   9-27.430,   9-27-300,   9-27.400   \n(comment).    The  genesis  of  this  policy,  the  Ashcroft  Memo,  specifically  requires  federal  \nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial \nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.  However, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important \nexception:  a U.S. Attorney or a “designated supervisory attorney” may authorize a plea that does \nnot  comport  with  this  policy.\n207\n    Moreover,  the  Ashcroft  Memo  explains  that  a  charge  is  not  \n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the \nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.   \n By its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily \nprovable  charge”  requirement.    The  draft  indictment  prepared  by  Villafaña  proposed  charging  \nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors, \nand  Epstein’s  sentencing  exposure  under  the  federal  guidelines  was  in  the  range  of  168  to  210  \nmonths’  imprisonment.    The  original  “term  sheet”  presented  to  the  defense  proposed  a  “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original \nstate  indictment,  with  a  joint,  binding  recommendation  for  a  two-year  term  of  incarceration.  \nInstead,  Epstein  was  permitted  to  resolve  his  federal  criminal  exposure  with  a  plea  to  the  state  \nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an 18-month sentence. \nAs  discussed  more  fully  later  in  this  Report,  Acosta,  Sloman,  Menchel,  and  Lourie  \nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafaña outlined in the prosecution \nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which \na federal prosecution would be premised.  On the other hand, Villafaña felt strongly that federal \ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice \nopined  that  the  charges  were  appropriate.    OPR  found  it  unnecessary  to  resolve  the  question  \nwhether  federal  charges  against  Epstein  were  readily  provable,  however,  because  Acosta  had  \n                                                 \n207\n    In  addition  to  specified  “Limited  Exceptions,”  this  authorization  is  available  in  “Other  Exceptional  \nCircumstances,” as follows:  \nProsecutors  may  decline  to  pursue  or  may  dismiss  readily  provable  charges  in  \nother  exceptional  circumstances  with  the  written  or  otherwise  documented  \napproval of an Assistant Attorney General, United States Attorney, or designated \nsupervisory attorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing \nReform  Act  must  be  sought  without  ignoring  the  practical  limitations  of  the  \nfederal criminal justice system.  For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss \ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Attorney’s \nOffice   is   particularly   over-burdened,   the   duration   of   the   trial   would   be   \nexceptionally  long,  and  proceeding  to  trial  would  significantly  reduce  the  total  \nnumber  of  cases  disposed  of  by  the  office.    However,  such  case-by-case  \nexceptions  should  be  rare;  otherwise  the  goals  of  fairness  and  equity  will  be  \njeopardized. \nAshcroft  Memo  at  §  I.B.6.    See  also  USAM  §§  9-2.001  and  27.140  (U.S.  Attorneys’  authority  to  depart  from  the  \nUSAM). \n\n \n139 \n \nauthority  to  deviate  from  the  Ashcroft  Memo’s  “most  serious  readily  provable  offense”  \nrequirement. \n Although Acosta could not recall specifically how or by whom the decision was made to \nallow Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or how \nor  by  whom  the  decision  was  made  to  reduce  the  sentencing  requirement  from  two  years  to  18  \nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes.  He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it \nwas signed.  Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding \nany  arguable  failure  to  comply  with  the  “most  serious  readily  provable  offense”  requirement.    \nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Attorney from deferring to a \nstate  prosecution,  so  it  is  not  clear  that  the  Memo’s  terms  apply  to  a  situation  involving  state  \ncharges.  Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that allowed Epstein \nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an 18-month state sentence did \nnot  violate  a  clear  and  unambiguous  standard  and  therefore  does  not  constitute  professional  \nmisconduct. \n2. The  USAO’s  Agreement  Not  to  Prosecute  Unidentified  “Potential  \nCo-Conspirators”   Did   Not   Violate   a   Clear   and   Unambiguous   \nDepartment Policy \n Several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute \nunidentified   “potential   co-conspirators”   amounted   to   “transactional   immunity,”   which   the   \nwitnesses  asserted  is  prohibited  by  Department  policy.    Although  “use  immunity”  protects  a  \nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of \nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from \nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.  \n OPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from declining to prosecute third parties \nor providing transactional immunity.  One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied \nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth \nAmendment privilege.  See USAM § 9-23.100 et seq.  Statutory provisions relating to immunity \nalso  address  the  same  context.    See  18  U.S.C.  §  6002;  21  U.S.C.  §  884.    Moreover,  apart  from  \nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not \nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  See, \ne.g., Marquez, 909 F.2d at 741-43; Kemp, 760 F.2d at 1248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 909; Frazier, \n697 So. 2d 945.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s \nagreement  not  to  prosecute  “potential  co-conspirators,”  and  therefore  cannot  conclude  that  \nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted \nprofessional misconduct. \n Notwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of \nAcosta’s  decision  to  approve  the  NPA  his  approval  of  this  provision  without  considering  its  \npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply. \n\n \n140 \n \n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation \nof Criminal Aliens  \n   During the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the \nUSAO  from  “request[ing],  initiat[ing],  or  in  any  way  encourag[ing]  immigration  authorities  to  \ninstitute  immigration  proceedings”  against  two  female  assistants.    However,  OPR  considered  \nwhether  the  April  28,  1995  memorandum  imposed  any  obligation  on  the  USAO  to  prosecute  \nEpstein’s two female assistants who were known to be foreign nationals—as Villafaña urged in \nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded \nthe  USAO  from  agreeing  not  to  prosecute  them  as  part  of  a  negotiated  resolution.    OPR  found  \nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.    \n The Attorney General’s April 28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal \nAliens”  directed  federal  prosecutors  to  become  involved  actively  and  directly  in  the  process  of  \nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.520, provided that \n“[a]ll  deportable  criminal  aliens  should  be  deported  unless  extraordinary  circumstances  exist.”    \nHowever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that \nwould have triggered their removal.  But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed \nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did \neither  provision  preclude  the  USAO  from  declining  to  prosecute  an  alien  using  the  same  broad  \ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions. \n      The  policy  guidance  also  requires  “prompt  and  close  coordination”  with  immigration  \nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration \nauthorities  before  engaging  in  plea  negotiations  with  alien  defendants.    OPR  learned  during  its  \ninvestigation  that  an  ICE  agent  participated  in  the  Epstein  investigation  in  its  early  stages.    \nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants, \nwho,  in  any  event,  had  not  been  charged  and  were  therefore  not  “defendants,”  no  further  \nnotification was required.   \nIV. THE  EVIDENCE  DOES  NOT  ESTABLISH  THAT  THE  SUBJECTS  WERE  \nINFLUENCED  BY  IMPROPER  MOTIVES  TO  INCLUDE  IN  THE  NPA  TERMS  \nFAVORABLE  TO  EPSTEIN  OR  TO  OTHERWISE  EXTEND  BENEFITS  TO  \nEPSTEIN   \n            OPR  investigated  whether  any of  the  subjects—Acosta,  Sloman,  Menchel,  Lourie,  or  \nVillafaña—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth, \nstatus,  or  political  associations,  to  include  terms  in  the  NPA  that  were  favorable  to  Epstein,  or  \nwhether  such  motives  otherwise  affected  the  outcome  of  the  federal  investigation.    OPR  \nconsidered  the  case-specific  reasons  the  subjects  identified  as  the  motivation  for  the  USAO’s  \nJuly  31,  2007  “term  sheet”  and  Acosta’s  approval  of  the  NPA  in  September  2007.    OPR  also  \nthoroughly  examined  various  factors  forming  the  basis  for  allegations  that  the  subjects  were  \nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense \ncounsel;  the  subjects’  numerous  meetings  with  Epstein’s  team  of  nationally  known  attorneys;  \nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafaña—and defense counsel that appeared friendly, \ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining \n\n \n141 \n \nto  prosecute  all  of  Epstein’s  co-conspirators.    These  factors  are  analyzed  in  the  following  \ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.   \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  OPR’s  investigation  of  the  subjects’  decisions  and  actions  in  the  \nEpstein matter uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or \npersonal consideration.  In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary \nrecord,  interviewed  witnesses,  and  questioned  the  subject  attorneys.    The  evidence  shows  three  \nsets  of  issues  influenced  Acosta’s  decision  to  resolve  the  case  through  the  NPA.    The  first—of  \nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.  \nThe  second  arose  from  an  assessment  by  Acosta’s  senior  advisers—Sloman,  Menchel,  and  \nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what \nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.\n208\n  \nThe  third  was  Acosta’s  aim  of  obtaining  a  greater  measure  of  justice  for  victims  of  Epstein’s  \nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.    \nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did \nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit \nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth, \nstatus,  or  associations.    That  is  not  to  say  that  Epstein  received  no  benefit  from  his  enormous  \nwealth.    He  was  able  to  hire  nationally  known  attorneys  who  had  prestige,  skill,  and  extensive  \nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations.  He had the resources \nto  finance  an  aggressive  approach  to  the  case  that  included  the  preparation  of  multiple  written  \nsubmissions  reflecting  extensive  research  and  analysis,  as  well  as  multiple  in-person  meetings  \ninvolving several of his attorneys and USAO personnel.  He assembled a defense team well versed \nin  the  USAO  and  the  Department,  with  the  knowledge  to  maneuver  through  the  Department’s  \nvarious levels and offices, a process unknown to many criminal defense attorneys and infrequently \nused  even  by  those  familiar  with  the  Department’s  hierarchy.    Access  to  highly  skilled  and  \nprominent attorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or \ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes \nor  violent  offenses.    Nonetheless,  while  recognizing  that  Epstein’s  wealth  played  a  role  in  the  \noutcome  because  he  was  able  to  hire  skilled  and  assertive  attorneys,  OPR  concludes  that  the  \nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper \nfactors.      \nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity, \nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration   \nSome  public  criticism  of  the  USAO’s  handling  of  the  Epstein  matter  implied  that  the  \nsubjects’  decisions  or  actions  may  have  been  motivated  by  criminal  corruption,  although  no  \nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified.  Throughout its investigation, \n                                                 \n208\n  Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about \nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his attorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report \nthat  OPR  should  not  attribute  to  Sloman  any  input  in  Acosta’s  decisions  about  how  to  resolve  the  case.    However,  \nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated \nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted \nin determining how to resolve the Epstein investigation.     \n\n \n142 \n \nOPR was attentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or \nother  illegal  political  or  personal  considerations,  and  found  no  such  indication.\n209\n    Witnesses,  \nincluding  law  enforcement  officials,  were  specifically  asked  whether  they  had  any  information  \nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same \nwitnesses of the Epstein matter’s outcome—stated that they did not.  Specifically, the FBI case \nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had \nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit.  The co-case \nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they \nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the matter because of illegal factors such \nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately \nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.  \nB. Contemporaneous Written Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did \nNot   Reveal   Evidence   Establishing   That   the   Subjects   Were   Improperly   \nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations  \n  Although  Epstein’s  name  is  now  nationally  recognized,  in  2006  and  2007,  he  was  not  a  \nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well known in Florida.  All five subjects told OPR that \nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.  Similarly, the FBI case \nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of \nEpstein,  and  other  witnesses  also  told  OPR  that  they  were  initially  unfamiliar  with  Epstein.    \nHowever,  news  reports  about  Epstein’s  July  2006  arrest  on  the  state  indictment,  which  were  \ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm \nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey, \nand Alan Dershowitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”\n210\n  Villafaña, \nLourie,  Sloman,  and  Acosta  learned  of  this  press  coverage  early  in  the  investigation,  and  thus  \nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.\n211\n   The FBI case \nagent  also  told  OPR  that  “we  knew  who  had  been  on  his  plane,  we  knew  .  .  .  some  of  his  \nconnections.”   \n1. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing \nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors \n  OPR  found  no  evidence  in  the  extensive  contemporaneous  documentary  record  that  the  \nterms  of  the  NPA  resulted  from  improper  factors,  such  as  Epstein’s  wealth  or  influential  \nconnections.  Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence \nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison, \nbut  the  USAO  insisted  that  Epstein  serve  a  term  of  incarceration.    Defense  counsel  mentioned  \nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA letter, but that reference was made in the context of a \n                                                 \n209\n  OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.  If OPR had found \nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the matter to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.   \n210\n  Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2006; \nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2006.   \n211\n  Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial \nprosecution memorandum.   \n\n \n143 \n \nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s \nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the \ndefense argument that the matter should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.\n212\n  The defense \nsubmission to the Deputy Attorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection \nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and \nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his \nassociation with the former President.\n213\n   \n2. The  Subjects  Asserted  That  They  Were  Motivated  by  Reasonable  \nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences \n  In  addition  to  reviewing  the  documentary  evidence,  OPR  questioned  the  five  subject  \nattorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making \ndecisions  regarding  the  investigation,  in  the  decision  to  resolve  the  case  through  an  NPA,  or  in  \nnegotiating  the  NPA.    Villafaña,  in  particular,  was  concerned  from  the  outset  of  the  federal  \ninvestigation  that  Epstein  might  try  to  employ  against  the  USAO  the  same  pressure  that  she  \nunderstood  had  been  used  with  the  State  Attorney’s  Office,  and  she  proactively  took  steps  to  \ncounter  Epstein’s  possible  influence  by  meeting  with  Acosta  and  Sloman  to  sensitize  them  to  \nEpstein’s tactics.  Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving \nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case.  Acosta told OPR, “[W]e \ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . how wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to \ndo this because he is so wealthy.”  Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not \nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.”  Lourie \ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case, \nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that \nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.  \nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents, \nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently \nbecause  of  his  wealth.    The  CEOS  Chief  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  recall  anyone  at  the  USAO  \nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth \nand influence.   \n    OPR  takes  note  of  but  does  not  consider  dispositive  the  absence  of  any  affirmative  \nevidence  that  the  subjects  were  acting  from  improper  motivations  or  their  denial  of  such  \nmotivations.    Of  more  significance,  and  as  discussed  more  fully  below,  was  the  fact  that  \ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge \nresolution  was  based  on  various  case-specific  legal  and  factual  considerations.\n214\n  OPR also \n                                                 \n212\n  In the pre-NPA letter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable \nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel \nalso  noted  that  the  former  President  had  been  quoted  by  New  York  Magazine  describing  Epstein  as  “a  committed  \nphilanthropist.”    \n213\n    In  the  letter  to  the  Deputy  Attorney  General,  counsel  suggested  that  the  prosecution  may  have  been  \n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”   \n214\n  OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors \nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.  Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and \nVillafaña all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with \n\n \n144 \n \nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring \nEpstein  to  serve  time  in  jail,  register  as  a  sexual  offender,  and  provide  monetary  damages  to  \nvictims—had  been  made  by  July  31,  2007,  when  the  USAO  presented  its  “term  sheet”  to  the  \ndefense.  This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated \nany  plans  to  do  so.    It  also  was  well  before  Acosta’s  October  12,  2007  breakfast  meeting  with  \ndefense  counsel  Lefkowitz,  which  received  strong  public  and  media  criticism.    OPR  also  \nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course \nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end \nfederal involvement altogether and return the matter to the state authorities to handle as they saw \nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender, \ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.    \n3. Subject   and   Witness   Interviews   and   Contemporaneous   Records   \nIdentified  Case-Specific  Considerations  Relating  to  Evidence,  Legal  \nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims \n Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content \nof  discussions  about  the  challenges  presented  by  a  potential  federal  prosecution  or  reasons  for  \nAcosta’s  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  investigation  through  the  NPA,  but  they  and  Villafaña  \nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that \neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely \ninfluenced   Acosta’s   decision-making.      These   considerations   included   assessment   of   the   \nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims.  For the most part, however, \nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge \ndisposition,  but  do  not  directly  explain  why  Acosta  chose  to  resolve  the  federal  investigation  \nthrough a guilty plea in state court.  That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns \nabout  intruding  into  an  area  he  believed  was  traditionally  handled  by  state  law  enforcement  \nauthorities.   \nIn  a  declaration  submitted  to  the  district  court  in  2017  in  connection  with  the  CVRA  \nlitigation,  Villafaña  explained  the  USAO’s  rationale  for  terminating  the  federal  investigation  \nthrough the NPA: \nPrior  to  the  Office  making  its  decision  to  direct  me  to  engage  in  \nnegotiations  with  Epstein’s  counsel,  I  discussed  the  strengths  and  \nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management, \nand   informed   them   that   most   of   the   victims   had   expressed   \nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. . . .  It is \nmy  understanding  from  these  and  other  discussions  that  these  \nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and \nthe  various  competing  interests  of  the  many  different  victims  \n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with \nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration \nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims, \n                                                 \nAcosta  to  improperly  benefit  Epstein  or  would  have  remained  silent  if  they  suspected  that  Acosta,  or  any  of  their  \ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.    \n\n \n145 \n \nand  guaranteed  sexual  offender  registration  by  Epstein  .  .  .  were  \namong the factors [that led to the NPA].\n215\n \nDuring her OPR interview, Villafaña similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to \ngo forward with a trial: \n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them how they \nwanted the case to be resolved.  And most of them wanted the case \nto  be  resolved  via  a  plea.    Some  of  them  wanted  him  not  to  be  \nprosecuted  at  all.    Most  of  them  did  not  want  to  have  to  come  to  \ncourt  and  testify.    They  were  very  worried  about  their  privacy  \nrights.\n216\n   \nIn his written response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall \nthe issues Villafaña set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the \nUSAO in 2007.  Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about \nthe charges and a potential trial: \n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there \nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on \nappeal  after  a  conviction,  resulting  in  no  jail  time,  no  criminal  \n                                                 \n215\n   Doe  v.  United  States,  No.  9:08-cv-80736  (S.D.  Fla.),  Declaration  of  A.  Marie  Villafaña  in  Support  of  \nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for \nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2017). \n216\n  These concerns are also reflected in a 2017 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation, \nin  which  she  stated,  “During  interviews  conducted  from  2006  to  2008,  no  victims  expressed  a  strong  opinion  that  \nEpstein be prosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   \nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims . . . .  \nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their \nidentities to the public.  A number of the victims raised concerns about having to \ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  \nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible \nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, many of the \nvictims  were  troubled  about  the  existence  of  the  investigation.    They  displayed  \nfeelings   of   embarrassment   and   humiliation   and   were   reluctant   to   talk   to   \ninvestigators.  Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused \neven to speak to us.  Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and getting to \nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation. \n  In addition, during the CVRA litigation, an attorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect \nthe  anonymity  of  his  clients  by  preventing  disclosure  of  their  identities  to  the  CVRA  petitioners.    See Response to \nCourt Order of July 6, 2015 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2015).  It is noteworthy that in \n2020, when OPR attempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to written questions \nregarding  contacts  with  the  USAO,  OPR  was  informed  that  most  of  the  victims  were  still  deeply  concerned  about  \nremaining  anonymous.    One  victim  described  to  OPR  how  she  became  distraught  when,  during  the  USAO’s  \ninvestigation,  the  FBI  left  a  business  card  at  her  parents’  home  and,  as  a  result,  her  parents  learned  that  she  was  a  \nvictim of Epstein.  At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her \nparents to know about the case.   \n\n \n146 \n \nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of \nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed \nand  the  general  difficulties  of  a  trial  for  the  victims  and  their  \nfamilies. \nAlthough  his  emails  showed  that,  at  the  time,  he  advocated  for  prosecution  of  Epstein,  \nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the \nmatter  had  expressed  concerns  at  various  times  about  the  long-term  viability  of  a  federal  \nprosecution  of  Epstein  due  to  certain  factual  and  legal  hurdles,  as  well  as  issues  with  the  \ncooperation and desires of the victims.”  \n  Similarly,  Menchel—who  had  experience  prosecuting  sexual  assault  crimes—recalled  \nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced \nadditional  trauma  as  a  result  of  a  trial,  and  some  had  made  statements  exonerating  Epstein.    \nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein, \nEpstein would have elected to go to trial.  In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh \nthe  risk  of  losing  at  trial,  and  thereby  re-traumatizing  the  victims,  against  the  benefits  gained  \nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual \noffender, and made restitution to his victims.   \nSloman   also   recalled   witness   challenges   and   concerns   about   the   viability   of   the   \ngovernment’s legal theories.  He told OPR:   \n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going \nto be reliable.  You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to \nbe  severely  impeached.    People  who  loved  Jeffrey  Epstein  who  \nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I \nwas 18 years old.   \nYou  had  witnesses  who  were  scared  to  death  of  the  public  light  \nbeing shown on them because their parents didn’t even know -- had \nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns. \n \n Acosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’ \ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which \nfactored  into  the  resolution.    He  acknowledged  that  his  understanding  of  the  facts  was  not  \n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony, \nbut   he   trusted   that   his   “team”   had   already   “done   the   diligence   necessary”   to   make   \nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case.  Acosta recalled discussing the facts \nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding \nof  the  facts  as  Villafaña.    Nevertheless,  OPR  credits  Acosta’s  statement  that  he  reasonably  \nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose \nsignificant evidentiary challenges.   \nOther  witnesses  corroborated  the  subjects’  testimony  regarding  witness  challenges,  \nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims \nhad  expressed  concern  for  their  safety  and  “a  lot  of  them  d[id]n’t  want  to  take  the  stand,  and  \n\n \n147 \n \nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.”\n217\n  The co-case agent told OPR that one \nof  the  “strategies”  for  dealing  with  the  victims’  fear  was  “to  keep  them  off  the  stand,”  and  he  \ngenerally  remembered  discussions  about  resolving  the  Epstein  case  in  a  way  that  protected  the  \nvictims’ identities.  In addition, the CEOS Trial Attorney who briefly worked with Villafaña on \nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she \nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward.  The CEOS \nTrial  Attorney  told  OPR  that  “[the  victims]  would  have  testified,”  but  would  have  required  an  \nextensive  amount  of  “victim  management”  because  they  were  “deeply  embarrassed”  about  \npotentially being labeled as prostitutes.  The CEOS Trial Attorney also told OPR that “there were \nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.\n218\n \n  The  contemporaneous  records  also  reflect  discussions  of,  or  references  to,  various  legal  \nand factual issues or other concerns about the case.  For example, in an early email to Menchel, \nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafaña’s proposed charges were whether the USAO \ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some \nminor victims had told Epstein they were 18.  He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there \nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafaña’s prosecution memorandum] as this is \nuncharted territory to some degree.”  In his July 5, 2007 email to Villafaña, Menchel cited Acosta’s \nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal \nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.”  Defense counsel raised \nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous letters to the USAO.  Defense submissions \nattacked  the  legal  theories  for  a  federal  prosecution  and  detailed  factors  that  could  have  \nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of \nvictim  drug  and  alcohol  use,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  some  victims  recruited  other  victims  and  \npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages. \nAcosta  also  recalled  that  although  his  “team”  had  expressed  concern  about  the  “trial  \nissues,” his own focus had been on “the legal side of things.”  Notably, during his prior tenure as \nthe Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had \nbeen  involved  in  efforts  to  address  sex  trafficking.    He  told  OPR  that  one  of  the  “background  \nissues”  that  the  Civil  Rights  Division  addressed  under  his  leadership,  and  which  influenced  his  \nview  of  the  Epstein  case,  was  the  distinction  between  sex  trafficking  and  solicitation  of  \nprostitution.  Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable \nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a matter \nof  state  concern,  and  sex  trafficking,  which  remained  a  developing  area  of  federal  interest  in  \n2007.\n219\n \n                                                 \n217\n  In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2007, when he located a \nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “know Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved \naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”  \n218\n  In April 2007, a victim who was represented by an attorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded \ninterview with the FBI, with her attorney and his investigator present.  This victim denied being involved in, or being \na victim of, criminal activity.  Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”   \n219\n  In his March 20, 2011 letter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast, \nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.”    Most \nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved \n\n \n148 \n \n  The  USAO  might  have  been  able  to  surmount  the  evidentiary,  legal,  and  policy  issues  \npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein.  Villafaña, in particular, believed she could have \nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly \nrecommended  declaring  Epstein  in  breach  and  proceeding  with  an  indictment,  because  she  \ncontinued  to  have  confidence  in  the  case.\n220\n    Oosterbaan  and  others  also  believed  that  the  \ngovernment would succeed at trial.  Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group.  Some of \nthem  were  afraid  of  testifying  or  having  their  identities  made  public;  others  wanted  Epstein  \nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear how many expressed a willingness to testify at a \ntrial;  and  still  others  provided  information  favorable  to  Epstein.    In  the  end,  Acosta  assumed  \nresponsibility  for  deciding  how  to  resolve  the  Epstein  investigation  and  weighing  the  risks  and  \nbenefits  of  a  trial  versus  those  of  a  pre-charge  disposition.    His  determination  that  a  pre-charge  \ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.   \nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about \nwinning  a  potential  trial  and  why  the  USAO  would  have  sought  some  sort  of  pre-charge  \ndisposition,  they  do  not  fully  explain  why  Acosta  decided  to  pursue  a  state-based  resolution  as  \nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement.  OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records \na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a \nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.   \nAccording to Acosta, “In 2006, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States \nAttorney’s  Office  to  become  involved  in  a  state  solicitation  case,  even  one  involving  underage  \nteens,”  because  solicitation  was  “the  province  of  state  prosecutors.”    Acosta  told  OPR  that  he  \ndeveloped  “a  preference  for  deferring  to  the  state”  to  “make  it  clear  that  [the  USAO  was]  not  \nstepping on something that is a purely local matter, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for \nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.”  Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding \nthat  the  PBPD  would  not  have  brought  the  case  to  federal  investigators  if  the  State  Attorney’s  \nOffice  had  pursued  a  sanction  against  Epstein  that  included  jail  time  and  sexual  offender  \nregistration.  Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest \ninjustice”  that,  in  Acosta’s  view,  would  have  resulted  from  the  state’s  original  plea  proposal.    \nAcosta acknowledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have \nviewed  the  terms  set  out  in  the  NPA  as  a  satisfactory  result,  but  it  was  adequate  to  serve  as  a  \n“backstop”   to   the   state’s   prosecution,   which   he   described   as   “a   polite   way   of   saying[,   \n‘]encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]”  In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case \nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial, \nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration \nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”  \nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both \ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had \n                                                 \nthe terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.  Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have \nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.   \n220\n  Sloman told OPR that Villafaña “always believed in the case.”    \n\n \n149 \n \nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.\n221\n  Sloman told OPR that although he did not \nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite \npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping \nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Attorney’s Office that \nwas resolved by the State Attorney’s Office at some level.”  During his OPR interview, Menchel \nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried \nabout  “the  impact  that  taking  the  case  in  federally  may  have  on  .  .  .  other  programs,”  although  \nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.   \nC. Other  Significant  Factors  Are  Inconsistent  with  a  Conclusion  That  the  \nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences \nOPR  considered  additional  aspects  of  the  Epstein  case  that  were  inconsistent  with  a  \nsuggestion  that  Acosta’s  decision  to  offer  the  July  31,  2007  terms  was  driven  by  corruption,  a  \ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.   \nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was \nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him.  The NPA \nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism \nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the matter had been abandoned \nand  sent  back  to  the  state  for  whatever  result  state  authorities  deemed  appropriate.    Epstein’s  \nattorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation \nand  that  his  conduct  was  exclusively  a  matter  of  state  concern.    If  the  USAO  had  declined  to  \nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would \nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior.  Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely \nwould have received a sentence of probation.  Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on \nthe  wrist,”  with  “no  jail  time,  no  felony  sex  offense,  no  sexual  offender  registration,  [and]  no  \nrestitution for the victims.”  Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, however, the USAO devised \na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address \nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the \nstate’s  original  charge,  standing  alone,  would  have  done.    Acosta’s  affirmative  decision  to  \nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather \nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that \nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.\n222\n  Similarly, despite defense counsel’s \nrepeated  requests  to  eliminate  the  sexual  offender  registration  requirement,  Acosta  refused  to  \n                                                 \n221\n  Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was \nnot.”  Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”   \n222\n  Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain” \nby showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.”  Villafaña \nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense attorney who argued in one meeting that— \nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish.  We then pointed out that \na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish.  Then he \nsaid,  well  we’re  prosecuting  him  because  he  was  a  Democrat.    And  again,  we  \npointed out that a number of us were Democrats.  So then it went to, we were \nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. . . .  That one didn’t work so well. \n\n \n150 \n \nreconsider the provision.  Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely \nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s attorneys.     \n  Second,  Epstein  himself  was  not  satisfied  with  the  NPA.    Immediately  after  signing  the  \nagreement,  he  sought  to  have  the  Department  nullify  it  by  declaring  federal  involvement  in  the  \ninvestigation inappropriate.  In addition to repeatedly attacking the NPA in his submissions to the \nDepartment,  Epstein  added  to  his  evidentiary  challenges  and  federalism  claims  allegations  of  \nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel.  Epstein’s dissatisfaction \nwith  the  NPA,  and  his  personal  attacks  on  individual  prosecutors  involved  in  negotiating  the  \nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s \nbenefit.   \nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense \nCounsel,   Decisions   to   Meet   with   Defense   Counsel,   and   Other   Factors   \nEstablished  That  the  Subjects  Acted  from  Improper  Influences  or  Provided  \nImproper Benefits to Epstein  \nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media \naccounts  to  show  that  the  subjects  provided  improper  benefits  to  Epstein  or  which  purportedly  \nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences.  OPR examined these factors but did \nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other \nimproper motivation.    \n1. The  Evidence  Does  Not  Establish  That  the  Subjects  Extended  Any  \nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships \nwith His Attorneys \n  Epstein’s  wealth  enabled  him  to  hire  multiple  attorneys  who  had  preexisting  personal  \nconnections  to  some  of  the  government  attorneys  involved  in  his  case,  in  the  State  Attorney’s  \nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department.  Based on the attorneys Epstein selected \nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring attorneys \nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him.  One of the first attorneys who \ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Attorney \nfor the Southern District of Florida.  Villafaña and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was \nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners.  Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former \nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized.  Later, when Epstein \nwas  seeking  Acosta’s  personal  involvement  in  the  case,  Epstein  hired  Kenneth  Starr  and  Jay  \nLefkowitz, prominent attorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from \nhis previous employment with that firm.   \nVillafaña told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s \nattorneys.”  Critically, however, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in \nthe  following  subsection,  neither  Villafaña  nor  any  of  the  other  individuals  OPR  interviewed  \nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an \nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or \nfor  any  other  improper  reason).    Villafaña  explained  how,  in  her  view,  the  “legal  prowess”  of  \nEpstein’s attorneys had an impact on the case:  \n\n \n151 \n \n[O]ne  of  the  issues  in  the  case  was  the  .  .  .  defense’s  ability  to  \ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.  \nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.  But because \nthey  were  able  to  convince  members  of  our  office  that  it  was  \nsomehow  extremely  novel  and  legally  complex,  the  issue  became  \nwho  was  likely  to  succeed  in  arguing  these  legal  issues.    And  \nbecause  of  that,  the  legal  prowess,  if  you  will,  of  the  attorneys  [  ]  \n[became] something to consider. \n . . . . \n \nI  think  that  the  ability  of  Alan  Dershowitz  and  Ken  Starr  and  Jay  \nLefkowitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t know what I was \ntalking  [about]  also,  all  came  into  play.    So  I  think  there  were  a  \nnumber of factors and it all came together. \nAlthough  Villafaña  was  critical  of  Acosta’s  consideration  of  the  defense  arguments,  she  \nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy.  Certainly, throughout \nthe  case,  Epstein’s  attorneys  prepared  lengthy  memoranda  analyzing  the  evidence  and  arguing  \nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes, \nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to \ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.   \n  There  is  little  question  that  Epstein’s  extensive  team  of  attorneys  was  able  to  obtain  \nnegotiated  benefits  for  Epstein—although  the  USAO  never  wavered  from  its  three  core  \nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein \ncertain  other  concessions  during  the  negotiations.    Epstein’s  wealth  provided  him  with  skilled,  \nexperienced  negotiators  who  continually  sought  various  incremental  concessions,  and  with  \nattorneys  who  knew  how  to  obtain  Department  review  of  a  USAO  matter,  thereby  delaying  \nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.\n223\n  Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, however, OPR \ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’ \nrelationships with the attorneys he had selected to represent him. \n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel \nDid Not Influence Their Actions \nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did \nnot  affect  his  handling  of  the  case.    Menchel  told  OPR  that  once  in  private  practice,  former  \ncolleagues  often  became  adversaries.    In  Menchel’s  view,  such  preexisting  relationships  were  \nuseful because they afforded a defense attorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a \nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense attorney to “tailor” \narguments  in  a  way  that  would  maximize  their  persuasive  impact  on  the  USAO.    Menchel  told  \nOPR,  however,  that  these  advantages  did  not  “move  the  needle  in  any  major  way,”  and  he  \n“reject[ed]  the  notion”  that  anyone  in  the  USAO  had  been  “swayed”  because  of  preexisting  \n                                                 \n223\n  As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many \nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”     \n\n \n152 \n \nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s attorneys.  In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and \nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s attempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as \n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”  \n Sloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis \nand  Lewis’s  law  partner,  he  was  unaware  of  personal  relationships  between  any  of  his  other  \ncolleagues  and  any  of  Epstein’s  attorneys,  but  that  in  any  event  his  attitude  regarding  cases  \ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches \nwith them.”  In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the \nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be \nbest for the case.   \n Lourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s attorneys “didn’t influence \nanything.”  Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s \nProfessional  Responsibility  Officer  about  the  propriety  of  his  role  as  a  supervisor  in  the  \ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law \npartner.  OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility \nOfficer’s  advice  as  an  indication  that  he  was  alert  to  his  ethical  responsibilities  regarding  \nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.   \nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on \nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages \nfor  the  victims—before  he  engaged  directly  with  any  of  Epstein’s  attorneys  and  before  Epstein  \nadded Starr and Lefkowitz, the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys, to his team.  Acosta pointed out that \nthe  USAO  continued  to  insist  on  a  resolution  that  satisfied  all  three  of  those  criteria  even  after  \nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.   \nAcosta  took  other  actions  that  appear  inconsistent  with  an  intent  to  benefit  Starr  and  \nLefkowitz.    On  several  occasions,  when  directly  appealed  to  by  Lefkowitz  or  Starr,  he  directed  \nthem  to  address  their  communications  to  Villafaña,  Sloman,  and  other  subordinates.    After  his  \nOctober  12,  2007  breakfast  meeting  with  Lefkowitz,  Acosta  immediately  communicated  with  \nSloman about their conversation.  In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and \nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest \nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein matter.  On Acosta’s \nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department \napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible \nemployment”  with  Kirkland  &  Ellis.    These  actions  support  Acosta’s  assertion  that  he  was  \ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.\n224\n   \n                                                 \n224\n  In addition, in May 2008, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s \nProfessional  Responsibility  Officer  about  whether  Acosta  should  recuse  from  the  Epstein  matter  because  he  was  \nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2009, and Dershowitz—a Harvard Law School \nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic \nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as \na visiting professor.”  The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.   \n\n \n153 \n \n In its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email written by Villafaña in \n2018, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year \nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel \nas a favor to defense attorney Sanchez.  OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and \ndetermined that there was no merit to it.  Specifically, in December 2018, after the Miami Herald \ninvestigative  report  renewed  public  attention  to  the  case,  Villafaña  recounted  in  an  email  to  a  \nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.\n225\n  In the \nemail,  Villafaña  stated  that  she  had  not  been  a  participant  in  discussions  that  led  to  Acosta’s  \ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the following:  “Months (or possibly years) \nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from.  He said \nthat  Lily  [sic]  Ann  Sanchez  (attorney  for  Epstein)  asked  Mr.  Menchel  to  ‘do  her  a  solid’  and  \nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”   \nOPR questioned both Villafaña and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.  \nVillafaña told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends.  During her \nOPR interview, Villafaña explained:   \n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff.  I said, you know, “Jeff, where did this two \nyears come from?”  And he said, “Well, I always figured that . . . \nLilly  asked  Matt  to  do  her  a  solid,”  which  I  thought  was  such  a  \nstrange term, . . . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in \nEpstein’s  good  graces”  and  that  that’s  where  the  two  years  came  \nfrom.  Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff \nSloman  asked  me  where  the  two  years  came  from,  and  I  had  to  \nremind him of that conversation.  So Jeff doesn’t know where the \ntwo years came from. \nBecause  the  email  had  been  expressed  in  more  definitive  terms,  OPR  asked  Villafaña  \nwhether  Sloman  had  affirmatively  asserted  that  the  two-year  deal  was  a  favor  from  Menchel  to  \ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafaña \ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said.  At a follow-up interview, Villafaña again said \nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Matt to do her \na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Matt just wanted . . . to do her a solid.”  Villafaña stated \nthat  she  was  unaware  of  any  information  that  “expressly  [indicated]  that  there  was  any  sort  of  \nexchange of . . . a favor in either direction.” \n During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could \nnot rule out the possibility that Villafaña, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard \nthat in some fashion.”  He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafaña about Menchel having \ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s \nnot something that I would have believed.  Him doing her a solid.  I mean that’s the furthest thing \nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”   \n                                                 \n225\n  Villafaña’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein \ninvestigation  and  the  NPA,  to  which  the  USAO  had  been  asked  to  assist  in  responding.    In  her  email,  Villafaña  \naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.   \n\n \n154 \n \n  Menchel  told  OPR  that  when  he  and  Sanchez  were  in  the  USAO,  they  had  a  social  \nrelationship, which included, in 2003, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks.  We \ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\n226\n  \nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was known \nin the office at the time.  Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically” \nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein \ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely” \nhave been at office events and when she attended his wedding.\n227\n  Menchel added, “[T]hat was \nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s \nthought.”  \nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term \nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did \nnot recall how the office arrived at that figure.  In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that \nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case.  Moreover, \nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was \nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.   \nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements \nto  OPR  from  Menchel,  Villafaña,  Sloman,  and  Acosta,  and  concludes  that  there  is  no  evidence  \nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.  \nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26, \n2007, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal \ncase  with  a  state  plea  that  required  jail  time  and  sexual  offender  registration.    According  to  the  \nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense.  In the lengthy email exchange with Villafaña in \nearly July 2007, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution \nwas made with Acosta’s “full knowledge.”  Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that \nalthough  he  did  not  remember  a  specific  conversation  with  Menchel  concerning  a  state-based  \nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense \ncounsel  “without  having  discussed  it  with  me.”\n228\n    Moreover,  the  defense  did  not  immediately  \n                                                 \n226\n  Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2007, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated \nSanchez.    OPR  questioned  the  USAO’s  Professional  Responsibility  Officer  regarding  whether  Menchel  had  an  \nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship.  The Professional Responsibility Officer said that it \nwould depend on “how long the relationship was and how compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,” \nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta.  The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR \nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity \nof the [Epstein] matter, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it \nover.”    Menchel  told  OPR  that  if  his  relationship  with  Sanchez  had  turned  into  something  more  than  a  handful  of  \ndates, he would have advised his supervisors.  Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with \nSanchez  influenced  the  Epstein  investigation,  OPR  assesses  that  it  would  have  been  prudent  for  Menchel  to  have  \ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in \nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality. \n227\n  Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early \n2006, after she left the USAO.   \n228\n  In addition, Villafaña recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2007 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer \na two year state deal.”    \n\n \n155 \n \naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of \nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and \ndid  not  view  it  as  such.    The  defense  had  previously  rejected  the  state’s  offer  of  a  sentence  of  \nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail \nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early \nstages of the negotiations.     \n As discussed below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the \nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to \nany other term of years.  Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of \nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.  \nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of \nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later.  Sloman, the \npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly \ndisputed  that  the  email  accurately  reflected  either  the  reason  for  the  two-year  proposal  or  his  \nunderstanding  of  that  reason.    Villafaña  herself  could  remember  little  about  the  critical  \nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.  \nGiven  the  lack  of  any  corroborating  evidence,  and  the  evidence  showing  Epstein’s  vigorous  \nresistance  to  the  proposal,  OPR  concludes  that  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  the  statement  in  \nVillafaña’s  2018  email  that  Menchel  had  extended  a  two-year  plea  deal  as  a  favor  to  one  of  \nEpstein’s attorneys.  \nE. The  Evidence  Does  Not  Establish  That  the  Subjects’  Meetings  with  Defense  \nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein \n OPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with \ndefense  counsel  while  possible  charges  were  under  consideration  or  during  the  period  after  the  \nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism \ntoward or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.   \n1. The  Evidence  Shows  That  the  Subjects’  Decisions  to  Meet  with  \nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations  \nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving \nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent \nin sex offense cases.  As the lead prosecutor, Villafaña vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s \nattorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them.  In Villafaña’s \nview,  the  significance  of  the  early  meetings  granted  to  the  defense  team  was  that,  but  for  those  \nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 31, 2007 “term \nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”   \nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense attorneys persistently contacted the \nsubjects  through  emails,  correspondence,  and  phone  calls,  relatively  few  in-person  meetings  \nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the matter.  As shown in the chart on the \nfollowing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed, \nthe  subject  supervisors  and  defense  counsel  had  five  substantive  meetings  about  the  case—\n\nincluding one called by the USAO to off er  the NP A term sheet resolution-and a sixth meeting \ntogether  with  the  State Atto\nrney and the lead state prosecutor  to discuss the  state plea. Acosta \nattended  only  one pre-NP A meetin\ng. After the  NP A was signed and before Epstein entered his \nstate guilty pleas, the subject supervisors and the defense team had one substantive meeting, one \nunscheduled meeting on a  proced\nural  matter,  and a  meeting with one defense attorney in \npreparation for a conference call; in addition, Acosta had the breakfast meeti\nng with Lefkowitz. \n229 \nDate USAO Participants Defense Topic/Purpose \nParticipants \nPre\n-NPA \nFeb. 1, 2007 Lourie / Villafana \nLefco\nmt / Sanchez \nDefense presents  investigation \nimproprieties and federal \njurisdiction issues \nFeb.20, 2007 Lourie / Villafana \nLefco\nmt / Sanchez \nDefense presents witness issues \nJune 26, 2007 \nSloman / Menchel / Dershowitz / Black \nDefense presents  legal issues, \nLourie / Villafana \n/ Lefcomt / Sanchez \ninvestigation improprieties, an d \nfederal jurisdiction issues \nJuly 31, 2007 Sloman / Menchel / Black / Lefcomt / USAO presents NP A te1m sheet \nLourie / Villafana \nSanchez \nSep\nt. 7, 2007 Acosta / Oosterbaan / Stan  / Lefkowitz / \nDefense presents counteroffer \nSloman/ \nVillafana/ \nSanchez \nVillafana's co-counsel \nSep\nt. 12, 2007 \nLourie / Lourie Lefkowitz/ Lefcomt \nJoint meeting with Krischer / \nsuccessor / Villafana \n/ Goldberger \nBelohlavek re state plea \nprovision of \nNP A \nPost-NPA \nOct. 12, 2007 \nAcosta \nLefkowitz \nDefense discussion of N PA \nte1ms and likely appeal to \nDepaitment \nNov. \n21, 2007 \nSloman (possibly Lefkowitz (possibly \nDefense discussion of victims' \n( unscheduled) Acosta) \nDershowitz) atto\nrney representative \nproced\nure \nDec. \n14, 2007 \nAcosta \nI Sloman / StaiT / Weinberg / Defense presents federal \nVillafana/ another Dershowitz \nI j urisdiction issues, legal issues, \nsenior AUSA Lefco\nmt \nand request for de nova review \nJan. 7,2008 (1) Acosta \nI Sloman (1) Sanchez Defense presents USAO \n(2) Acosta/ Sloman (2) \nStan/ \nimproprieties and \"watered-\n( conference \ncall) \nLefkowitz/ Sanchez down\" resolution \n229 \nIn addition,  all of the subjects took phone calls from various defense attorneys,  and although numerous \ndocumentary re.cords refer to such calls, there may have been others for which OPR located no record. \n156 \n\n \n157 \n \nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests \nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual.  OPR questioned each of \nthe four supervisory subject attorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with \nthe defense.   \nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he \ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so.  Lourie \nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafaña—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of \n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is power,” and as long as the USAO did not share \ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all power to \nus.”    Lourie  explained  that  by  meeting  with  the  defense,  “[Y]ou’re  getting  the  information  that  \nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on.  The witnesses that they think are liars . . . .  \nAnd  so  you  can  form  all  of  that  into  your  strategy.”    Lourie  also  told  OPR  that  giving  defense  \ncounsel  the  opportunity  to  argue  the  defense  position  is  an  important  “part  of  the  process”  that  \nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allowing them to “believe that they are getting heard.”  When \nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever \ngetting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that \n[Epstein’s attorneys] got.  But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”   \nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a \ndefense attorney “an audience,” and there was no real “downside” to doing so.  Menchel added, \n“[W]hat  happens  a  lot  of  times  is  the  government  will  carve  around  those  points  that  are  being  \nraised by the defense, and it’s good to know” what the defense will be.   \nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel \nwas  unusual  or  outside  the  norm.    He  told  OPR  that  his  initial  meeting  with  the  defense  team,  \nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense \nattorneys” who requested one.  Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Attorney to meet \nwith  opposing  counsel,  particularly  as  a  case  was  coming  to  resolution.    Sloman  corroborated  \nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense attorneys, and that the \nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.”  Furthermore, \nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense \nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements \nof  the  resolution—that  is,  the  requirements  that  Epstein  be  incarcerated,  register  as  a  sexual  \noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.    \n  OPR  examined  the  circumstances  surrounding  each  subject’s  decisions  to  have  the  \nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic \npurpose.  The first meeting, on February 1, 2007, followed a phone call between Lourie and one \nof  Epstein’s  attorneys,  in  which  the  attorney  asked  for  a  chance  to  “make  a  pitch”  about  the  \nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview following that \npitch.  Villafaña objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was \nnot  being  a  “strategic  thinker,”  and  that  he  believed  the  meeting  could  lead  to  a  debriefing  of  \nEpstein.  The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follow-up \nmeeting  on  February  20,  2007,  defense  counsel  gave  the  USAO  audio  recordings  of  the  state’s  \nwitness  interviews.    Contemporaneous  documents  indicate  that  Lourie  was  unpersuaded  by  the  \ndefense  arguments.    After  Villafaña  circulated  the  prosecution  memorandum,  Lourie  suggested  \n\n \n158 \n \npreparing  a  “short”  charging  document  “with  only  ‘clean’  victims  that  they  have  not  dirtied  up  \nalready.”\n230\n  The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the \nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR \nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored \ninto the government’s charging strategy.      \n  The  two  February  2007  Villafaña/Lourie-level  meetings  focused  on  witness  issues  and  \nclaims  of  misconduct  by  state  investigators,  but  in  late  May  2007,  defense  attorneys  requested  \nanother  meeting—this  time  with  higher-level  supervisors  Menchel  and  Sloman—to  make  a  \npresentation  concerning  legal  deficiencies  in  a  potential  federal  prosecution.    The  request  was  \ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to \nus . . . to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.”  The requested meeting \ntook place on June 26, 2007.  Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafaña provided to \nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges.  Defense \ncounsel used that information to prepare a 19-page letter, submitted to the USAO the day before \nthe  June  26  meeting,  as  “an  overview”  of  the  defense  position.    In  an  email  to  his  colleagues,  \nLourie  evaluated  the  defense  submission,  noting  its  weaker  and  stronger  arguments.    A  \ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña viewed the meeting itself as \nprimarily a “listening session.”\n231\n  After the meeting, Epstein’s team submitted a second lengthy \nletter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state \nhandle the matter.   \n Menchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 31, 2007, to \nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed \nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.     \nBy  early  August,  after  the  Kirkland  &  Ellis  attorneys—Starr  and  Lefkowitz—joined  the  \ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I \nhave  not  met  with  them.”    A  meeting  with  the  defense  team  was  eventually  scheduled  for  \nSeptember 7, 2007, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, and Oosterbaan met with Starr, Lefkowitz, \nand Sanchez.  In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense, \nwith Oosterbaan participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.”  In another email to Sloman \nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhow, if we don’t meet \nwith them.  I’d rather keep it here.  Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so.  If our deadline \nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.”  Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,” \nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments.  Acosta said that he had already \ndecided how he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our \nposition.”     \n                                                 \n230\n    Lourie  also  recommended  that  the  initial  charging  document  “should  contain  only  the  victims  they  have  \nnothing on at all.”   \n231\n    During  her  OPR  interview,  the  FBI  case  agent  recalled  that  defense  counsel  asked  questions  about  the  \ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break \nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense.  She did \nnot recall specifics of the discussion, however.   \n\n \n159 \n \nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense attorneys, together with the \nState Attorney and the lead state prosecutor on September 12, 2007, was a necessary part of the \nNPA negotiation process.   \n Even after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of \nthe  case,  both  within  the  USAO  and  by  the  Department’s  Criminal  Division  and  the  Deputy  \nAttorney General.  Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one \nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December 14, 2007.\n232\n  This meeting occurred in lieu of the \nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Attorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense \nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with \nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\n233\n  \nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear \nas  if  he  “fear[ed]”  that  review.    Acosta’s  nuanced  position,  however,  was  not  clear  to  the  \nDepartment attorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor \nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it.  Notably, though, none of those meetings \nor  reviews  resulted  in  the  USAO  abandoning  the  NPA,  and  Epstein  gained  no  substantial  \nadvantage from his continued entreaties.   \nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their \npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards.  OPR cannot say that the \nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside \nthe  norm—for  a  high  profile  case  with  skilled  defense  attorneys—that  the  quantity  of  meetings  \nalone shows that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism.  In evaluating the subjects’ \nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and \nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic \ngoals.    Although  OPR  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  because  Acosta,  Menchel,  Lourie,  or  \nSloman knew or knew of the defense attorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it \nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense attorneys, including those who are known \nto  them  and  those  who  are  not.    Furthermore,  meetings  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  high  profile  \ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request \nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department.  Most significantly, OPR did not \nfind  evidence  supporting  a  conclusion  that  the  meetings  themselves  resulted  in  any  substantial  \nbenefit to the defense.  At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual, \nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the matter to the state to \nproceed  as  it  saw  fit.    The  USAO  never  yielded  on  that  point.    Accordingly,  OPR  did  not  find  \nevidence  supporting  a  conclusion  that  Acosta,  Sloman,  Menchel,  Lourie,  or  Villafaña  met  with  \ndefense  counsel  for  the  purpose  of  benefiting  Epstein  or  that  the  meetings  themselves  caused  \nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein. \n                                                 \n232\n  Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz is discussed separately in the following section. \n233\n  Starr and other defense attorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterbaan in March 2008.  Although Starr requested a meeting with \nAssistant Attorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Attorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.   \n\n \n160 \n \n2. The  Evidence  Does  Not  Establish  That  Acosta  Negotiated  a  Deal  \nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel   \n  OPR  separately  considered  the  circumstances  of  one  specific  meeting  that  has  been  the  \nsubject of media attention and public criticism.  The Miami Herald’s November 2018 reporting on \nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting that \ndefense  counsel  Jay  Lefkowitz  arranged  to  have  with  Acosta  at  the  West  Palm  Beach  Marriott  \nhotel.  According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allow Epstein \nto  serve  “just  13  months”  in  the  county  jail  in  exchange  for  the  shuttering  of  the  federal  \ninvestigation,  and  Acosta  also  agreed  to  “conceal”  the  full  extent  of  Epstein’s  crimes  from  the  \nvictims and the public.\n234\n  Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that \nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shows that Acosta \ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October 11 for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel, \nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October 12 he was to speak at \nthe  Palm  Beach  County  Bench  Bar  Conference.    After  carefully  considering  the  evidence  \nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness \naccounts,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta  did  not  negotiate  the  NPA,  or  make  any  significant  \nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.   \n Epstein and his attorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2007—more than two weeks \nbefore  the  October  12  breakfast  meeting.    The  signed  NPA  contained  all  of  the  key  provisions  \nresulting  from  the  preceding  weeks  of  negotiations  between  the  parties,  and  despite  a  later  \naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those \nkey  provisions  remained  in  place  thereafter.    Acosta  told  OPR  that  throughout  the  negotiations  \nwith  the  defense,  he  sought  three  goals:    (1)  Epstein’s  guilty  plea  in  state  court  to  an  offense  \nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism \nthrough  which  victims  could  obtain  monetary  damages  from  Epstein.    As  noted  previously,  the  \nUSAO’s  original  plea  offer  in  Menchel’s  August  3,  2007  letter  expressed  a  “non-negotiable”  \ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only \nan 18-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to 18 \nmonths  was  made  well  before  Acosta’s  breakfast  meeting  with  counsel.    The  NPA  signed  on  \nSeptember  24,  2007,  required  18  months’  incarceration,  sexual  offender  registration,  and  a  \nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these \nterms were not abandoned or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.     \n At the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, two issues involving \nthe NPA were in dispute.  Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially \nchanged the key provisions of the NPA.  First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change \nthe  mechanism  for  appointing  an  attorney  representative  for  the  victims.    This  USAO-initiated  \nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA.  Sloman sent the text of a \nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkowitz on October 11, 2007.\n235\n  Although OPR found no decisive \n                                                 \n234\n  Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the \ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018. \n235\n  In his December 19, 2007, letter to defense attorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the \naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.   \n\n \n161 \n \nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkowitz and Acosta show \nthat  it  was  under  discussion  at  the  time  they  were  scheduling  the  meeting.    Shortly  after  the  \nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkowitz (copying Acosta and Villafaña), \nnoting  that  he  “just  got  off  the  phone  with  Alex”  and  offering  a  slightly  revised  portion  of  the  \naddendum  relating  to  the  mechanism  for  selection  of  the  attorney  representative.    Sloman  later  \nclarified for Villafaña that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”     \nA  second  area  of  continuing  negotiation  arose  from  the  defense  claim  that  Epstein’s  \nobligation under the NPA to pay the attorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the \nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him.  Although this was at odds with the USAO’s \ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the \nprovision  in  the  NPA  addendum  that  was  finalized  several  weeks  after  the  October  breakfast  \nmeeting.    Although  the  revised  provision  was  to  Epstein’s  advantage,  the  revision  concerned  \nattorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein \nunder § 2255.    The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that \nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue. \n OPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta \nand  Lefkowitz.    In  a  letter  sent  to  Acosta  on  October  23,  2007,  two  weeks  after  the  breakfast  \nmeeting, Lefkowitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.  \nSpecifically,  Lefkowitz  claimed  that  Acosta  had  agreed  (1)  not  to  intervene  with  the  State  \nAttorney’s  Office’s  handling  of  the  case,  (2)  not  to  contact  any  of  the  victim-witnesses  or  their  \ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received.  Acosta told OPR that \nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense \ncounsel  attributed  to  him.    Acosta  also  told  OPR  that  Lefkowitz  was  not  a  reliable  narrator  of  \nevents,  and  on  several  occasions  in  written  communications  had  inaccurately  and  misleadingly  \ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.   \nOf  more  significance  for  OPR’s  evaluation  was  a  contemporaneous  document—an    \nOctober 25, 2007 draft response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed \nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkowitz’s claims.  The draft letter stated:  \nI  specifically  want  to  clarify  one  of  the  items  that  I  believe  was  \ninaccurate in that October 23rd letter.  Your letter claimed that this \nOffice \nwould not intervene with the State Attorney’s Office \nregarding this matter; or contact any of the identified \nindividuals,  potential  witnesses,  or  potential  civil  \nclaimants and their respective counsel in this matter; \nand   neither   your   Office   nor   the   [FBI]   would   \nintervene   regarding   the   sentence   Mr.   Epstein   \nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as \nthat sentence does not violate state law.    \nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States \nAttorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a \n\n \n162 \n \npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order.  Our Office cannot \nand will not agree to this.   \nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this matter like any other case. \nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkowitz for mischaracterizing \nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting.  Although OPR could not find evidence that the \nletter was sent to Lefkowitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly \nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkowitz’s description of their discussions and had \ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.   \n  Nevertheless,  OPR  examined  the  three  specific  concessions  that  Lefkowitz  described  in  \nthe October 23 letter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during \nthe breakfast meeting.  First, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting \nthat  he  did  not  intend  to  interfere  with  the  state’s  handling  of  the  case.    Contemporaneous  \ndocuments show that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did \nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney or the state court.  For example, during the NPA \nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafaña to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State \nAttorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his \nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date.  Although Acosta may have \nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the \nstate’s  proceedings,  such  a  statement  would  have  been  a  reiteration  of  his  prior  position  on  the  \nsubject, rather than any new concession.   \n Lefkowitz also claimed in his October 23, 2007 letter that Acosta agreed not to contact any \nof  the  victims  or  potential  witnesses  or  their  counsel.    For  the  reasons  discussed  more  fully  in  \nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not \nstem  from  the  breakfast  meeting,  but  rather  reflected  an  assessment  of  multiple  issues  and  \nconsiderations  discussed  internally  by  the  subjects  who  participated  in  that  decision:  Acosta,  \nSloman, and Villafaña.   \n Finally, Lefkowitz’s October 23 letter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene \nregarding  the  sentence  Epstein  received  from  the  state  court,  and  it  asserted  that  Epstein  was  \n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work \nrelease.”  Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, however, show clearly \nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision.  The NPA required Epstein \nto make a joint recommendation with the State Attorney’s Office for an 18-month jail sentence, \nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to \nall  state  inmates.    After  the  October  breakfast  meeting,  Sloman  and  Villafaña,  on  behalf  of  the  \nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also \nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release.  For example, in a November 5, \n2007 letter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by \nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that \nthe Court impose a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.”  Shortly \nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2008, Villafaña wrote to the State Attorney to remind him \nthat  the  NPA  required  Epstein  to  plead  in  state  court  to  an  offense  that  required  an  18-month  \n\n \n163 \n \nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement \na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”   \n The guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2008 was consistent with the dictates \nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months’ incarceration.  \nEpstein, however, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to \nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail.  The NPA did not reference work \nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County \nStockade.  Moreover, Villafaña received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve \nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.”  Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein \nwork  release  privileges  during  his  incarceration  rested  with  state  officials,  who  had  the  sole  \nauthority for administering the work release program.  \nAfter  considering  the  substantial  record  documenting  the  decisions  made  after  Acosta’s  \nOctober 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest \nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served \npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work \nrelease.   \nF. Villafaña’s   Emails   with   Defense   Attorney   Lefkowitz   during   the   NPA   \nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaña, or Other Subjects, Intended to \nGive  Epstein  Preferential  Treatment  or  Were  Motivated  by  Favoritism  or  \nOther Improper Influences  \n  During  the  CVRA  litigation,  the  petitioners  obtained  from  Epstein’s  attorney,  and  filed  \nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña \n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, \nand  thereafter.    These  emails  had  been  redacted  to  delete  most  of  Lefkowitz’s  side  of  the  \ncommunications,   and   consequently   they   did   not   reflect   the   full   context   of   Villafaña’s   \ncommunications  to  Lefkowitz.    The  redacted  emails  were  later  unsealed  and  made  public  over  \nEpstein’s objections.\n236\n  Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña’s emails as \nproof  that  Villafaña  and  the  USAO  worked  in  concert  with  Epstein’s  attorneys  to  keep  the  \n“sweetheart”  deal  a  secret  from  the  victims  and  the  public.    Statements  in  several  emails  in  \nparticular  were  cited  as  evidence  of  the  USAO’s  improper  favoritism  towards  Epstein.    In  one  \nexample, Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing \nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and \nall of the other persons that we could charge.”  She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’” \nto  finalize  negotiations.    She  also  proposed,  “[o]n  an  ‘avoid  the  press’  note,”  that  filing  federal  \ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press \ncoverage.   \n                                                 \n236\n  The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal \nprotected information.  United States’ Response to Petitioners’ Motion to Use Correspondence to Prove Violations of \nthe  [CVRA]  and  to  Have  Their  Unredacted  Pleadings  Unsealed  (Apr.  7,  2011).    The  court  declined  to  order  the  \nadditional redactions.   \n\n \n164 \n \n  OPR  asked  Villafaña  about  these  emails  and  about  the  tenor  of  her  interactions  with  \nLefkowitz  during  the  NPA  negotiations  and  with  other  defense  attorneys  generally.    Villafaña  \nacknowledged  that  their  tone  was  collegial  and  collaborative,  and  explained  that  generally,  the  \ntone  of  these  emails  reflected  her  personality  and  her  commitment  to  complete  the  task  her  \nsupervisors had assigned to her:  \n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find \nthat that is how I communicate with people.  I’m a Minnesota girl, \nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be.  And I can \nbe when I need to be.  But my instructions from my supervisors were \nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them.  So I felt that \ngiven  that  task,  the  best  way  to  complete  them  was  to  reach  the  \nagreement  and,  keeping  in  mind  the  terms  that  .  .  .  our  office  had  \nagreed  to,  and  do  that  in  a  way  that  is  civil.    So  .  .  .  although  my  \nlanguage  in  the  kind  of  introductory  or  prefatory  communications  \nwith Mr. Lefkowitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at \nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes, \nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”  \n Villafaña denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide \nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question.  The email \nin which Villafaña expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all \nof the other persons that we could charge” was written in response to a defense proposal to include \nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not \nto  prosecute  Epstein’s  assistants  and  other  employees.    Lefkowitz  had  proposed  that  the  plea  \nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the \ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against \n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate entity] for \nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR that \nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who \ncould  be  charged,  and  thus  did  not  oppose  the  request  not  to  prosecute  third  parties.    However,  \nVillafaña was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to \nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might \nlead  Epstein  to  claim  the  government  breached  the  agreement  by  providing  information  to  the  \ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty.  Villafaña was not the \nonly one to express concern about how deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether \nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement.  In an earlier email, Lourie \nhad  suggested  charging  Epstein  by  complaint  to  allow  the  USAO  more  flexibility  in  plea  \nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that \nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.    \nAs to Villafaña’s offer to meet with Lefkowitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues \nin  the  NPA  negotiation,  she  explained  to  OPR  that  she  believed  a  face-to-face  meeting  at  a  \n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate \ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time. \n\n \n165 \n \n With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafaña told OPR that her goal \nwas  to  protect  the  anonymity  of  the  victims.    She  said  that  the  case  was  far  more  likely  to  be  \ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already written articles about Epstein, than in Miami, \nand “if [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the \ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.” \n In evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafaña, as well \nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkowitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted \nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did \nnot  locate  in  the  USAO  records).    OPR  also  considered  the  emails  in  the  broader  context  of  \nVillafaña’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein.  The documentary record, \nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafaña consistently advocated in favor \nof  prosecuting  Epstein  and  worked  for  months  toward  that  goal.    She  repeatedly  pressed  her  \nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the \ncase.  She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because \nher supervisors agreed to those meetings.  Villafaña objected to the decision to resolve the case \nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with \nMenchel about that subject.  When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect \nthat resolution, Villafaña fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position \ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.     \nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense \ncounsel.    Sloman,  in  particular,  told  OPR  that  reports  that  Villafaña  “was  soft  on  Epstein  .  .  .  \ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.”  Sloman added that Villafaña “did her best to implement \nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.”  Lourie similarly told OPR that \nwhen  he  read  the  district  court’s  February  2019  opinion  in  the  CVRA  litigation  and  the  emails  \nfrom Villafaña cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see how nice she was to them.  And she \nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them.  When I know the whole time she was the \none who wanted to go after him the most.”  The AUSA who assisted Villafaña on the investigation \ntold  OPR  “everything  that  [Villafaña]  did  .  .  .  was,  as  far  as  I  could  tell,  [  ]  completely  pro  \nprosecution.” \n Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other \ninformation  showing  Villafaña’s  consistent  efforts  to  prosecute  Epstein  and  to  assist  victims,  a  \npublic narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the \nexpense of the victims.  After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that \nnarrative  to  be  inaccurate.    The  USAO’s  and  Villafaña’s  interactions  with  the  victims  can  be  \ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps \nVillafaña may have made in her interactions with victims or their attorneys were not made for the \npurpose of silencing victims.  Rather, the evidence shows that Villafaña, in particular, cared deeply \nabout Epstein’s victims.  Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of \nconsulting  with  victims,  and  after  the  NPA  was  signed,  she  drafted  letters  to  notify  victims  \nidentified  in  the  federal  investigation  of  the  pending  state  plea  proceeding  and  inviting  them  to  \nappear.  The draft letters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafaña \nand Sloman committed professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and \nunusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” of the listed victims.  Given the full context of Villafaña’s \nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are \n\n \n166 \n \nentitled  to  significant  weight,  and  OPR  credits  them.    OPR  finds,  therefore,  that  the  emails  in  \nquestion  do  not  themselves  establish  that  Villafaña  (or  any  other  subject)  acted  to  improperly  \nbenefit  Epstein,  was  motivated  by  favoritism  or  other  improper  influences,  or  sought  to  silence  \nvictims.  \nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña Agreed to \nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators” \nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential \nAssociates  \n OPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafaña, Lourie, \nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute \n“any  potential  co-conspirators  of  Epstein,”  in  addition  to  four  named  individuals,  to  determine  \nwhether  that  provision  resulted  from  the  subjects’  improper  favoritism  towards  Epstein  or  an  \nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s known associates.  Other than various \ndrafts  of  the  NPA  and  of  a  federal  plea  agreement,  OPR  found  little  in  the  contemporaneous  \nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration.  Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement show \nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” \nevolved from a more narrow provision sought by the defense.  The provision expanded as Villafaña \nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the \nNPA,  with  apparently  little  analysis  and  no  substantive  discussion  within  the  USAO  about  the  \nprovision.\n237\n   \n \n  As  the  NPA  drafting  process  concluded,  Villafaña  circulated  to  Lourie  and  another  \nsupervisor  a  draft  that  contained  the  non-prosecution  provision,  telling  Lourie  it  was  “some  of  \n[defense  counsel’s]  requested  language  regarding  promises  not  to  prosecute  other  people,”  and  \ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.”  In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue \n                                                 \n237\n  As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense \nsought  a  non-prosecution  provision  applicable  to  only  four  female  named  assistants  of  Epstein  and  to  unnamed  \nemployees  of  one  of  his  companies.    Villafaña  initially  countered  with  “standard  language”  referring  to  unnamed  \n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that \nwe  could  charge.”    Nonetheless,  drafts  of  the  NPA  sent  by  Lefkowitz  after  Villafaña’s  email  continued  to  include  \nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees.  Villafaña, however, internally circulated \ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability \nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal conduct by \nthose persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.”  The federal plea agreement draft revised \nby Lourie and Acosta on September 20, 2007, included that language.  When the defense team reverted to negotiation \nof state charges, Villafaña advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more \nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.”  The next day, Lefkowitz sent a revised draft NPA \nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for \nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.”  The language was finally revised by Villafaña \nto  prohibit  prosecution  of  “any  potential  co-conspirators  of  Epstein,  including  but  not  limited  to  [the  four  named  \nassistants].”   \n In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution \nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges \nand a time-limited scope of conduct.  Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain \nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.   \n\n \n167 \n \nVillafaña  had  raised  (defense  counsel’s  attempt  to  insert  an  immigration  waiver  into  the  \nagreement),  but  Lourie  did  not  comment  on  the  provision  promising  not  to  prosecute  co-\nconspirators  or  ask  Villafaña  to  explain  why  she  believed  the  provision  did  not  harm  the  \ngovernment’s  interests.    In  a  subsequent  email  about  the  draft  NPA,  Villafaña  asked  Lourie  for  \n“[a]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input.  OPR found no \ndocument  that  suggested  Villafaña  and  Lourie  discussed  the  provision  further,  or  that  the  other  \nindividuals  who  were  copied  on  Villafaña’s  email  referencing  the  provision—her  immediate  \nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office, \nand Villafaña’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it.  Villafaña told \nOPR  that  because  none  of  the  three  supervisors  responded  to  her  observation  that  the  non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafaña assumed that they agreed with her assessment. \n Villafaña told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision \nagreeing  not  to  prosecute  “any  potential  co-conspirators,”  but  she  remembered  generally  that  \ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame \nfor what happened.”  Villafaña told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct \nwas his own “dirty little secret.”  Villafaña said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2006 \narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that \nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators \nabout  sexual  activity  with  any  of  Epstein’s  well-known  contacts  about  whom  allegations  arose  \nmany years later.\n238\n  Villafaña acknowledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime \nrelationship  with  a  close  female  friend  who  was  a  well-known  socialite,  but,  according  to  \nVillafaña, in 2007, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”\n239\n  Accordingly, Villafaña \nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the \nfour female assistants identified by name.\n240\n  Villafaña also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s \ninvestigation  was  Epstein,  and  the  office  was  not  inclined  to  prosecute  his  four  assistants  if  he  \nentered a plea.\n241\n  Because Villafaña was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged, \nshe  perceived  no  reason  to  object  to  a  provision  promising  not  to  prosecute  other,  unspecified  \n“co-conspirators.”  Villafaña told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did \nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any \nof Epstein’s influential associates.   \n  Lourie,  who  was  transitioning  to  his  detail  at  the  Department’s  Criminal  Division  at  the  \ntime Villafaña forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR \nthat  he  did  not  know  how  the  provision  developed  and  did  not  recall  any  discussions  about  it.    \n                                                 \n238\n  Villafaña told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being \ninvolved in abusing them.  It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”   \n239\n  The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct \ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.   \n240\n  The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one \ngirl  in  Epstein’s  presence;  this  assistant  was  one  of  the  named  individuals  for  whom  the  defense  sought  the  \ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset.  Villafaña explained to OPR that this individual was herself \nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim. \n241\n  Villafaña told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.  \n\n \n168 \n \nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told \nOPR that he did not know why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike \nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehow helpful.”  Lourie \nposited  that  victims  who  recruited  other  underage  girls  to  provide  massages  for  Epstein  \n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators.  He told OPR that when he saw the \nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to \nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”  \n  Acosta  did  not  recall  any  discussions  about  the  non-prosecution  provision.    But  he  told  \nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed \nthe  federal  interests  as  vindicated  as  long  as  Epstein  was  required  to  face  “meaningful  \nconsequences” for his actions.  Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the \nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been \nthe focus is on Epstein[ ] . . . going to jail.  Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, \nlesser  involved  [individuals],  is  not  the  focus  of  this.”    Acosta  also  told  OPR  that  he  assumed  \nVillafaña and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate.  Finally, \nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood \nthe  non-prosecution  provision  was  designed  to  protect  Epstein’s  four  assistants,  and  it  “never  \ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else. \n  This  broad  provision  promising  not  to  prosecute  “any  potential  co-conspirators”  is  \ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence showing that \nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was \nwarranted  given  that  the  investigation  had  been  curtailed  and  the  USAO  lacked  complete  \ninformation  regarding  possible  co-conspirators.    Villafaña  precipitously  revised  a  more  narrow  \nprovision sought by the defense.  Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it \nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the \ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose.  However, the USAO had not indicated interest \nin  prosecuting  anyone  other  than  the  four  named  female  assistants,  and  OPR  found  no  record  \nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the \nfour  assistants  and  unnamed  employees  of  a  specific  Epstein  company.    Accordingly,  OPR  \nconcludes  that  the  evidence  does  not  show  that  Acosta,  Lourie,  or  Villafaña  agreed  to  the  non-\nprosecution  provision  to  protect  any  of  Epstein’s  political,  celebrity,  or  other  influential  \nassociates.\n242\n        \nH. OPR’s  Investigation  Did  Not  Reveal  Evidence  Establishing  That  Epstein  \nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on \nThat Basis \n One final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may \nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal \n                                                 \n242\n  As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafaña included the provision in draft plea agreements \nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.  \nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007, before the parties drafted the NPA. \n\n \n169 \n \ninvestigation.\n243\n    Media  reports  in  mid-2009  suggested  Epstein  was  released  from  his  state  \nincarceration  “early”  because  he  was  assisting  in  a  financial  crimes  investigation  in  the  Eastern  \nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns.  At the time, Villafaña \nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the matter that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was \nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government.  In 2011, Villafaña reported to senior \ncolleagues that “this is urban myth.  The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of \nit is true.”  Villafaña told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New \nYork was “completely false.”  Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein \ncooperating  in  a  financial  investigation  or  relating  to  media  reports  that  Epstein  had  been  an  \n“intelligence asset.”\n244\n   \nIn  addition  to  the  contemporaneous  record  attesting  that  Epstein  was  not  a  cooperating  \nwitness in a federal matter, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating \nwitness  or  “intelligence  asset,”  or  that  anyone—including  any  of  the  subjects  of  OPR’s  \ninvestigation—believed  that  to  be  the  case,  or  that  Epstein  was  afforded  any  benefit  on  such  a  \nbasis.  OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion \nthat he had assisted in a different matter, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense \ncounsel to the USAO and the Department.  It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have \nomitted any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.   \nAccordingly,  OPR  concludes  that  none  of  the  subjects  of  OPR’s  investigation  provided  \nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal \ninvestigation,  and  OPR  found  no  evidence  establishing  that  Epstein  had  received  benefits  for  \ncooperation in any matter. \nV.  ACOSTA  EXERCISED  POOR  JUDGMENT  BY  RESOLVING  THE  FEDERAL  \nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA \n Although OPR finds that none of the subjects committed professional misconduct in this \nmatter,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta  exercised  poor  judgment  when  he  agreed  to  end  the  federal  \ninvestigation through the NPA.  Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case \nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the \nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to \nmanipulate  the  conditions  of  his  sentence  to  his  own  advantage.    The  NPA  relied  on  state  \nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over \nthe process.  Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA, \nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release \nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision.  Important provisions, such as promising \nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with little discussion or consideration \nby  the  prosecutors.    In  addition,  although  there  were  evidentiary  and  legal  challenges  to  a  \n                                                 \n243\n  See,  e.g.,  Julie  K.  Brown,  “Perversion  of  Justice:  How  a  future  Trump  Cabinet  member  gave  a  serial  sex  \nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.      \n244\n  When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2019 press conference, in answering a \nmedia question about whether he had knowledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that \n“the answer is no.”  Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified setting to discuss intelligence information. \n\n \n170 \n \nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately \naddressing  ways  in  which  a  federal  case  potentially  could  have  been  strengthened,  such  as  by  \nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment.  Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO \ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of \ndrafting  the  NPA,  a  unique  document  that  required  more  detailed  attention  and  review  than  it  \nreceived.    These  problems  were,  moreover,  entirely  avoidable  because  federal  prosecution,  and  \npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.   \nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that \nsome of Epstein’s conduct known today was not known in 2007 and that other circumstances have \nchanged  in  the  interim,  including  some  victims’  willingness  to  testify.    OPR  has  also  evaluated  \nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allows for decisions that are made in good \nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could \nhave been obtained.  Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality \nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he \nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would \nreasonably expect of an attorney exercising good judgment.  \nA. Acosta’s  Decision  to  Resolve  the  Federal  Investigation  through  a  State  Plea  \nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application \nof  the  Petite  Policy  and  Federalism  Concerns,  and  Failed  to  Consider  the  \nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution  \n  The  Department  formulated  the  Petite policy  in  response  to  a  series  of  Supreme  Court  \nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the power to \nprosecute for the same act.  Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in \na rule permitting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining \nto bring a federal prosecution following a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except \nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest.  See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. \nat  28.    On  its  face,  the  Petite  policy  applies  to  federal  prosecutions  that  follow  completed  state  \nprosecutions.  USAM § 9-2.031 (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state . . . \nprosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, \nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”).  When \na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply.  Indeed, even when \na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal \nprosecution  when  three  substantive  prerequisites  are  satisfied:    a  “substantial  federal  interest”  \nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal \ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction \non federal charges.  The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a \nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”  \n  No  one  with  whom  OPR  spoke  disputed  that  the  federal  government  had  a  substantial  \ninterest in prosecuting Epstein.  In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña identified five federal \nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated.  The CEOS Chief described Villafaña’s assessment \nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the \nfacts of the case.  Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel, \nand  the  use  of  a  facility  of  interstate  commerce,  all  of  which  were  areas  of  federal  concern.    \n\n \n171 \n \nNotably, in the early 2000s, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child \nsex  trafficking,  including  Project  Safe  Childhood,  and  Congress  had  then  recently  passed  the  \nPROTECT Act.  Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal \ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and \nthe number of victims.   \n  It  is  also  clear  that  because  the  state  case  against  Epstein  was  still  pending  and  had  not  \nreached a conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and \ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein.  He had been charged with one state \ncharge  of  solicitation  to  prostitution  on  three  occasions,  involving  one  or  more  other  persons  \nwithout  regard  to  age—a  charge  that  would  have  addressed  only  a  scant  portion  of  the  conduct  \nunder federal investigation.  Acosta acknowledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did \nnot apply.  Moreover, the State Attorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption \nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding \nwith  the  state  prosecution  in  deference  to  the  federal  government’s  involvement.    In  these  \ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication \nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.  \nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual \nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had \nresidences outside of Florida.  Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has little doubt that the \nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under \nthe circumstances of this case.\n245\n   \n Despite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy \ndid  not  apply,  and  the  State  Attorney’s  willingness  to  hold  the  state  prosecution  in  abeyance  \npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s \nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.\n246\n  In essence, Acosta believed \nthat  a  federal  prosecution  would  have  interfered  improperly  with  the  state’s  authority.    He  \nexplained his reasoning to OPR: \n                                                 \n245\n    In  2008,  the  Office  of  Enforcement  Operations,  the  office  charged  with  reviewing  Petite  policy  waiver  \nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would \nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim.  The office also noted that if other factors \nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.  \n246\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s \nconcerns from those of the other subjects.  However, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his \nsubordinates’  concerns  about  the  strength  of  the  case,  victim-witness  credibility,  and  the  novelty  of  some  legal  \ntheories,  he  alone  focused  on  federalism  issues.    Acosta’s  counsel  also  asserted  that  OPR  “misunderstands  and  \ndevalues  Secretary  Acosta’s  very  real  and  legitimate  interest  in  the  development  of  human  trafficking  laws,”  and  \ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal \nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater \nharm  to  trafficking  victims.”    Although  OPR  carefully  considered  counsel’s  arguments  and  agrees  that  it  was  \nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the matter through the NPA, which, \nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and allowed Epstein to manipulate the \nstate system to his benefit.     \n\n \n172 \n \n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so \nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign . . . \nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind . . . the \nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state . . . \nis  an  independent  entity,  and  that  we  should  presume  that  what  \nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except \nin the most unusual of circumstances. \nAcosta  told  OPR  that  “absent  USAO  intervention,”  the  state’s  prosecution  of  Epstein  \nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis.  In \nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”\n247\n  Acosta told OPR \nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s attention if the State \nAttorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration.  Acosta therefore decided that \nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein \nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.   \n Acosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted.  Acosta’s repeated references to a \n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used \nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with \na criminal case after a completed state prosecution.  Nothing in the Petite policy, however, requires \nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state \nprosecution,  even  if  the  state  is  already  investigating  the  same  offense.    The  goal  of  the  Petite  \npolicy  is  to  prevent  multiple  prosecutions  for  the  same  offense,  not  to  compel  the  federal  \ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials \ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions \nregarding  the  state  prosecutor’s  commitment  to  the  case.    Acosta  told  OPR  that  “there  are  any  \nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state \ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and \nlets the state proceed.”  The fact that the federal government can allow the state to proceed with a \nprosecution, however, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in \na matter in which a distinct and important federal interest exists.  Indeed, the State Attorney told \nOPR  that  the  federal  government  regularly  takes  over  cases  initiated  by  state  investigators,  \ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”    \n  Epstein  was  facing  a  substantial  sentence  under  the  federal  sentencing  guidelines.\n248\n  \nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily \nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a little bit more” does not approach \nthat standard.  In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent \nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,” \nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from \nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to \n                                                 \n247\n  Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at 1 (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The \nDaily Beast. \n248\n  Villafaña estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.  \n\n \n173 \n \ndepart  from  the  Ashcroft  Memo.    He  told  OPR,  however,  that  he  did  not  recall  discussing  the  \nAshcroft  Memo  with  his  colleagues  and  nothing  in  the  contemporaneous  documentary  record  \nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal \ninvestigation through the NPA.  Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension \nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and \nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other \nhand.  OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein \ntoo narrowly and through the wrong prism. \n  Furthermore,  Acosta’s  federalism  concerns  about  intruding  on  the  state’s  autonomy  \nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision \nto  pursue  a  federal  prosecution  would  have.\n249\n    By  means  of  the  NPA,  the  federal  government  \ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had \nto obtain during the state’s own prosecution.  Acosta acknowledged during his OPR interview that \nhis “attempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being \narguably more intrusive.”     \nAcosta’s   concern   about   invading   the   state’s   authority   led   to   additional   negative   \nconsequences.  Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting \nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain \nactions to the state.  In so doing, however, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement, \nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.  \n OPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a \nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages \nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had \npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar.  Villafaña recognized that there were “a lot of ways \nto  manipulate  state  sentences,”  and  she  told  OPR  that  she  was  concerned  from  the  outset  of  \nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO \nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.”  Villafaña also told OPR that defense counsel \n“had  a  lot  of  experience  with  the  state  system.    We  did  not.”    Epstein’s  ability  to  obtain  work  \nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a \nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended \non  a  judicial  system  with  which  they  were  unfamiliar  and  over  which  they  had  no  control.    \nAlthough  the  issue  of  gain  time  was  considered  and  addressed  in  the  NPA,  none  of  the  subject  \nattorneys  negotiating  the  NPA  realized  until  after  the  NPA  was  signed  that  Epstein  might  be  \neligible for work release.  Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind \nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.”  Because work release was not \nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein \nfrom applying for admission to the program.       \n                                                 \n249\n  The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions.  It does not prevent state \nauthorities  from  pursuing  state  charges  after  a  federal  prosecution.    See,  e.g., United  States  v.  Nichols  and State  v.  \nNichols (dual prosecution for acts committed in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building).  However, in \npractice  and  to  use  their  resources  most  efficiently,  state  authorities  often  choose  not  to  pursue  state  charges  if  the  \nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.   \n\n \n174 \n \n The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of how Acosta’s decision \nto  create  an  unorthodox  mechanism  that  relied  on  state  procedures  to  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefitting Epstein.  Acosta told OPR that one of \nthe  core  aspects  of  the  NPA  was  the  requirement  that  Epstein  plead  guilty  to  a  state  charge  \nrequiring registration as a sexual offender.  He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the \nbeginning  and  from  which  he  never  wavered.    However,  the  USAO  failed  to  anticipate  certain  \nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had \na residence.  In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender \nregistration,  the  state  chose  conduct  involving  a  victim  who  was  at  least  16  at  the  time  of  her  \ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a 14-year old victim.  \nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a \nresidence, was 16; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state.  As a 2006 letter \nfrom  defense  counsel  Lefcourt  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  made  clear,  the  defense  team  had  \nthoroughly  researched  the  details  and  ramifications  of  Florida’s  sexual  offender  registration  \nrequirement;  OPR  did  not  find  evidence  indicating  similar  research  and  consideration  by  the  \nUSAO.          \n  Finally,  Acosta  was  well  aware  that  the  PBPD  brought  the  case  to  the  FBI’s  attention  \nbecause of a concern that the State Attorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense \ncounsel.  Villafaña told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with \nthem at the start of the federal investigation.  Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with \nVillafaña,  he  repeatedly  told  OPR  during  his  interview  that  he  was  aware  that  the  PBPD  was  \ndissatisfied with the State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case.  Shortly before the NPA was \nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Attorney’s Office \nwas  predisposed  to  manipulating  the  process  in  Epstein’s  favor.    Specifically,  during  the  \nSeptember 12, 2007 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with \nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation \nof  minors  to  engage  in  prostitution,  rather  than  the  three  charges  the  USAO  had  originally  \nspecified.  The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to \nregister as a sexual offender.  Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite \nthe  assurances  made  to  Lourie,  the  state  prosecutor  had  advised  Epstein—incorrectly,  it  turned  \nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.  \nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been \nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about \nproceeding  with  a  process  that  depended  completely  on  state  authorities  for  its  successful  \nexecution.     \n OPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by \nthis case.  He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman \nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for \ntheir  assessment  of  trial  issues.    Acosta  was  copied  on  many  substantive  emails,  reviewed  and  \nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement.  Yet, rather than focusing on whether \nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta \nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in \npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of \n\n \n175 \n \nEpstein’s state guilty plea.\n250\n  As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in \nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to \ndo so reflected poor judgment.  Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive, \nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrow, and his understanding of \nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.\n251\n   \nB. The  Assessment  of  the  Merits  of  a  Potential  Federal  Prosecution  Was  \nUndermined  by  the  Failure  to  Obtain  Evidence  or  Take  Other  Investigative  \nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case \nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also \ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing \nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant \nleverage  in  negotiating  with  Epstein.    Acosta  told  OPR  that  his  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation  through  the  NPA  was,  in  part,  due  to  concerns  about  the  merits  of  the  case  and  \nconcerns  about  whether  the  government  could  win  at  trial.    Yet,  Acosta  made  the  decision  to  \nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense \nattorneys  before  the  investigation  was  completed.    As  the  investigation  progressed,  the  FBI  \ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time \nof the initial offer.  In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not know the \nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences, \nhis  criminal  conduct  had  occurred  in  other  locations;  or  whether  the  additional  victims  might  \nimplicate  other  offenders.    In  addition,  Villafaña  planned  to  approach  the  female  assistants  to  \nattempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.\n252\n   Most importantly, Acosta ended \nthe  investigation  without  the  USAO  having  obtained  an  important  category  of  potentially  \nsignificant evidence:  the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution \nof a search warrant.  \n The PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home, \nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state \n                                                 \n250\n  Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state, \nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to \nthe FBI.  OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence.  OPR’s investigation confirmed, however, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD \nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the matter. \n251\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion \nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Attorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or \na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.”  Acosta also acknowledged that the USAO’s handling of the matter \n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and attention.  No one foresaw the additional challenges that the \nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel \ntoo much wiggle-room.”  Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not \nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”  \n252\n  Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafaña identified three of his female \nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no \nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein.  The FBI attempted unsuccessfully to make \ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2007, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands, \nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.             \n\n \n176 \n \nsearch  warrant  was  executed  on  that  property,  the  computer  equipment  associated  with  those  \ncameras  had  been  removed.    Villafaña  knew  who  had  possession  of  the  computer  equipment.    \nSurveillance  images  might  have  shown  the  victims’  visits,  and  photographic  evidence  of  their  \nappearance  at  the  time  of  their  encounters  with  Epstein  could  have  countered  the  anticipated  \nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors.  The surveillance video might have \nshown additional victims the investigators had not yet identified.  Such images could have been \npowerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their \nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation” \ncase.   \nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence.  Villafaña \ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence \nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed \nher  in  the  nude.    Based  on  this  evidence,  and  experience  in  other  sex  cases  involving  minors,  \nVillafaña  and  several  other  witnesses  opined  to  OPR  that  the  computers  might  have  contained  \nchild pornography.  Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume \nthat he may have transmitted still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet \nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling.  The interstate transmission of \nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire \ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.\n253\n  Villafaña told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what \nwe  suspected  it  was  .  .  .  [i]t  would  have  put  this  case  completely  to  bed.    It  also  would  have  \ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”   \n Because she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafaña attempted to \nobtain the missing computers.  After Villafaña learned that an individual associated with one of \nEpstein’s attorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s \nhome, she consulted with Department subject matter experts to determine how best to obtain the \nevidence.  Following the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafaña took \nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.   \n  Epstein’s  team  sought  to  postpone  compliance  with  the  USAO’s  demand  for  the  \nequipment.  In late June 2007, defense attorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply; \nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafaña stressed that “we want to get \nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant \nas soon as possible.”  She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one \nweek  until  July  17,  2007.    On  that  day,  Epstein  initiated  litigation  regarding  the  computer  \nequipment.  That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve \n                                                 \n253\n  18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) provides, in pertinent part: \nAny person who . . . induces . . . any minor to engage in . . . any sexually explicit \nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall \nbe  punished  .  .  .  if  such  person  knows  or  has  reason  to  know  that  such  visual  \ndepiction  will  be  .  .  .  transmitted  using  any  means  or  facility  of  interstate  .  .  .  \ncommerce or in or affecting interstate . . . commerce . . . [or] if that visual depiction \nwas produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or \ntransported in or affecting interstate or . . . commerce by any means, including by \ncomputer.   \n\n \n177 \n \nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year \nsentence.  The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which \nthe  FBI  was  present,  the  co-case  agent  specifically  suggested  that  the  USAO  wait  to  pursue  a  \nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug” \nwithout comment.  Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent \nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending. \n Even after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafaña \ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of \nthe  computer  equipment.    On  August  10,  2007,  she  asked  Lourie  for  authorization  to  oppose  \nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the \ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein \nat age 14 and had been photographed in the nude.  A few days later, Villafaña told defense counsel \nthat  she  had  “conferred  with  the  appropriate  people,  and  we  are  not  willing  to  agree  to  a  stay.”    \nDefense  counsel  then  contacted  Lourie,  who  agreed  to  postpone  the  hearing  until  after  the  \nupcoming meeting with Acosta.  After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the \nhearing,  Villafaña  emailed  Sloman  to  ask  if  she  should  “put  it  off”;  he  replied,  “Yes,”  and  the  \nhearing  was  re-set  for  September  18,  2007.    As  negotiations  towards  the  NPA  progressed,  \nhowever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely.  Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest \nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached \nthe agreement.   \n Villafaña told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense \nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers.  She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact \nthat  the  defense  was  trying  desperately  to  put  off  the  hearing  .  .  .  was  further  evidence  of  the  \nimportance of the evidence.”    \nOPR  questioned  Acosta  about  the  decisions  to  initiate,  and  continue  with,  the  NPA  \nnegotiations  while  the  litigation  concerning  the  computers  was  still  pending,  and  to  agree  to  \npostpone  the  litigation  rather  than  exhausting  all  efforts  to  obtain  and  review  the  computer  \nevidence.  Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain the missing \ncomputers,  but  he  believed  that  “there  was  a  desire  to  move  quickly  as  opposed  to  slowly”  \nregarding the plea.     \n  Menchel,  Sloman,  and  Lourie  also  all  told  OPR  that  they  did  not  remember  Villafaña’s  \nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.”  Menchel expressed surprise \nto  OPR  that  a  prosecutor  could  obtain  “an  entire  computer”  through  the  method  utilized  by  \nVillafaña, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.”  However, the contemporaneous records show \nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2007 of Villafaña’s efforts to obtain \nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.   \n Villafaña kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer \nequipment.  She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the \ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May 18, 2007, July 3, 2007, and July 16, 2007, \nall discussed her proposed steps.  Villafaña told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions \nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.  Lourie also received Villafaña’s July 16, 2007 email \ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly \n\n \n178 \n \nwith one of Epstein’s defense attorneys about it.  Sloman told OPR during his interview that he \n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue.  The documentary evidence confirms that he had at \nleast some contemporaneous knowledge of the issue—when asked by Villafaña whether to put off \na September 12, 2007 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so.  Finally, as noted previously, \nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the \nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.     \n Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed \nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed, \nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment.  The NPA \nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process] \nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain \n[legal  process],”  and,  further,  that  the  parties  would  “maintain  .  .  .  evidence  subject  to  [legal  \nprocess]  that  have  been  issued,  and  including  certain  computer  equipment,  inviolate”  until  the  \nNPA’s  terms  had  been  fully  satisfied,  at  which  point  the  legal  process  would  be  “deemed  \nwithdrawn.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he \ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without \nunderstanding  what  legal  process  his  office  was  agreeing  to  withdraw,  or  why  the  only  type  of  \nevidence  specified  was  “certain  computer  equipment.”    In  addition,  Acosta  told  OPR  that  he  \nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about \nthe case.  Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the \nevidentiary  issues  presented  by  a  federal  criminal  trial.    Therefore,  although  it  is  possible  that  \nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the \ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was \non  notice  of  the  existence  of  and  the  ongoing  litigation  concerning  Epstein’s  missing  computer  \nequipment.    \n Villafaña knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment \nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and \npotentially  critical—information;  and  it  was  clear  Epstein  did  not  want  the  contents  of  his  \ncomputers  disclosed.    Nothing  in  the  available  record  reveals  that  the  USAO  benefitted  from  \nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration \nof  the  costs  and  benefits  of  forgoing  the  litigation  to  obtain  production  of  the  computers.\n254\n  \nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that \ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state \nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges.  By agreeing to postpone the litigation, \nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much \nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government.  The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in \nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant \ncrimes and did so with apparently little serious consideration of the potential cost.    \n                                                 \n254\n  If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as \nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable.  Lourie suggested in his response to his interview \ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers.  However, OPR saw no evidence indicating \nthat  Villafaña  or  her  supervisors  were  concerned  that  the  court  would  do  so,  and  Villafaña  had  consulted  with  the  \nDepartment’s subject matter experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment. \n\n \n179 \n \nTo  be  clear,  OPR  is  not  suggesting  that  prosecutors  must  obtain  all  available  evidence  \nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a \nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues.  Every case is different \nand must be judged on its own facts.  In this case, however, given the unorthodox nature of the \nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different \ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of \nEpstein’s  criminal  conduct,  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  removal  of  the  computers  from  \nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal \nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences \nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flowing \nfrom the express terms of the NPA.  In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight \nof  the  bigger  picture  that  the  investigation  was  not  completed  and  viable  leads  remained  to  be  \npursued.  The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to \npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of \nall  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  proposed  action.    OPR  did  not  find  evidence  that  Acosta  fully  \nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.\n255\n    \nC. OPR   Was   Unable   to   Determine   the   Basis   for   the   Two-Year   Term   of   \nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It \nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution  \nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency \nafforded  him  concerning  his  sentence.    After  offering  a  deal  that  required  a  “non-negotiable”  \n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an 18-month term of incarceration, \nknowing  that  gain  time  would  reduce  it  further,  and  indeed,  Epstein  served  only  13  months.    \nEpstein  ultimately  did  not  serve  even  that  minimal  sentence  incarcerated  on  a  full-time  basis  \nbecause the state allowed Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his \nsentence.    As  Lourie  told  OPR,  “[E]verything  else  that  happened  to  [Epstein]  is  exactly  what  \nshould  have  happened  to  him.  .  .  .  He  had  to  pay  a  lot  of  money.    He  had  to  register  as  a  sex  \noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”   \n Due to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant \nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of how the original two-year sentence \nrequirement was developed or by whom.  Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject \ninterviews:  (1) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled \nguilty  to  an  unspecified  charge  originally  contemplated  by  the  state;  or  (2)  the  two  years  \nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding \nthe need for a trial.  As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of \nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”  He elaborated, \n                                                 \n255\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or \nshould have known about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration \nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed.  Acosta’s attorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in \nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that \nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him.  For the reasons stated above, OPR \nnonetheless  concludes  that  having  developed  a  unique  resolution  to  a  federal  investigation,  Acosta  had  a  greater  \nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.    \n\n \n180 \n \n“I’m reconstructing memories of . . . 12 years ago.  I can speculate that at some point, the matter \ncame up, and I or someone else said . . . what would the original charges have likely brought?  And \nsomeone said this amount.”  Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this \nmethod,  but  he  believed  that  it  likely  did  not  result  from  a  single  specific  discussion  but  rather  \nfrom conversations over a course of time.  Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had \nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman.  Villafaña was \nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it \nwas made.  Villafaña told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a \nstate  charge  would  have  resulted  in  a  24-month  sentence.    OPR  also  examined  applicable  state  \nstatutes  and  the  Florida  sentencing  guidelines,  but  could  not  confirm  that  Epstein  was,  in  fact,  \nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD. \n    On  the  other  hand,  during  his  OPR  interview,  Lourie  “guess[ed]”  that  “somehow  the  \ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.”  Menchel similarly told \nOPR that he did not know how the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number \nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it.  Sloman told OPR that he \nhad no idea how the two-year sentence proposal was reached.   \nThe contemporaneous documentary record, however, provides no indication that Epstein’s \nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made \nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration.  As late as July 25, 2007—\nonly  days  before  the  USAO  provided  the  term  sheet  to  defense  counsel—Epstein’s  counsel  \nsubmitted a letter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein \nat  all.    Furthermore,  after  the  initial  “term  sheet”  was  presented  and  negotiations  for  the  NPA  \nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.   \n The USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it.  The most obvious \nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that \ncarried a harsher sentence.  If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under \nthe federal sentencing guidelines, 168 to 210 months’ imprisonment.  However, it is unlikely that \nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the lower end of \nthe  guidelines.    Menchel  told  OPR  that  he  and  his  colleagues  had  been  concerned  that  Epstein  \nwould  opt  to  go  to  trial  if  charged  and  presented  with  the  option  of  pleading  to  a  guidelines  \nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks attendant upon \na trial in this case.  If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed \nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c) for a stipulated sentence, \nwhich  requires  judicial  approval.    Acosta  rejected  this  idea,  however,  apparently  because  of  a  \nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule 11(c) \npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.   \nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried \na maximum five-year sentence.  Shortly after Villafaña circulated the prosecution memorandum \nto  her  supervisors,  Lourie  recommended  to  Acosta  charging  Epstein  by  criminal  complaint  and  \noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea attractive.”  Similarly, before learning that Menchel \nhad  already  discussed  a  state-based  resolution  with  Epstein’s  counsel,  Villafaña  had  considered  \noffering  Epstein  a  plea  to  one  count  of  conspiracy  and  a  substantive  charge,  to  be  served  \nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding \n\n \n181 \n \nindictment.  Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and \ndefense  counsel’s  efforts  to  minimize  the  amount  of  time  Epstein  would  spend  in  jail,  it  is  \nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even \nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.   \n Weighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution \nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a \nmechanism  for  the  victims  to  recover  damages.    These  advantages,  added  to  Acosta’s  concern  \nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would \nbe  sufficient  to  prevent  manifest  injustice.    Menchel  told  OPR,  “I  don’t  believe  anybody  at  the  \ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of \nthe conduct.  I think that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not if we took this case to \ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”  \n During the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept \na plea for an 18-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term.  The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made.  Villafaña \nattributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, but Acosta attributed it to a decision \nmade during the negotiating process by Villafaña and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his \nattorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.  \n  OPR  found  no  contemporaneous  documents  showing  the  basis  for  the  two-year  term.    \nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR \nwas  unable  to  determine  who  initially  proposed  the  two-year  term  of  incarceration  or  why  that  \nterm,  as  opposed  to  other  possible  and  lengthier  terms,  was  settled  on  for  the  initial  offer.    The  \nterm  was  not  tied  to  statutory  or  guidelines  sentences  for  potential  federal  charges  or,  as  far  as  \nOPR could determine, possible state charges.  Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the \ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and \nrather  than  a  “floor”  for  negotiations,  it  became  a  “ceiling”  that  was  further  reduced  during  the  \nnegotiations.  OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was \ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other \ntraditional  sentencing  factors  such  as  deterrence,  either  of  Epstein  or  other  offenders  of  similar  \ncrimes.    Instead,  as  previously  noted,  it  appears  that  Acosta  primarily  considered  only  a  \npunishment  that  was  somewhat  more  than  that  to  which  the  state  had  agreed.    As  a  result,  the  \nUSAO had little room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to \nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration \nthat  was  not  much  more  than  what  the  state  had  initially  sought  and  which  was  significantly  \ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.    \n In sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him \nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his own goal of serving as a “backstop” to the \nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis.  In assessing the case \nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for \na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in \naddressing it.   \n\n \n182 \n \nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA  \nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral attacks and continued appeals raised the \nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith.  At various points, individual members of the \nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given \nto  whether  the  USAO  should  declare  a  unilateral  breach.    Indeed,  on  November  24,  2008,  the  \nUSAO  gave  notice  that  it  deemed  Epstein’s  participation  in  work  release  to  be  a  breach  of  the  \nagreement  but  ultimately  took  no  further  action.    Acosta  told  OPR:    “I  was  personally  very  \nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 20, and had I envisioned that entire collateral attack, \nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”  \nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review \nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state \nguilty  plea,  declared  Epstein  to  be  in  breach  and  proceeded  to  charge  him  federally.    When  \nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to \naddress  Epstein’s  concerns.    He  told  OPR  that  because  the  USAO  is  part  of  the  Department  of  \nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object.  During his \nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he attributed to Acosta’s \nprior  Department  experience.    Sloman,  however,  believed  the  USAO  gave  Epstein  “[t]oo  much  \nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to \nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA.  Furthermore, Epstein’s \ndefense  counsel  repeatedly  and  carefully  made  clear  they  were  not  repudiating  the  agreement.    \nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order \nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort \nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach.  Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was \nSloman,  that  a  unilateral  decision  to  rescind  the  non-prosecution  agreement  would  result  in  \ncollateral litigation that would further delay matters and make what was likely a difficult trial even \nharder. \n Acosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable.  A court \nwould  have  been  unlikely  to  have  determined  that  defense  counsel’s  appeal  of  the  NPA  to  the  \nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient \nto negate the agreement.  However, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach \nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed.  For example, \nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and \nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2007” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his \nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007.”  (Emphasis added.)  Acosta also \nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2007 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told \ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.  \nFollowing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that \nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to \ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Attorney had at least implicitly agreed.   \nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process   \n  The  question  at  the  center  of  much  of  the  public  controversy  concerning  the  USAO’s  \nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which \n\n \n183 \n \nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant \nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense.  As OPR has set forth \nin  substantial  detail  in  this  Report,  OPR  did  not  find  evidence  to  support  allegations  that  the  \nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims.  Instead, the result can more \nappropriately  be  tied  to  Acosta’s  misplaced  concerns  about  interfering  with  a  traditionally  state  \ncrime and intruding on state authority.  Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had \nset, even when Villafaña and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta \nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.   \nMany  of  the  problems  that  developed  might  have  been  avoided  had  Acosta  engaged  in  \ngreater  consultation  with  his  staff  before  making  key  decisions.    The  contemporaneous  records  \nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants.  Acosta \nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case.  Lourie \ntold  OPR  that  it  was  “unusual  to  have  a  U.S.  Attorney  get  involved  with  this  level  of  detail.”    \nMenchel told OPR, “I know we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay?  And I’m sure with \nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”  \nLourie similarly told OPR: \nWell, . . . he would have been talking to Jeff and Matt, talking to me \nto  the  extent  that  he  did,  he  would  have  been  looking  at  the  Pros  \nMemo  and  .  .  .  the  guidance  from  CEOS,  he  would  have  been  \nreading  the  defense  attorney’s  letters,  maybe  talking  to  the  State  \nAttorney,  I  don’t  know,  just  .  .  .  all  these  different  sources  of  \ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you \nknow, that he was, he was reading everything.  Apparently, he, you \nknow, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff . . . .   \nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels \nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knowledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafaña and, to a lesser extent, Lourie.  Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution \nmemorandum on his own, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through \nthe  front  office  “[b]ecause  there  was  front  office  involvement  from  the  get  go.”    Yet,  although  \nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as \noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions.  OPR observed that as a \nconsequence,  management  of  the  case  suffered  from  both  an  absence  of  ownership  of  the  \ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.   \nOn  occasion,  Villafaña  included  Acosta  directly  in  emails,  but  often,  information  upon  \nwhich  Acosta  relied  for  his  decisions  and  information  about  the  decisions  Acosta  had  made  \ntraveled  through  multiple  layers  between  Acosta  and  Villafaña.    Villafaña  did  draft  a  detailed,  \nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have \nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.  \nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such \nas  Oosterbaan’s  strong  opinion  from  the  outset  in  favor  of  the  prosecution  or  of  Villafaña’s  \nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA.  Acosta interpreted the state \nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that \nwhen making his decision to resolve the matter though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to \n\n \n184 \n \nwhich Villafaña and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue \na broader state indictment.   \nOne example illustrates this communication gap.  In a September 20, 2007 email to Lourie \nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for \nEpstein  to  plead  to  both  state  and  federal  charges),  Acosta  noted,  “I  don’t  typically  sign  plea  \nagreements.    We  should  only  go  forward  if  the  trial  team  supports  and  signs  this  agreement.    I  \ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”  \n(Emphasis  added.)    In  his  email  to  Villafaña,  Lourie  attached  Acosta’s  email  and  instructed  \nVillafaña  to  “change  the  signature  block  to  your  name and  send  as  final  to  Jay  [Lefkowitz].”    \n(Emphasis added.)  Villafaña raised no objection to signing the agreement.  Acosta told OPR that \nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him know” if they did not feel \ncomfortable with the agreement.  Villafaña, however, told OPR that she did not understand that \nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted \nher to sign it because he was taking an “arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his \ndeal.”  The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity \nto  reflect  and  stop  the  process  if  she  believed  the  deal  was  inappropriate,  but  the  line  AUSA  \nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself \nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.   \n  As another example, at one point, Villafaña, frustrated and concerned about the decisions \nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded \nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request.  Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting \nVillafaña from speaking to Acosta, Villafaña interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could \nnot  seek  a  meeting  with  Acosta.    As  a  consequence,  Acosta  made  his  decision  about  a  state  \nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafaña.  Acosta told OPR \nthat he was unaware that Villafaña had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with \nher if she had asked him directly.  OPR did not find any written evidence of a meeting involving \nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafaña—the person most knowledgeable about the \nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to \noffer the two-year term, and Villafaña said she did not have any input into the decision.  Although \na  U.S.  Attorney  is  certainly  not  required  to  have  such  direct  input,  and  it  may  be  that  Menchel  \npresented what he believed to be Villafaña’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware \nof Villafaña’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.\n256\n   \nTwo  logistical  problems  hindered  effective  communication.    First,  the  senior  managers  \ninvolved  in  the  case—Acosta,  Sloman,  and  Menchel—had  offices  located  in  Miami,  while  the  \noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, \nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach.  Consequently, Villafaña’s discussions with her senior \n                                                 \n256\n    In  her  2017  Declaration  in  the  CVRA  litigation,  Villafaña  stated  that,  given  the  challenges  of  obtaining  \nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the matter \nwas  in  the  best  interests  of  the  [USAO]  and  the  victims  as  a  whole.    The  [USAO]  had  also  reached  that  same  \nconclusion.”  Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafaña in fact supported the NPA.  In her \nOPR interview, however, Villafaña drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that \nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.    \n\n \n185 \n \nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop \nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.\n257\n   \nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times.  Menchel’s last day in the office was \nAugust 3, 2007, the day he sent to the defense his letter making the initial offer, and presumably \nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his \noutstanding work.  Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding how to resolve the matter.  \nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the \nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key \nprovisions  were  continuously  added  or  modified  while  Villafaña  pressed  to  meet  her  late-\nSeptember deadline.  Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he \nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was \ntraveling between the two locations.  Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing, \nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting \nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed.  Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a \nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding \nof the case and full ownership of the decisions that were being made.  Villafaña certainly felt that \nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta.  Acosta, however, \ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns.  Did \nit do the . . . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and \nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”    \nThe consequences flowing from the lack of ownership and effective communication can \nbe  seen  in  the  NPA  itself.    As  demonstrated  by  the  contemporaneous  communications,  the  \nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited \nproposals previously rejected.  Meanwhile, Villafaña sought to keep to a deadline that would allow \nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement.  In the end, \nAcosta accepted several terms with little apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications. \nThe  USAO’s  agreement  not  to  prosecute  “any  potential  co-conspirators”  is  a  notable  \nexample.   As previously noted, the only written discussion about the term that OPR found was \nVillafaña’s  email  to  Lourie  and  the  incoming  West  Palm  Beach  manager,  with  copies  to  her  \nco-counsel  and  direct  supervisor,  stating  that  she  did  not  believe  the  provision  “hurts  us,”  and  \nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafaña recalled any further discussion about the provision.  Although \nOPR  did  not  find  evidence  showing  that  Acosta,  Lourie,  or  Villafaña  intended  the  scope  of  the  \nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision \nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct, \nwithin  the  limitations  set  by  the  overall  agreement.    This  broad  prosecution  declination  would  \nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient \ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no \nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not \nbe developed implicating others.  Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third \n                                                 \n257\n  In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s, \nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”   \n\n \n186 \n \nparties.\n258\n    The  rush  to  reach  a  resolution  should  not  have  led  the  USAO  to  agree  to  such  a  \nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification \nfor the provision.  It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have \nitself  caused  the  negotiations  to  fail;  the  USAO’s  rejection  of  the  defense  proposal  concerning  \nimmigration  consequences  did  not  affect  Epstein’s  willingness  to  sign  the  agreement.    The  \npossibility  that  individuals  other  than  Epstein’s  four  female  assistants  could  have  criminal  \nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused \nmore careful consideration of the provision.          \nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with little apparent consideration \nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense \ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of \nthe investigation.  Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release \ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would \nbe  violating  the  terms  of  the  NPA  by  disclosing  information  to  victims  or  the  special  master.  \nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province \nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.     \nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Attorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA \nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given \ncase; indeed, U.S. Attorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.  \nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical \ndecision to resolve the matter through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could \nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time.  This case, however, was different \nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the \nusual  plea  agreement.    Contemporaneous  records  show  that  Acosta  believed  the  case  should  be  \nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case \nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight.  Acosta may \nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing \n                                                 \n258\n  CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR this provision was “very unusual.”  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t know how it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified.  I \njust don’t know how that works.”  Villafaña’s co-counsel told OPR:   \n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed \nto do at the Department of Justice. . . .  I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . . .  \n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for \nexample,  for  crimes  of  violence,  .  .  .  for  anything  beyond  the  specific  offense  \nwhich  was  being  investigated  during  the  specific  time  periods  and  for  you  and  \nnobody  else.    I  mean  on  rare  occasion  I’ve  seen  cases  where  say  someone  was  \ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. . . . And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s \nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you \nknow  the  husband’s  willing  to  go  and  take  the  weight  .  .  .  .    This  is  not  one  of  \nthose. \nDeputy Attorney General Filip called the provision “pretty weird.”   Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR \nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.  A senior AUSA with substantial \nexperience  prosecuting  sex  crimes  against  children  commented  that  it  was  “horrendous”  to  provide  immunity  for  \nparticipants in such conduct.   \n\n \n187 \n \nfrom Villafaña and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision \nshould  have  been  made  only  after  a  full  consideration  of  all  of  the  possible  ramifications  and  \nconsequences of pushing the matter into the state court system, with which neither Villafaña nor \nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and \npossible  means  of  overcoming  those  issues.    OPR  did  not  find  evidence  indicating  that  such  a  \nmeeting  or  discussion  with  the  full  team  was  held  before  the  decision  was  made  to  pursue  the  \nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or \nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed.  As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,  \n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done \nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate how this train is \nmoving?” \nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions \nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able \nto manipulate the process to his benefit.  Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about \nsome  of  the  issues  that  Acosta  felt  were  important  and  that  factored  into  his  decision-making.    \nThere does not seem to be a point, however, at which those differing opinions were considered \nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him \nfollowed and attempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond attaining the three \ncore elements.  As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of \nthe  problems  that  developed  with  the  NPA  might  have  been  avoided  with  a  more  thoughtful  \napproach.  As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellow U.S. Attorney today, I \nwould say, think it through.”\n259\n \n  No  one  of  the  individual  problems  discussed  above  necessarily  demonstrates  poor  \njudgment by itself.  However, in combination, the evidence shows that the state-based resolution \nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process. \nFrom  the  time  the  USAO  opened  its  investigation,  Acosta  recognized  the  federal  interest  in  \nprosecuting  Epstein,  yet  after  that  investigation  had  run  for  more  than  a  year,  he  set  the  \ninvestigation  on  a  path  not  originally  contemplated.    Having  done  so,  he  had  responsibility  for  \nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before putting an end to \na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct.  Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the \nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the \nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question \nthe  motives  of  the  prosecutors  and  whether  any  reasonable  measure  of  justice  was  achieved.    \nAccordingly,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta  exercised  poor  judgment  in  that  he  chose  a  course  of  \naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an \nattorney exercising good judgment to take. \n  \n                                                 \n259\n    In  commenting  on  OPR’s  draft  report,  Acosta’s  attorney  acknowledged  that  “[t]he  matter  would  have  \nbenefited from more consistent staffing and attention.” \n\n \n188 \n \n[Page Intentionally Left Blank] \n  \n\n \n189 \n \nCHAPTER THREE \nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS  \nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS \nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nI. OVERVIEW \n Chapter Three describes the events pertaining to the federal government’s interactions and \ncommunications  with  victims  in  the  Epstein  case,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  \nfactual background set forth in Chapter Two, Part One.  This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal \nauthorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation, \nas well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions.  OPR discusses key events relating to the USAO’s and \nthe FBI’s interactions with victims before and after the signing of the NPA, beginning with the \nFBI’s  initial  contact  with  victims  through  letters  informing  them  that  the  FBI  had  initiated  an  \ninvestigation.  A timeline of key events is provided on the following page. \nII. THE CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 \nA. History \nIn December 1982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report \noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime \nvictims.    The  Task  Force  concluded  that  victims  have  been  “overlooked,  their  pleas  for  justice  \nhave   gone   unheeded,   and   their   wounds—personal,   emotional   and   financial—have   gone   \nunattended.”\n260\n  Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the \ncriminal justice system:  the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act \nof 1984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and \nLaw  Enforcement  Act  of  1994,  the  Antiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996,  the  \nVictim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, and the Justice for All Act of 2004.\n261\n      \nThe CVRA, enacted on October 30, 2004, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed \nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”\n262\n  The \nCVRA  resulted  from  a  multi-year  bipartisan  effort  to  approve  a  proposal  for  a  constitutional  \namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’  \n                                                 \n260\n  President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at ii (Dec. 1982). \n261\n  See Pub.

Enumerated Rights \nThe CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed \nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”\n265\n  \nInitially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime \nvictims the following eight rights: \n(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  \n \n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public \ncourt proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or \nof any release or escape of the accused.  \n \n(3)  The  right  not  to  be  excluded  from  any  such  public  court  \nproceeding,  unless  the  court,  after  receiving  clear  and  convincing  \nevidence,   determines   that   testimony   by   the   victim   would   be   \nmaterially  altered  if  the  victim  heard  other  testimony  at  that  \nproceeding.  \n \n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the \ndistrict  court  involving  release,  plea,  sentencing,  or  any  parole  \nproceeding.  \n \n(5)  The  reasonable  right  to  confer  with  the  attorney  for  the  \nGovernment in the case.  \n                                                 \n263\n  See 150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (1) be treated with \nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender; \n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the \ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial; \n(5) confer with an attorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction, \nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender.  42 U.S.C. § 10606(b) (1990).  The relevant text of the VRRA \nis set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section 1.B of this Report. \n264\n  150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004).  Although nine congressional hearings were held between 1996 and \n2003  concerning  amending  the  Constitution  to  address  victims’  rights,  neither  chamber  of  Congress  voted  on  \nlegislation proposing an amendment.  United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-09-54, Report \nto Congressional Committees:  Crime Victims’ Rights Act – Increasing Awareness, Modifying the Complaint Process \nand  Enhancing  Compliance  Monitoring  Will  Improve  Implementation  of  the  Act  at  16  (Dec.  2008)  (GAO  CVRA \nAwareness Report).     \n265\n  The relevant text of the CVRA is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section I.A of this Report. \n\n \n192 \n \n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.  \n \n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.  \n \n(8)  The  right  to  be  treated  with  fairness  and  with  respect  for  the  \nvictim’s dignity and privacy. \nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part \nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or \nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights \nwere  afforded.    The  passage  of  the  CVRA  repealed  the  rights  portion  of  the  VRRA  (42  U.S.C.  \n§ 10606), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to \nprovide  certain  victim  services,  such  as  counseling  and  medical  care  referrals  (42  U.S.C.  \n§ 10607(c)).  Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide \nvictim  services,  which  attach  upon  the  detection  of  a  crime,  while  the  CVRA  contains  court-\nenforceable rights that attach upon the filing of a charging instrument.   \nIn 2015, Congress amended the CVRA and added the following two rights:\n266\n \n \n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain \nor deferred prosecution agreement.  \n \n(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the \nservices  described  in  section  503(c)  of  the  Victims’  Rights  and  \n5HVWLWXWLRQ $FW RI \u0014\u001c\u001c\u0013 \u000b\u0017\u0015 8\u00116\u0011&\u0011 \u0014\u0013\u0019\u0013\u001a\u000bF\f\fDQG SURYLGHG FRQWDFW\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the \nDepartment of Justice. \n \nIII. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF \n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION \nA. April 1, 2005 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review” \n In  2005,  Department  management  requested  informal  guidance  from  the  Department’s  \nOffice  of  Legal  Counsel  (OLC)  regarding  interpretation  of  the  CVRA’s  definition  of  “crime  \nvictim.”\n267\n    On  April  1,  2005,  OLC  provided  “preliminary  and  informal”  guidance  by  email,  \nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon \nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or \nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”\n268\n    \n                                                 \n266\n  H. Rep. No. 114-7 (Jan. 27, 2015). \n267\n  OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive \nbranch agencies.   \n268\n  The OLC 2005 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Attorney \nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Attorney General John E. Bies (Dec. 17, 2010), published as Office of Legal Counsel, \n\n \n193 \n \n OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and \nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus \ntethered  to  the  identification  of  a  ‘Federal  offense,’  an  event  that  occurs  with  the  filing  of  a  \ncomplaint.”  OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies \nthe  “‘rights  of  crime  victims  in  the  Federal  judicial  system’”  and  a  complaint  “commences  the  \n‘judicial  process’  and  places  an  offense  within  the  ‘judicial  system,’”  the  legislature  must  have  \nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.   \n \n  OLC  also  found  that  the  language  of  the  CVRA  rights  supported  its  interpretation.    For  \nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect.  Additionally, \nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings \ninvolving  release,  plea,  sentencing  or  parole—none  of  which  commence  prior  to  the  filing  of  a  \ncomplaint.” \n \nB. 2005 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance \nIn  May  2005,  the  Department  updated  its  Attorney  General  Guidelines  for  Victim  and  \nWitness Assistance (2005 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.\n269\n  The 2005 Guidelines specifically \ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution \nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their \nCVRA rights, which in 2005 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.   \nThe 2005 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA \nduties  and  divided  criminal  cases  into  an  “investigation  stage,”  a  “prosecution  stage,”  and  a  \n“corrections stage.”  The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights \nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.   \nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency, \nthe  Special  Agent  in  Charge  was  responsible  for  identifying  the  victims  “[a]t  the  earliest  \nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and \nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.   \n[D]uring   the   investigative   stage,   [the   Department]   mandates   \ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C \n§  10607,  which  requires  federal  officials  to,  among  other  things,  \nidentify  victims,  protect  victims,  arrange  for  victims  to  receive  \nreasonable   protection   from   suspected   offenders,   and   provide   \n                                                 \nThe  Availability  of  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Under  the  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Act  of  2004  (Dec.  17,  2010)  (“OLC  \nAvailability  of  Crime  Victims’  Rights  (2010)”)  and  available  at\n https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/ \nopinions/2010/12/31/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf.    “That  [2005]  informal  guidance  did  not  foreclose  the  \npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.”  OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2010) at 1.   \n269\n The 2005 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.  The \nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA, \nwhich instructed the Attorney General to develop and implement such guidelines.  Victim and Witness Protection Act, \nPub. L. No. 97-291, § 6, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982).  The 2005 Guidelines were superseded in October 2011, as explained \nbelow. \n\n \n194 \n \ninformation  about  available  services  for  victims.    Therefore,  even  \nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if \ncharges  have  not  been  filed  in  their  cases,  the  [D]epartment  may  \nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function \nas some CVRA rights.\n270\n \nThe 2005 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges \nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.”  The “U.S. Attorney in whose \ndistrict  the  prosecution  is  pending”  was  responsible  for  making  “best  efforts  to  see  that  crime  \nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.   \nDuring  the  prosecution  stage,  the  2005  Guidelines  required  the  U.S.  Attorney,  or  a  \ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an \noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or \nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed.  The 2005 Guidelines required the responsible \nofficial  to  “provide  the  victim  with  reasonable,  accurate,  and  timely  notice  of  any  public  court  \nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”   \nThe 2005 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult \nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea \nnegotiations,  and  pretrial  diversion.    In  particular,  the  2005  Guidelines  required  the  responsible  \nofficial  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  notify  identified  victims  of,  and  consider  victims’  views  \nabout, prospective plea negotiations.  Nevertheless, the 2005 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to \n“consider  factors  relevant  to  the  wisdom  and  practicality  of  giving  notice  and  considering  [the  \nvictim’s]  views”  in  light  of  various  factors  such  as  “[w]hether  the  proposed  plea  involves  \nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case \nand  the  effect  that  relaying  any  information  may  have  on  the  defendant’s  right  to  a  fair  trial.”    \nLastly, the 2005 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather \nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”  \nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration \nfollowing  a  conviction.    Depending  on  the  agency  having  custody  of  the  defendant,  the  U.S.  \nAttorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.    \nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME \nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION \nA. USAO Training \nAs  U.S.  Attorney,  Acosta  disseminated  the  May  2005  updated  Guidelines  to  USAO  \npersonnel with a transmittal memorandum dated February 27, 2006, stating that he expected each \nrecipient  “to  read  and  become  familiar  with  the  [2005]  Guidelines.”    Acosta  noted  in  the  \nmemorandum  that  the  USAO  had  recently  held  an  “all  office  training”  addressing  the  2005  \nGuidelines  and  that  new  USAO  attorneys  who  missed  the  training  were  required  to  view  a  \nvideotaped  version  of  the  training  “immediately.”    Acosta  further  noted  that  the  USAO’s  \n                                                 \n270\n  GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.   \n\n \n195 \n \nvictim/witness  staff  were  “ready  to  assist  you  with  the  details  of  victim  notification,  and  other  \nareas for which United States Attorney[’]s Offices are now explicitly responsible under the act.”  \nThe  USAO’s  Victim  Witness  Program  Coordinator  told  OPR  that  the  USAO  provided  annual  \nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.  \nB. The Automated Victim Notification System \n Both  the  FBI  and  the  USAO  manage  contacts  with  crime  victims  through  the  Victim  \nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United \nStates Attorneys.  The 2005 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to \nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or \nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.”  The VNS is separate from agency \ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO.  Both the FBI and the USAO \nuse  the  VNS  to  generate  form  letters  to  victims  at  various  points  in  the  investigation  and  the  \nprosecution of a criminal case.  Although each form letter can be augmented to add some limited \nindividual matter-specific content, the letters contain specific language concerning the purpose of \nthe  contact  that  cannot  be  removed  (such  as  the  arrest  of  the  defendant  or  the  scheduling  of  a  \nsentencing hearing).\n271\n   \n In the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during \nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system.  The FBI’s Victim Specialist \nexports  the  victim  information  data  from  the  FBI’s  case  management  system  into  the  VNS  \ndatabase.  Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.  \nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate \nseven  different  form  notification  letters:    (1)  initial  notification;  (2)  case  is  under  investigation;  \n(3)  arrest  of  the  defendant;  (4)  declination  of  prosecution;  (5)  other;  (6)  advice  of  victim  rights;  \nand (7) investigation closed.   \n After a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s \nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.\n272\n  The USAO imports \ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS \ndata.    The  USAO’s  Victim  Witness  Specialist  uses  the  VNS  to  generate  form  letters  providing  \nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of \nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.     \n                                                 \n271\n  U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report 08-04, The Department of \nJustice’s  Victim  Notification  System  at  29  (Jan.  2008),  available  at  https://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUSA/a0804/  \nfinal.pdf.  The 2008 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the \nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information \nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in \nthe same letter.”   \n272\n  The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact:  the FBI title is \n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.” \n\n \n196 \n \nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets \n The 2005 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that \nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness  coordinator  or  specialist  .  .  .  .”    At  the  time  of  the  Epstein investigation,  FBI  agents  \nnationwide routinely followed a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for \nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.”  The “Help for \nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights.  The pamphlet stated:  \n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime, \nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you \nare afforded those rights.”  The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided \nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.  The pamphlet entitled “The \nDepartment  of  Justice  Victim  Notification  System”  provided  an  overview  of  the  VNS  and  \ninstructions on how to access the system.      \nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS \nA. August 2006:  The FBI Victim Notification Letters \n On August 8, 2006, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim \nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim \nNotification  Form”  naming  30  victims  in  the  Epstein investigation  and  stating  that  “additional  \npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.\n273\n  Thereafter, the Victim Specialist \nentered  individual  victim  contact  information  she  received  from  the  case  agent  into  the  VNS  \nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial letter to a particular \nvictim.  The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the \n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n274\n    \n According to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2006, the FBI Victim Specialist \nused the VNS to generate FBI letters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the \neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive \ncurrent status information about the matter.  The FBI letters described the case as “currently under \ninvestigation”  and  noted  that  “[t]his  can  be  a  lengthy  process  and  we  request  your  continued  \npatience  while  we  conduct  a  thorough  investigation.”    The  letters  also  stated  that  some  of  the  \nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment:  “We will make our best efforts \nto ensure you are accorded the rights described.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring \nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility \nof the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.”  A \nsample letter follows.  \n                                                 \n273\n    These  30  were  drawn  from  the  PBPD  investigative  file  and  included  individuals  that  the  PBPD  had  not  \ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed. \n274\n  The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as \nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from \n[her], the Victim Specialist.”    \n\n197\nAuvust 28, 2006 \nU.S. D•p1rlrn1nl of JuiOte \nPcdcnl Bureau ortnvc.:1tl~1tLJou \nFBI· West Pahn !leach \nSujteS00 \nSOS Sou1h Flogl•r Drivt \nWo,t Polm llc=h, FL 33401 \nPhone (S61) 833-7517 \nFax: (561) tll-7970 \nYour name wu rere:red to tho FBl'll Vlcll,n Asslsiance Program as being a i:osslblc victim ot a fcdeml \ncrime.

Villafaña told OPR that she was “generally aware \nthat the FBI sends letters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.”    Villafaña  told  OPR  the  “FBI  had  their  own  victim  notification  system  and  their  own  \nguidelines  for  when  information  had  to  be  provided  and  what  information  had  to  be  provided.”    \nMoreover,  Villafaña  “didn’t  know  when  [FBI]  letters  went  out”  or  “what  they  said.”\n276\nNevertheless, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters she drafted to interfere with \nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.   \nIn August 2006, Villafaña drafted her letters to victims who had been initially identified \nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file.  Villafaña told OPR that she “made the decision \nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory letter and determined to \nwhom they would be sent.  Although these letters contained CVRA rights information, Villafaña \nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims know the federal \ninvestigation  “would  be  a  different  process”  from  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  investigation  in  \nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.”  Villafaña told OPR that in a \ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate \n275\nOPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an \nFBI  letter  to  that  particular  victim,  as  the  span  of  time  between  the  two  events  varied  from  a  few  days  to  months.    \nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI letter subsequent to her interview, and some \nFBI letters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents.  Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS \ndata revealed some letters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file.  OPR \ncould not confirm whether such letters were mailed or delivered.   \n276\nVillafaña, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did \nnot  review  the  FBI  notification  letters  and  did  not  see  them until  she  gathered  them  for  production  in  the  CVRA  \nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008.    \nf)ID hav~~I~ q~J:l$''1'.1tleli I al~mhi Btltt'\n1\npft.a9: oon1nclthc0Hi0:il.isttdabo • WhCJ'! \ny~ cam, pk~c provide the liil1:1munk, located s.'thi; twpoffhis I~ F~ W; yourpsriieip n.011:in \nthe notificruton p.1111¢ of : JJnisram is V(JJ _nruy; In order to cmit~nneto rccci\\'e ru:itifiomonSiJ it is your \n-ptll~lbl]rty lo, keep :,'-OU\" Cim1l'lct in.fur.motion cumn \nVli;tim Spci:aia!list \n\n \n199 \n \nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña directed \nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the letters “as they were conducting interviews.”  Villafaña \ntold  OPR  that  the  USAO  had  “no  standardized  way  to  do  any  victim  notifications  prior  to”  the  \nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafaña did not use a template or VNS-generated letter \nfor content, but instead used a letter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”\n277\n   \n  The  letters  contained  contact  information  for  Villafaña,  the  FBI  case  agent,  and  the  \nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.  \nThe USAO letters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be \nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.”  The letters stated that, in \naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and \npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a \nlist  of  counseling  and  medical  services.\n278\n    Lastly,  the  letters  advised  that  investigators  for  the  \ndefense  might  contact  the  victims  and  those  who  felt  threatened  or  harassed  should  contact  \nVillafaña or the FBI case agent.   \nAlthough the USAO letters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters to activate the \nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed attached only after the filing of a criminal charge.  \nVillafaña told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI letter and \na USAO letter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO letter “was coming \nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].”  Later, in the course of \nthe CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of \nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even \nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging \ndecisions had been made.”\n279\n       \nVillafaña informed Lourie and Sloman about the letters, but the letters were not reviewed \nby any of Villafaña’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management \ntask.\n \n Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified, \nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.”  Similarly, Menchel told \nOPR,    \n                                                 \n277\n  Villafaña told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she showed the letter to the USAO’s Victim Witness \nSpecialist who “said it was fine.”  The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not \nfile a charging document in the Epstein matter, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not \nassume  responsibility  for  victim  contact.    The  USAO’s  Victim  Witness  Specialist  had  no  contact  with  Epstein’s  \nvictims,  and  OPR’s  examination  of  VNS  data  revealed  no  USAO  case  number  linked  to  the  FBI’s  VNS  data  \nconcerning  the Epstein investigation.    OPR  did  locate  some  victim  contact  information  in  the  VNS  relating  to  the  \nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2008. \n278\n    Through  its  administration  of  the  Crime  Victims  Fund,  the  Department’s  Office  for  Victims  of  Crime  \nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime. \n279\n  Villafaña informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions \nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide \na higher standard of contact.”    \n\n \n200 \n \n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider \nit  to  be  within  my  purview  to  ensure  that  appropriate  victim  \nnotifications occurred in every matter investigated or brought by the \nOffice.  I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness  coordinators  to  work  with  line  prosecutors  to  ensure  that  \nappropriate    victim    notifications    occurred    in    every    matter    \ninvestigated or brought by the Office.  \nC. USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered  \n The FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met \n[with] the girls.”  The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO letters and FBI letters \nto some victims following in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a \nvictim with a letter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to \nthat set forth in the FBI letters.\n280\n  The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a \nfew” letters to victims.  The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI letters to \nvictims and she provided some FBI letters to the case agent for hand delivery. \n      Nevertheless,  the  case  agent  told  OPR  that  she  “did  not  sit  there  and  go  through  every  \nright” with the victims.  She stated, however, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI \nVictim Specialist] giving the letter, me giving a letter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew \nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that \nthey could call for that.”  The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected \nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and \nresources.”   \nVI. AUGUST  2006  –  SEPTEMBER  2007:    FBI  AND  USAO  CONTACTS  WITH  \nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED  \n Early  in  the  investigation,  Villafaña  informed  her  supervisors  that,  up  to  that  point,  \n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story.  Getting \nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.”  Between August 2006 and \nSeptember 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims.  On \na few occasions, Villafaña met with victims together with the FBI.\n   Villafaña’s May 1, 2007 draft \nindictment  included  substantive  crimes  against  multiple  victims,  and  Villafaña  described  the  \ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.  \nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to \nthe FBI case agents and Villafaña concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and \nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome \nof  the  investigation.    Before  the  USAO  entered  into  the  NPA,  however,  no  one  from  the  \n                                                 \n280\n    The  case  agent  told  OPR,  “I  remember  giving  letters  to  the  girls  when  we  would  talk  to  them  at  .  .  .  the  \nconclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact \ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”   \n\n \n201 \n \ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through \na state plea.   \nA. The   Case   Agents   and   Villafaña   Solicit   Some   Victims’   Opinions   about   \nResolving the Federal Investigation  \n  Villafaña  told  OPR  that  when  she  and  the  case  agents  met  with  victims,  “we  would  ask  \nthem how they wanted the case to be resolved.”\n281\n \nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea.  Some \nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all.  Most of them did \nnot  want  to  have  to  come  to  court  and  testify.    They  were  very  \nworried about their privacy rights.  Some of them wanted him to go \nto jail.  But . . . [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with \nthe State Attorney’s Office.  And so, I felt like sending them back to \nthe State Attorney’s Office was not something that they would have \nsupported.    \nVillafaña told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about \ntheir  safety,”  and  were  worried  that  Epstein  would  find  out  about  their  participation  in  the  \ninvestigation.  In her 2017 declaration submitted in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that the \ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my \nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and \nallow the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”\n282\n  She also noted that some \nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would \nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”   \nIn the FBI case agent’s 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During \ninterviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be \nprosecuted.”  She further described the concerns of some of the victims:   \nThroughout  the  investigation,  we  interviewed  many  [of  Epstein’s]  \nvictims . . . .  A majority of the victims expressed concern about the \npossible disclosure of their identities to the public.  A number of the \nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents \nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.  Additionally, \n                                                 \n281\n    Villafaña  created  for  OPR  a  chart  listing  victims  identified  in  the  state  and  federal  investigations,  with  \nnotations  indicating  several  with  whom  Villafaña  recalled  discussing  their  opinions  about  resolving  the  case.    The  \nchart, however, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafaña told OPR that the information contained in the \nchart  was  based  on  her  memory  of  her  interactions  with  each  victim.    OPR  was  unable  to  determine  the  details  or  \nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2007, because Villafaña did not have contemporaneous \nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information \nabout the victims’ desired outcomes.  The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential \nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.      \n282\n    In  the  declaration,  Villafaña  stated,  “Jane  Doe  2  specifically  told  me  that  she  did  not  want  Epstein  \nprosecuted.”   \n\n \n202 \n \nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible \nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.  Overall, \nmany  of  the  victims  were  troubled  about  the  existence  of  the  \ninvestigation.    They  displayed  feelings  of  embarrassment  and  \nhumiliation  and  were  reluctant  to  talk  to  investigators.    Some  \nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even \nto  speak  to  us.    Our  concerns  about  the  victims’  well-being  and  \ngetting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of \nthe investigation. \n \nThe  case  agent  told  OPR  that  although  she  encountered  victims  who  were  “strong”  and  \n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.  \nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to know,” and “wanted to forget.”\n283\n   \n  As  of  September  24,  2007,  the  date  the  NPA  was  signed,  Villafaña  informed  Epstein  \nattorney Lefkowitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed \nminors”  and  6  other  potential  minor  victims  who  had  not  yet  been  interviewed  by  the  FBI.\n284\n  \nAlthough  the  government  had  contacted  many  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed,  Villafaña  \nacknowledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding \nthe agreement.”  \nB. Before  the  NPA  Is  Signed,  Villafaña  Expresses  Concern  That  Victims  Have  \nNot Been Consulted \n Before  the  NPA  was  signed, Villafaña  articulated  to  her  supervisors  concerns  about  the  \ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.  \n1. July 2007:  Villafaña’s Email Exchanges with Menchel \nIn July 2007, Villafaña learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez \na  possible  state  resolution  to  the  federal  investigation  of  Epstein.    Villafaña  was  upset  by  this  \ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns.  (A full account \nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.)  In that email, she \ntold  him  that  it  was  “inappropriate  [for  you]  to  make  a  plea  offer  that  you  know  is  completely  \nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me.  These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the \n                                                 \n283\n  The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her \nApril 2007 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”     \n284\n  The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the \ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2255.”    \nAlthough  the  charges  Villafaña  proposed  on  May  1,  2007,  were  based  on  crimes  against  13  victims,  thereafter,  as  \nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims \nas the federal investigation developed further evidence.  At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were \nbased on crimes against 19 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.   \n\n \n203 \n \nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”\n285\n  Villafaña explained to OPR her reference \nto the victims:   \n[M]y  concern  was  that  [Menchel]  was  violating  the  CVRA  which  \nrequires the attorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to \nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents \nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case.  So \nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to \nallegations  of  not  abiding  by  our  obligations  by  engaging  in  these  \nplea negotiations without letting us know about it.\n286\n  \nIn  his  reply  to  Villafaña’s  email,  and  after  noting  that  he  found  her  email  “totally  \ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that \n“[a]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Attorney to exercise \nappropriate  discretion  in  deciding  whether  certain  pleas  are  appropriate  and  consistent  with”  \nDepartmental  policy.    Perceiving  Menchel’s  rebuke  as  a  criticism  of  her  judgment,  Villafaña  \nresponded,  “[R]aising  concerns  about  the  forgotten  voices  of  victims  in  this  case  should  not  be  \nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”   \nMenchel  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  view  his  conversation  with  Sanchez  as  a  plea  offer,  \nasserted  that  he  was  not  obligated  to  consult  with  victims  during  preliminary  settlement  \nnegotiations,  and  noted  that  he  left  the  USAO  before  the  NPA  was  fully  negotiated  or  signed.    \nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion \nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be vetted with victims . . . is not \neven . . . in the same universe as to how I think about this.”  Menchel also observed that on the \nvery day that Villafaña criticized him for engaging in settlement negotiations without consulting \nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafaña had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the \npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state \nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.\n287\n   \n                                                 \n285\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  “some  victims,  I  felt  strongly,  would  have  objected  to  [a  state-only  disposition].”    \nVillafaña stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the \nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the \nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “how they would like the case resolved.”  Villafaña asserted that \nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.”  Menchel told OPR that \nthe allegations in Villafaña’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line \nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”   \n286\n  As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were \nfiled against a defendant.   \n287\n  In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafaña’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended \nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.  \n\n \n204 \n \n2. Villafaña  Asserts  That  Her  Supervisors  Gave  Instructions  Not  to  \nConsult  Victims  about  the  Plea  Discussions,  but  Her  Supervisors  Do  \nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions \n Villafaña  told  OPR  that  during  an  “early”  meeting  with  Acosta,  Sloman,  and  Menchel,  \nwhich  took  place  when  “we  were  probably  just  entering  into  plea  negotiations,”  she  raised  the  \ngovernment’s  obligation  to  confer  with  victims.\n288\n    Initially,  Villafaña  told  OPR  she  was  \ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims].  Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told \nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction.  In \na  subsequent  OPR  interview,  Villafaña  recalled  that  when  she  raised  the  issue  of  notification  \nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  You can’t disclose them.”\n289\n  \nVillafaña remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.   \n Neither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafaña was directed \nnot to notify the victims.  Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view \n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused \non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the \nNPA  was  signed.”    Sloman  also  told  OPR  that  he  did  not  recall  a  meeting  at  which  victim  \nnotification was discussed.  Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any \ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter \ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein matter.”  Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not \nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO, \nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would \nhave been “premature” to consider notification.\n290\n   \n \n3. September 6, 2007:  Villafaña Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta, \nof   Oosterbaan’s   Opinion   That   Consultation   with   Victims   Was   \nRequired  \n On September 6, 2007, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the \ngovernment’s  then-pending  offer  to  the  defense,  Villafaña  raised  the  victim  consultation  issue,  \nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as \n[CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD] \n                                                 \n288\n  Villafaña could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2007.   \n289\n    Villafaña  also  recalled  Menchel  raising  a  concern  that  “telling  them  about  the  negotiations  could  cause  \nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”   \n290\n  In  commenting  on  OPR’s  draft  report,  Menchel’s  counsel  reiterated  his  contention  that  Villafaña’s  claim  \nabout  a  meeting  involving  Menchel  in  which  she  was  instructed  not  to  consult  with  victims  was  inaccurate  and  \ninconsistent with other evidence.  OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to \nwhich Menchel’s attorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafaña’s assertion that she had received an instruction from \na  supervisor  not  to  inform  victims  about  the  plea  negotiations.    However,  it  is  also  true  that  OPR  did  not  find  any  \nreference  in  the  emails  and  other  documents  dated  before  the  NPA  was  signed  to  a  meeting  at  which  victim  \nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims.  This is one of several events \nabout  which  Menchel  and  Villafaña  disagreed,  but  given  OPR’s  conclusion  that  the  Department  did  not  require  \nprosecutors  to  consult  with  victims  before  charges  were  brought,  OPR  does  not  reach  a  conclusion  regarding  the  \nalleged meeting and instruction.      \n\n \n205 \n \nChief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”\n291\n  Sloman forwarded this \nemail  to  Acosta.    Villafaña  recalled  that  Sloman  responded  to  her  email  by  telephone,  possibly  \nafter  he  had  spoken  to  Acosta,  and  stated,  “[Y]ou  can’t  do  that  now.”    Villafaña  did  not  recall  \nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction. \n  Villafaña  told  OPR  that  shortly  before  the  NPA  was  signed,  Sloman  told  her,  “[W]e’ve  \nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.”  Sloman did not \nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with \nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case.  Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that \nwe  had  to  consult  with  victims  prior  to  entering  into  the  NPA,”  and  “we  did  not  have  to  seek  \napproval from victims to resolve a case.  We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution \nin . . . filed cases.”  Sloman said that no one other than Villafaña raised the notification issue, and \nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the matter, Sloman “did not think that we \nhad  to  consult  with  victims  prior  to  entering  into  the  NPA.”    Lourie  told  OPR  that  he  had  no  \nmemory of Villafaña being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.\n292\n  Similarly, the \nattorney  who  assumed  Lourie’s  supervisory  duties  after  Lourie  transitioned  to  his  detail  in  the  \nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he \n“assumed that was being handled.”\n293\n     \n  Acosta  did  not  recall  the  September  6,  2007  email,  but  told  OPR  that  “there  is  no  \nrequirement  to  notify  [the  victims],  because  it’s  not  a  plea,  it’s  deferring  in  favor  of  a  state  \nprosecution.”    Acosta  told  OPR  that  he  could  not  recall  any  “pre-NPA  discussions”  regarding  \nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the \nvictims before entering into the NPA.\n294\n  Ultimately, Acosta acknowledged to OPR, “[C]learly, \ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had [consulted with the victims].” \nCEOS  Chief  Oosterbaan  told  OPR  that  he  disagreed  with  the  USAO’s  stance  that  the  \nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was \nnot  “an  abuse  of  discretion”  or  “an  ethical  issue,”  but  rather  reflected  a  “serious  and  legitimate  \n                                                 \n291\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  she  referred  to  Oosterbaan  in  the  email  because  “he  was  the  head  of  CEOS  and  \nbecause  I  think  they  were  tired  of  hearing  me  nag  them  [to  notify  the  victims].”    As  previously  noted,  Villafaña’s  \nstatement  that  victim  approval  had  to  be  obtained  was  incorrect.    Even  when  applicable,  the  CVRA  only  requires  \nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement.  Moreover, Villafaña’s comments concerning the \npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement \nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate \nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent letters to victims in August 2006.   \n292\n    Lourie  noted  that  during  this  period,  he  had  left  Florida  and  was  no  longer  the  supervising  AUSA  in  the  \noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knowledge” of the case.   \n293\n    The  AUSA  who  for  a  time  served  as  Villafaña’s  co-counsel  on  the  Epstein  investigation  similarly  did  not  \n“know anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the \ncase.  The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do \nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”   \n294\n  Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order \nto . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”    \n\n \n206 \n \ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.\n295\n  Oosterbaan’s disagreement was based on \npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a \nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].”  Oosterbaan also told OPR that whether or \nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,” \nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:   \nThe people I know, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying \nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically.  I just \ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying \n. . . to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . . \nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on \nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you.  You still do what you’re going \nto  do  but  .  .  .  it’s  hard  to  say  it  was  a  complete,  completely  clean  \nexercise  of  .  .  .  prosecutorial  discretion  when  [the  USAO]  didn’t  \nreally know what [the victims] would say.   \nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point \nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into \nand  [Epstein]  was  going  to  enter  a  guilty  plea  in  state  court  that  we  were  going  to  notify  the  \nvictims.”    \nVII. SEPTEMBER  24,  2007  –  JUNE  30,  2008:    AFTER  THE  NPA  IS  SIGNED,  THE  \nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS \nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the \ncase  agents  planned  to  inform  the  victims  about  the  resolution  of  the  federal  investigation.    \nHowever, the emails also show that the USAO was unclear about how much information could be \ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s \ndefense  counsel  regarding  victim  notifications.\n296\n    As  a  result,  although  the  expectation  in  the  \nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision, \nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense attorneys, \nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan.  In addition, Villafaña and the case \nagents  grew  concerned  that  notifying  the  victims  about  the  NPA  monetary  damages  provision  \nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial.  In \nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Attorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims \nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not \nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2008.    \n \n                                                 \n295\n  Oosterbaan stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with how . . . I dealt with \n[the USAO].”   \n296\n  The NPA nondisclosure provision stated:  “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part \nof any public record.  If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process \ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.” \n\n \n207 \n \nA. September – October 2007:  The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the \nNPA,  but  Stop  When  the  Case  Agent  Becomes  Concerned  about  Potential  \nImpeachment  \n  In  transmitting  the  signed  NPA  to  Villafaña  on  September  24,  2007,  defense  attorney  \nLefkowitz  asked  Villafaña  to  “do  whatever  you  can  to  prevent  [the  NPA]  from  becoming  \npublic.”\n297\n    Villafaña  forwarded  this  email  to  Acosta,  Lourie,  and  the  new  West  Palm  Beach  \nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.”  Acosta \nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required \nby  law  or  [FOIA]”  and  noted  that  because  the  USAO  would  not  proactively  inform  the  media  \nabout the NPA, “this is the State Attorney[’]s show.”\n298\n  Acosta added, “In other words, what more \ndoes he want?”  Villafaña responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief \nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.”  Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is \nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy.  The [PBPD] Chief was \nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”\n299\n  Acosta responded that he would set up a \ncall on September 26, 2007, to talk “about who we can tell and how much.”\n300\n   \n  Also  on  September  24,  2007,  Villafaña  emailed  the  new  West  Palm  Beach  manager  to  \ninform  him  that  once  the  attorney  representative  was  appointed  for  the  victims,  she  planned  to  \n“meet with the girls myself to explain how the system [for obtaining relief under 18 U.S.C. § 2255] \nwill work.”  Villafaña also emailed Lefkowitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what \nI  can  tell  [the  attorney  representative]  and  the  girls  about  the  agreement,”  and  she  assured  \nLefkowitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.”  Villafaña \nalso provided Lefkowitz with a list of potential candidates for the attorney representative position \nand advocated for an attorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the matter. \n On September 26, 2007, Villafaña emailed Lefkowitz to request guidance on informing the \nvictims about the NPA:  “Can you give me a call . . . I am meeting with the agents and want to \ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.”  Villafaña told OPR that \nbecause  the  government  and  the  defense  had  not  agreed  on  the  attorney  representative  for  the  \nvictims,  she  reached  out  to  the  defense  at  the  direction  of  either  Acosta  or  Sloman  in  order  to  \ncoordinate how to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would \nbe an attorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR \nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be \n                                                 \n297\n  Villafaña had assured Lefkowitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would \nremain part of our case file.  It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would \ndistribute without compulsory process.”   \n298\n  Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have \nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOIA’d.”   \n299\n  Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefitted the victims were there for the victims \nto take advantage of. . . . and they did.  How . . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going \nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”   \n300\n  OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place. \n\n \n208 \n \ninvolved in such notifications.  According to Villafaña, Sloman then directed her to have the case \nagents make the victim notifications. \n Accordingly, Villafaña directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them \nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”  \nThe    case    agent    told    OPR,    “[T]here    was    a    discussion    that    Marie    and    I    had    as        \nto . . . how we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but \nit was the terms of the agreement.”  Villafaña believed that if “victims were properly notified of \nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein], \nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.”  Villafaña \n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court \nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first \nvictims  were  notified  [by  the  FBI].”    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  it  was  her  belief  that  because  the  \nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the \ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what \nthe agreement was about.”  Villafaña told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a \nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.       \n                                    \n Within a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had \nreached   a   deal   to   resolve   the   Epstein   case.      For   example,   on   October   1,   2007,   the      \nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes \nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months,” and noted that \nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into \npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”\n301\n     \n The case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and \n“we would not be pursuing this federally.”  In October 2007, for example, the case agents met with \nvictim  Courtney  Wild,  “to  advise  her  of  the  main  terms  of  the  Non-Prosecution  Agreement.”    \nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had \nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be \na federal prosecution.”\n302\n  However, in a declaration filed in 2015 in the CVRA litigation, Wild \ndescribed the conversation differently: \n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State \ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other \nvictims.  I  knew  that  State  charges  had  nothing  to  do  with  me.    \n                                                 \n301\n  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” New  York  \nPost, Oct. 1, 2007.

The following month, the Palm Beach Post reported the end \nof the federal investigation as well.  See “Epstein Has One Less Worry These Days,” Palm Beach Post, Nov. 9, 2007; \n“How Will System Judge Palm Beach Predator?,” Palm Beach Post “Opinion,” Nov. 16, 2007.  \n302\n  The co-case agent recalled meeting with the victims about the resolution of the case, but could not recall the \nspecifics of the discussions.   \n\n \n209 \n \nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement \nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein \nfor federal charges against me.  I did not get the opportunity to meet \nor confer with the prosecuting attorneys about any potential federal \ndeal that related to me or the crimes committed against me. \nMy  understanding  of  the  agents’  explanation  was  that  the  federal  \ninvestigation would continue.  I also understood that my own case \nwould move forward towards prosecution of Epstein. \nIn  addition,  the  case  agent  spoke  to  two  other  victims  and  relayed  their  reactions  to  \nVillafaña in an email: \nJane Doe #14 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic] \njail  sentence  and  Jane  Doe  #13  has  asked  for  our  Victim  Witness  \ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much \nneeded  [p]rofessional  counseling.    Other  than  that,  their  response  \nwas  filled  with  emotion  and  grateful  to  the  Federal  authorities  for  \npursuing justice and not giving up.\n303\n     \nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and \nexpressed “a sense of relief.”  Counsel for “Jane Doe #13” told OPR that while his client recalled \nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about \nEpstein’s guilty plea.  In a letter to OPR, “Jane Doe #14’s” attorney stated that although her client \nrecalled  speaking  with  an  FBI  agent,  she  was  not  told  about  the  NPA  or  informed  that  Epstein  \nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.   \nAfter  meeting  with  these  three  victims,  the  FBI  case  agent  became  concerned  that,  if  \nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’ \nknowledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.\n304\n  The \ncase  agent  explained  to  OPR  that  she  became  “uncomfortable”  talking  to  the  victims  about  the  \ndamages  provision,  and  that  as  the  lead  investigator,  “if  we  did  end  up  going  to  trial  .  .  .  [if]  \nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these \ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think \nit was right.” \nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafaña] \nand said we’re not comfortable now putting this out there . . . because . . . it’s likely that [the case \nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”  \nVillafaña told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe \n                                                 \n303\n    The  case  agent  did  not  record  any  of  the  victim  notifications  in  interview  reports,  because  “it  wasn’t  an  \ninterview  of  them,  it  was  a  notification.  .  .  .  [I]f  there  was  something  .  .  .  relevant  [that]  came  up  pertaining  to  the  \ninvestigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”   \n304\n  Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may attack the credibility of a witness \nthrough evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from \nthe government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.   \n\n \n210 \n \nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafaña or the case \nagents removed from the case.   \nBoth the lead case agent and Villafaña told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafaña \nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of \na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for \nadvice.      Villafaña   recalled   that   during   a   brief   telephone   consultation,   the   Professional   \nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if \nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”\n305\n  In her 2017 CVRA \ndeclaration,  the  case  agent  stated  that  after  conferring  with  the  USAO,  the  case  agents  stopped  \nnotifying victims about the NPA.   \nB. October 2007:  Defense Attorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications  \n While the case agents and Villafaña considered the impact that notifying the victims about \nthe  resolution  of  the  case  might  have  on  a  potential  trial,  defense  counsel  also  raised  concerns  \nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA.  As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA \nwas  signed  on  September  24,  2007,  the  USAO  proposed  using  a  special  master  to  select  the  \nattorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.  \nOn  October  5,  2007,  when  defense  attorney  Lefkowitz  sent  Villafaña  a  letter  responding  to  the  \nUSAO’s  proposal  to  use  a  special  master,  he  cautioned  that  “neither  federal  agents  nor  anyone  \nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the \ncase”  because  such  communications  would  “violate  the  confidentiality  of  the  agreement”  and  \nwould  prevent  Epstein  from  having  control  over  “what  is  communicated  to  the  identified  \nindividuals at this most critical stage.”  Lefkowitz followed this communication with an October \n10, 2007 letter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should \ncontact  the  identified  individuals  to  inform  them  of  the  resolution  of  the  case.”\n306\n  Rather, \nLefkowitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified \nindividuals.” \n  On October 23, 2007, Villafaña raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating: \nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome \nof  the  case  and  to  advise  them  that  an  attorney  will  be  contacting  \nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein.  If we don’t do \nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected \nattorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.   \nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2007, Lefkowitz sent Acosta \na letter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 20, 2007, \n                                                 \n305\n  The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about \nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein matter before the CVRA litigation was instituted \nin July 2008 and he was assigned to handle the litigation.  Villafaña told OPR that they consulted the Professional \nResponsibility  Officer  over  the  telephone,  the  call  took  no  more  than  “five  minutes,”  and  the\n Professional \nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”   \n306\n  Lefkowitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.  \n\n \n211 \n \nand  thanking  Acosta  for  agreeing  on  October  12,  2007,  not  to  “contact  any  of  the  identified  \nindividuals,  potential  witnesses,  or  potential  civil  claimants  and  their  respective  counsel  in  this  \nmatter.”\n307\n    Shortly  thereafter,  Sloman  drafted  a  response  to  Lefkowitz’s  letter,  which  Acosta  \nrevised  to  clarify  the  “inaccurate”  representations  made  by  Lefkowitz,  in  particular  noting  that  \nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact.  The draft response, as revised \nby Acosta, stated:   \nYou    should    understand,    however,    that    there    are    some    \ncommunications that are typical in these matters.  As an example, \nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them \nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing] \nthem.  Rest assured that we will continue to treat this matter as we \nwould any similarly situated case.\n308\n \n In a November 5, 2007 letter, Sloman complained to Lefkowitz that private investigators \nworking  for  Epstein  had  been  contacting  victims  and  asking  whether  government  agents  had  \ndiscussed financial settlement with them.  Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are \ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of \nthe matter, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed \nto pay damages in some circumstances.”  The same day, Villafaña emailed Sloman expressing her \nconcern that “if we [file charges] now, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told \nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”\n309\n   \nC. October – November 2007:  The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate, \nand  the  FBI  Sends  a  Notice  Letter  to  One  Victim  Stating  That  the  Case  is  \n“Under Investigation” \n Although Villafaña and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the \nNPA,  the  FBI  continued  its  investigation  of  the  case,  which  included  locating  and  interviewing  \npotential victims.  In October and November 2007, the FBI interviewed 12 potential new victims, \n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the \n                                                 \n307\n    Villafaña  later  emailed  Sloman  stating  that  she  planned  to  meet  with  the  case  agents  to  have  a  “general  \ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”    \n308\n  Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO \nwould not accept a “gag order.”  OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find \nany evidence that the draft letter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.  \n309\n  Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that \nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty.  In August \n2008, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafaña, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding \nthat  the  “victims  were  not  consulted  [concerning  the  NPA]  .  .  .  because  [the  USAO]  did  not  believe  the  [CVRA]  \napplied.”  Acosta responded:  “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as \npotential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to \ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”   \n\n \n212 \n \nNPA.\n310\n    The  FBI  reports  of  the  victim  interviews  do  not  mention  the  NPA  or  indicate  that  the  \nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case.  Villafaña acknowledged \nthat  she  and  the  case  agents  did  not  tell  any  of  the  “new”  post-NPA-signing  victims  about  the  \nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and \nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”  \n On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice letter to a victim \nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier.  This letter was identical to the VNS form notice \nletter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the \ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.”  The letter listed the eight \nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision.  Villafaña told OPR she \nwas unaware the FBI sent the letter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had \nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.”  In response to OPR’s questions about the \naccuracy of the FBI letter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafaña told \nOPR  that  the  NPA  required  Epstein  to  enter  a  plea  by  October  26,  2008,  and  “at  this  point  we  \nweren’t  actively  looking  for  additional  charges,”  but  “the  investigation  wasn’t  technically  \nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.” \nD. The  USAO  Informs  the  Defense  That  It  Intends  to  Notify  Victims  by  Letter  \nabout  Epstein’s  State  Plea  Hearing  and  the  Resolution  of  the  Federal  \nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan \n In anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafaña reported on November 16, 2007, to \nAcosta,  Sloman,  and  other  supervisors  that  she  had  learned,  from  FBI  agents  who  met  with  \nAssistant State Attorney Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify \nvictims of the state plea hearing. \n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.  The \nState  does  not  have  a  procedure  (like  we  do  federally)  where  the  \nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend \njudicial  proceedings,  so  I  do  not  know  how  many  victims  will  \nactually want to be present.\n311\n \nBelohlavek  told  OPR  that  she  did  not  recall  the  conversation  referenced  by  the  FBI  nor  any  \ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s \nstate plea hearing. \n \n On November 19, 2007, Villafaña decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from \nthe  defense  about  the  information  given  to  victims,  she  “would  put  the  victim  notification  in  \nwriting.”  She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification letter, in which among other things, \n                                                 \n310\n  Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list.  For example, one would not \ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third \nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.   \n311\n  Villafaña told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or \ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”   \n\n \n213 \n \nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s \nagreement  to  plead  guilty  to  state  charges  and  serve  18  months  in  county  jail,  and  the  victims’  \nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein.  The letter also would invite victims to appear \nat  the  state  court  hearing  and  make  a  statement  under  oath  or  provide  a  written  statement  to  be  \nfiled by the State Attorney’s Office.  Sloman and Villafaña exchanged edits on the draft victim \nnotification  letter,  and  Villafaña  also  informed  Sloman  that  “[t]here  are  a  few  girls  who  didn’t  \nreceive  the  original  letters,  so  I  will  need  to  modify  the  introductory  portion  of  the  letter  for  \nthose.”\n312\n   \nSloman  informed  Lefkowitz  of  the  government’s  need  to  meet  its  “statutory  obligation  \n(Justice  for  All  Act  of  2004)  to  notify  the  victims  of  the  anticipated  upcoming  events  and  their  \nrights  associated  with  the  agreement”  and  his  intent  to  “notify  the  victims  by  letter  after  COB  \nThursday, November 29.”  Lefkowitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that \nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2004.  He \nargued  that  the  defense  “should  have  a  right  to  review  and  make  objections  to  that  submission  \nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.”  He also insisted that if any notification letters were \nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein \nhas entered his plea” and that the letter should come from the attorney representative rather than \nthe government.  On November 28, 2007, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafaña provided Lefkowitz \nwith the draft victim notification letter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was \nto occur on December 14, 2007.\n313\n  \nIn a November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz strongly objected to the proposed draft \nnotification letter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any letter to victims until \nafter  Epstein’s  plea  and  sentencing.    Lefkowitz  also  contended  that  the  victims  had  no  right  to  \nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a written statement for such a \nproceeding.    In  a  November  30,  2007  reply  letter  to  Lefkowitz,  Acosta  did  not  address  the  \nsubstance  of  Lefkowitz’s  arguments,  but  accused  the  defense  team  of  “in  essence  presenting  \ncollateral  challenges”  delaying  effectuation  of  the  NPA,  and  asserted  that  if  Epstein  was  \ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial.  Shortly \nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter that he had directed prosecutors “not to \nissue victim notification letters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time \nto review these options with your client.”  In the letter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that \nVillafaña had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary \ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during \nthe investigation phase of this matter.” \n On December 5, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman \nand Assistant Attorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with \n                                                 \n312\n  On November 28, 2007, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafaña that \nonly  15  of  the  then-known  victims  had  received  victim  notification  letters  from  either  the  FBI  or  the  USAO.    On  \nDecember  6,  2007,  the  lead  case  agent  reported  to  Villafaña  that  she  was  “still  holding  many  of  the  original  V/W  \nletters addressed to victims from the USAO.”     \n313\n    Villafaña  understood  the  state  prosecutors  had  set  the  December  14,  2007  date,  and  emailed  them  for  \nconfirmation,  stating,  “[I]f  the  matter  is  set  for  the  14th,  please  let  me  know  so  I  can  include  that  in  my  victim  \nnotifications.”   \n\n \n214 \n \nthe  USAO’s  interpretation  of  the  agreement  and  “the  use  of  Section  2255.”    The  Starr  and  \nLefkowitz letter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim \nnotification  letter  “under  any  circumstances,”  and  “strongly  urg[ed]”  Acosta  to  withhold  the  \nnotification letter until after the defense was able “to discuss this matter with Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Fisher.”  \n The following day, Sloman sent a letter to Lefkowitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafaña, \nasserting  that  the  VRRA  obligated  the  government  to  notify  victims  of  the  18  U.S.C.  §  2255  \nproceedings  as  “other  relief”  to  which  they  were  entitled.    Sloman  also  stated  that  the  VRRA  \nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which \nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing \nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.\n314\n  (Emphasis in original).  Sloman added: \nJust  as  in  18  U.S.C.  §  3771  [the  CVRA],  these  sections  are  not  \nlimited  to  proceedings  in  a  federal district  court.    Our  Non-\nProsecution   Agreement   resolves   the   federal   investigation   by   \nallowing  Mr.  Epstein  to  plead  to  a  state  offense.    The  victims  \nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately \ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the \nU.S. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.\n315\n \nSloman  also  addressed  the  defense  objection  to  advising  the  victims  to  contact  Villafaña  or  the  \nFBI  case  agent  with  questions  or  concerns:    “Again,  federal  law  requires  that  victims  have  the  \n‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”  Sloman advised \nthe defense:  “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed \nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation.  Those questions are appropriately directed to \nlaw enforcement.” \nAlong with this letter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkowitz for comment a revised draft victim \nnotification  letter  that  was  substantially  similar  to  the  prior  draft  provided  to  the  defense.    The  \nletter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would \nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of imprisonment at sentencing, \nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The \nletter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing: \nAs  I  mentioned  above,  as  part  of  the  resolution  of  the  federal  \ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.  \nMr.   Epstein’s   change   of   plea   and   sentencing   will   occur   on   \nDecember 14, 2007, at ___ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley, \n                                                 \n314\n  See 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(1)(B) and (c)(3). \n315\n  Emphasis in original.  Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is \nsimply informing the victims of their rights.”  Villafaña informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the letter, \nbut  she  was  the  primary  author  of  the  document.    OPR  notes  that  Villafaña  was  the  principal  author  of  most  \ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that following the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the letter went \nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three attorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence \nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.     \n\n \n215 \n \nin Courtroom 11F at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 205 North \nDixie  Highway,  West  Palm  Beach,  Florida.    Pursuant  to  Florida  \nStatutes Sections 960.001(1)(k) and 921.143(1), you are entitled to \nbe present and to make a statement under oath.  If you choose, you \ncan  submit  a  written  statement  under  oath,  which  may  be  filed  by  \nthe State Attorney’s Office on your behalf.  If you elect to prepare a \nwritten statement, it should address the following:   \nthe  facts  of  the  case  and  the  extent  of  any  harm,  including  \nsocial, psychological, or physical harm, financial losses, loss \nof earnings directly or indirectly resulting from the crime for \nwhich  the  defendant  is  being  sentenced,  and  any  matter  \nrelevant  to  an  appropriate  disposition  and  sentence.    Fl[a].  \nStat. [§] 921.143(2).    \nSloman  told  OPR  that  he  was  “proceeding  under  the  belief  that  we  were  going  to  notify  [the  \nvictims], even though it wasn’t a federal case.  Whether we were required or not.”  Sloman also \ntold OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification \nletters . . . I think . . . Marie and . . . the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some \nlevel.” \n  On December 7, 2007, Villafaña prepared letters containing the above information to be \nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.\n316\n  \nSloman, however, had that day received a letter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing \nwas scheduled for January 4, 2008, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim \nnotification letters until “we can further discuss the contents.”  Also that day, Starr and Lefkowitz \nsubmitted  to  Acosta  the  two  lengthy  “independent  ethics  opinions”  supporting  the  defense  \narguments  against  the  federal  investigation  and  the  NPA’s  use  of  18  U.S.C.  §  2255.    Sloman  \nresponded to Villafaña’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the letter.”\n317\n  Sloman told \nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] letter out,” but his instruction to Villafaña \nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.  \nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO \n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then \nthe  victims  would  be  instantly  impeached  by  the  provision  that  you’re  entitled  to  monetary  \ncompensation.” \n On December 10, 2007, Villafaña contacted the attorney who at the time represented the \nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing \nvictim notification letters.”  In her 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña noted \nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered \n                                                 \n316\n  The FBI case agent had emailed Villafaña the day before stating, “The letter that is currently being revised \nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.”  The case agent also \nstated,  “I  do  not  feel  that  [the  defense]  should  have  anything  to  do  with  the  drafting  or  issuing  of  this  letter.    My  \nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”    \n317\n  Villafaña told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the letters; rather, \nshe “just remember[ed] putting them all in the Redweld and putting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”   \n\n \n216 \n \nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she \nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”\n318\n \nE. December 19, 2007:  Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to \nthe  State  Attorney  the  Decision  Whether  to  Notify  Victims  of  the  State  Plea  \nHearing,  but  the  USAO  Would  Notify  Them  of  the  Federal  Resolution,  “as  \nRequired by Law”  \n On December 11, 2007, Starr transmitted to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by \nLefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of \nthe investigation” into Epstein.  Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmittal \nletter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims \nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not \nbeing served.”  By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately \nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it \nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a \nvictim.”   \n  In  his  submissions,  Lefkowitz  argued  that  the  government  was  not  required  to  notify  \nvictims of the § 2255 provision: \n \nVillafaña’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of \na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification \nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2004, a federal law that \nrequires  federal  authorities  to  notify  victims  as  to  any  available  \nrestitution,  not  of  any  potential  civil  remedies.    Despite  this  fact,  \n[she] proposed a Victims Notification letter to be sent to the alleged \nfederal victims.   \n  Lefkowitz  also  argued  that  a  victim  trust  fund  would  provide  a  more  appropriate  \nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255, \nand  a  trust  fund  would  not  violate  Epstein’s  due  process  rights.    Lefkowitz  took  issue  with  the  \ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification letter to the \nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so.  Lefkowitz further argued \nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a \npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.     \n  In  a  letter  from  Villafaña  to  Lefkowitz,  responding  to  his  allegations  that  she  had  \ncommitted misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had \n                                                 \n318\n  As noted previously, in April 2007, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable \nto Epstein.  Villafaña told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a \nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal \ncharging document.  Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately \nfurnished to the defense.  The attorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by \nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.  \n\n \n217 \n \ninformed  victims  “of  their  right  to  collect  damages  prior  to  a  thorough  investigation  of  their  \nallegations against Mr. Epstein”: \nNone  of  the  victims  were  informed  of  the  right  to  sue  under  \nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.  Three victims \nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general \nterms  of  that  Agreement.    You  raised  objections  to  any  victim  \nnotification,  and  no  further  notifications  were  done.    Throughout  \nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though \nit would proceed to trial.  Notifying the witnesses of the possibility \nof  damages  claims  prior  to  concluding  the  matter  by  plea  or  trial  \nwould only undermine my case.  If my reassurances are insufficient \nthe  fact  that  not  a  single  victim  has  threatened  to  sue  Mr.  Epstein  \nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation. \n On December 14, 2007, Villafaña forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification letter \npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft letters addressed to State Attorney Krischer; \nVillafaña’s transmittal email to Acosta had the subject line, “The letters you requested.”  One of \nthe draft letters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafaña, was to advise that the USAO had sent an \nenclosed victim notification letter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list \nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them \nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n319\n  The second draft letter \nto  Krischer,  for  Acosta’s  signature,  requested  that  Krischer  respond  to  defense  counsel’s  \nallegations  that  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  was  not  comfortable  with  the  proposed  plea  and  \nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender \nregistration.  OPR found no evidence that these letters were sent to Krischer.\n320\n   \n A few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafaña \nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?”  Villafaña told \nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA] \nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in \nan unrelated matter].  We seem to be in a Catch 22.”\n321\n  OPR did not find a response to Villafaña’s \nemail.  \n In their December 14, 2007 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their \nlengthy follow-up letter to Acosta on December 17, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz continued to press \ntheir  objections  to  the  USAO’s  involvement  in  the  Epstein  matter.    They  requested  that  Acosta  \n                                                 \n319\n  The draft victim notification letter was identical to the draft victim notification letter sent to the defense on \nDecember 6, 2007, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2008.   \n320\n  Moreover, the letters were not included in the publicly released State Attorney’s file, which included other \ncorrespondence from the USAO.  See Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available \nat http://sa15.org/stateattorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm. \n321\n    OPR  was  unable  to  locate  any  records  indicating  that  such  allegations  had  ever  been  referred  to  OPR.    \nVillafaña told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on” \nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”   \n\n \n218 \n \nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly \nexpansive interpretation” of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.   \nIn  a  December  19,  2007  response  to  the  defense  team,  Acosta  offered  to  revise  two  \nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties \nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they \nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.”  Acosta also advised \nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation, \nthe USAO would leave to the State Attorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state \nproceedings:  \nI  understand  that  the  defense  objects  to  the  victims  being  given  \nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing \nhearing.  I have reviewed the proposed victim notification letter and \nthe statute.  I would note that the United States provided the draft \nletter to the defense as a courtesy.  In addition, First Assistant United \nStates  Attorney  Sloman  already  incorporated  in  the  letter  several  \nedits that had been requested by defense counsel.  I agree that [the \nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations \nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We intend to provide \nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law.  We \nwill defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding whether \nhe  wishes  to  provide  victims  with  notice  of  the  state  proceedings,  \nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do \nso if he wishes.   \n Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this letter without running it by [Sloman], if \nnot  other  individuals  in  the  office,”  and  records  show  he  sent  a  draft  to  Sloman  and  Villafaña.    \nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of \nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the \nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state \noutcome.”\n322\n  Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the \nState  Attorney’s  Office’s  handling  of  the  Epstein  case,  he  did  not  believe  it  was  appropriate  to  \nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not  \nassume . . . that the State Attorney’s Office is full of bad actors.”  Acosta told OPR that it was his \nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have \nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”  Acosta also told OPR that the state would \n                                                 \n322\n  Sloman’s handwritten notes from a December 21, 2007 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the \ndefense,  “Are  there  concerns  re:  3771  lang[uage],”  to  which  Lefkowitz  replied,  “The  state  should  have  their  own  \nmechanism.”  At the time of the Epstein matter, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded \nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.  Fla. \nConst. art. I, § 16(b)(6).  Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims \nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the \nvictim[.]”  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(a) (2007).  Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or written impact statement.  \nFla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(k) (2007).  Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family \nof the victim must be consulted by the state attorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the \ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.  Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(g) (2007).        \n\n \n219 \n \nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence \nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”   \nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state \ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”\n323\n  Mandelker, however, had no memory of advising \nAcosta  to  defer  the  decision  to  make  notifications  to  the  State  Attorney,  and  she  noted  that  the  \n“correspondence  [OPR]  provided  to  me  from  that  time  period”  discussing  such  a  decision  \n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that \nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.”  Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that \n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights \nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were \ngoing to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide how the victims were going \nto be notified.”   \n Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim \nlist from the USAO.  She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard \nto contacting the victims. \n In response to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter, Lefkowitz asserted that the FBI should \nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be \nheard at the sentencing hearing:  \n[Y]our  letter  also  suggests  that  our  objection  to  your  Office’s  \nproposed  victims  notification  letter  was  that  the  women  identified  \nas  victims  of  federal  crimes  should  not  be  notified  of  the  state  \nproceedings.  That is not true, as our previous letter clearly states.  \nPutting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom \n[CVRA]  notification  letters  are  intended  are  in  fact  not  victims  as  \ndefined    in    the    Attorney    General’s    2000    Victim    Witness    \nGuidelines—a  status  requiring  physical,  emotional  or  pecuniary  \ninjury  of  the  [victim]—it  was  and  remains  our  position  that  these  \nwomen  may  be  notified  of  such  proceedings  but  since  they  are  \nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this matter, \nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make \nsworn written or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein \nat  such  proceedings,  as  Ms.  Villafaña  repeatedly  maintained  they  \nhad the right to do.  Additionally, it was and remains our position \nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts \nby  the  FBI  to  have  communications  with  the  witnesses  after  the  \nexecution  of  the  Agreement  should  finally  come  to  an  end.    We  \nagree,   however,   with   your   December   19   modification   of   the   \npreviously  drafted  federal  notification  letter  and  agree  that  the  \n                                                 \n323\n  In his June 3, 2008 letter to Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted \nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the following proposal [to defer notification to the State Attorney’s \nOffice].”  OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision. \n\n \n220 \n \ndecision  as  to  who  can  be  heard  at  a  state  sentencing  is,  amongst  \nmany  other  issues,  properly  within  the  aegis  of  state  decision  \nmaking.\n324\n \nFollowing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, in which Acosta asked that the \ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications \nto the victims, Lefkowitz responded with a December 26, 2007 letter to Acosta, objecting again to \nnotification of the victims.  Lefkowitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because \nthe  Attorney  General  Guidelines  defined  “crime  victim”  as  a  person  harmed  as  a  result  of  an  \noffense  charged  in  federal  district  court,  and  Epstein  had  not  been  charged  in  federal  court.    \nNevertheless, Lefkowitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not \nobject (as we made clear in our letter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged \nvictims.”  Lefkowitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice \nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses \nshould  be  sent  by  the  State  Attorney  rather  than  [the  USAO],”  and  he  agreed  that  the  USAO  \n“should  defer  to  the  discretion  of  the  State  Attorney  regarding  all  matters  with  regard  to  those  \nvictims and the state proceedings.”   \n Months later, in April 2008, Epstein’s attorneys complained in a letter to Mandelker that \nSloman  and  Villafaña  committed  professional  misconduct  by  threatening  to  send  a  “highly  \nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” victims.  \n \nF. January – June 2008:  While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department \nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating \nEpstein \nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through \nthe  end  of  June  2008,  the  defense  employed  various  measures  to  delay,  or  avoid  entirely,  \nimplementation  of  the  NPA.    Ultimately,  defense  counsel’s  advocacy  resulted  in  the  USAO’s  \ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh.  A review of the evidence was undertaken first \nby  USAO  Criminal  Chief  Robert  Senior  and  then,  briefly,  by  an  experienced  CEOS  trial  \nattorney.  A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS \nChief Oosterbaan, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal \nMandelker  and  Assistant  Attorney  General  Alice  Fisher,  and  then  by  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  \nAttorney General.  Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.   \nAs  set  forth  below,  during  that  time,  Villafaña  and  the  FBI  continued  investigating  and  \nworking toward potential federal charges.  \n1. Villafaña  Prepares  to  Contact  Victims  in  Anticipation  That  Epstein  \nWill Breach the NPA  \n On January 3, 2008, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state \ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2008, at which time he \nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea, \n                                                 \n324\n  The 2000 Guidelines were superseded by the 2005 Guidelines.   \n\n \n221 \n \n“federal  authorities  are  expected  to  drop  their  probe  into  whether  Epstein  broke  any  federal  \nlaws.”\n325\n   \n Nevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that \nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and \nwith his attorneys asserting that “the facts had gotten better for Epstein,” Villafaña came to believe \nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.\n326\n  In January 2008, Villafaña informed her supervisors \nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared \nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with \nthe vast majority of the victims.”  Villafaña then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with \nall the victims so that we know we can rely on them at trial.”\n327\n  Villafaña told OPR that at this \npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or \nsend any victim notification letters—there simply was nothing to update.  I did not receive any \nvictim calls during this time.” \n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Letters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims \n On January 10, 2008, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification \nletters  to  14  victims  articulating  the  eight  CVRA  rights  and  inviting  recipients  to  update  their  \ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the matter.\n328\n  The \ncase agent informed Villafaña in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI] \nletter to all the remaining identified victims.”  These 2008 letters were identical to the FBI form \nletters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2006, and October 12, 2007.  \nLike those previous letters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24, \n2007, the 2008 letters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his \ncan  be  a  lengthy  process  and  we  request  your  continued  patience  while  we  conduct  a  thorough  \ninvestigation.”  The letters also stated: \n                                                 \n325\n    Michele  Dargan,  “Jeffrey  Epstein  Plea  Hearing  Moved  to  March,”  Palm  Beach  Daily  News  “The  Shiny  \nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2008.  \n326\n  Epstein’s attorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned \nunflattering  details  or  potential  impeachment  information  concerning  likely  federal  victims,  they  argued  for  the  \nexclusion of those victims from the federal case.  For example, defense attorneys questioned one victim as to whether \nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.  See Exhibit 9 to \nVillafaña June 2, 2017 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2006-CF-9454, at 44, \n50, 51 (Feb. 20, 2008).  One victim’s attorney told OPR that the defense attorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking \nhighly  personal  sexual  questions  about  “terminations  of  pregnancies  .  .  .  sexual  encounters  .  .  .  masturbation.”    \nEpstein’s attorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client.  For example, \nthe Miami  Herald  reported  that,  “One  girl  was  asked  about  her  abortions,  and  her  parents,  who  were  Catholic  and  \nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.”  See Julie Brown, “Perversion of Justice: Cops \nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.  Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami  Herald, Nov. 28, \n2018.  \n327\n  Villafaña also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.  \n328\n  The Victim Specialist later generated an additional letter dated May 30, 2008.  After Epstein’s June 30, 2008 \nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification letters to two victims who resided outside of the United \nStates.  \n\n \n222 \n \nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights \ndescribed.  Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the \narrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become \nthe responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office \nto  ensure  you  are  accorded  those  rights.    You  may  also  seek  the  \nadvice of a private attorney with respect to these rights.   \nThe FBI case agent informed Villafaña that the Victim Specialist sent the letters and would follow \nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their letter.”   \nA sample letter is shown on the following pages.   \nVillafaña told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the letters at the time \nthey  were  sent  to  the  victims,  or  reviewing  the  letters  until  they  were  collected  for  the  CVRA  \nlitigation,  sometime  after  July  2008.    Rather,  according  to  Villafaña,  “The  decision  to  issue  the  \nletter and the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.”  Nevertheless, Villafaña \nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was \nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in \nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.”  Villafaña identified \nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2007 until the end of June \n2008,”  such  as  collecting  and  reviewing  evidence;  interviewing  new  victims;  re-interviewing  \nvictims;  identifying  new  charges;  developing  new  charging  strategies;  drafting  supplemental  \nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges.  Similarly, \nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and \nthe investigation was continuing.”  The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s \nnever been shut down.” \nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January 10, 2008 FBI letters; much later, in the \ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this letter was that [her] case \nwas  still  being  investigated  and  the  FBI  and  prosecutors  were  moving  forward  on  the  Federal  \nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”\n329\n  \n                                                 \n329\n  CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January 10, 2008 FBI letter that was sent to her counsel.  \n\n223\nJan1Jary 10, 2008 \nRe: case Number. \nDear \nu.s .

The attorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the \nmatter,”  but  Sloman  declined  to  answer  his  questions  concerning  the  investigation.\n332\n    In  late  \nJanuary, the New York Postreported that the attorney’s clients had filed a $50 million civil suit \nagainst  Epstein  in  Florida  and  that  “Epstein  is  expected  to  be  sentenced  to  18  months  in  prison  \nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”\n333\n  \nBetween January 31, 2008, and May 28, 2008, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed \nadditional  victims  and  reinterviewed  several  who  had  been  interviewed  before  the  NPA  was  \nsigned.\n334\n  In late January 2008, as Villafaña and the CEOS Trial Attorney prepared to participate \n330\nThe  case  agent  also  informed  Villafaña  that  she  expected  to  ask  for  legal  process  soon  in  order  to  obtain  \nadditional information. \n331\nThe CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare \nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”   \n332\nBecause  Sloman  and  the  attorney  were  former  legal  practice  partners,  Sloman  reported  the  interaction  to  \nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.   OPR reviewed the matter as an inquiry and \ndetermined that no further action was warranted.\n333\nDareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at 14 -$50M Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New York \nPost, Jan. 25, 2008. \n334\nAn FBI interview report from May 28, 2008, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted \nfor his actions.”   \nif you have addftiohal questions which Involve this matter, please contact the office listed above.

Prior  to  the  interview,  Wild  had  received  the  FBI’s  January  10,  2008  \nletter stating that the case was under investigation; however, according to the case agent, Wild and \ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2007, that the case had been resolved.  \nIn her 2015 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI letter, she believed \nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential \nresolution  of  the  federal  criminal  investigation  I  was  cooperating  in.    If  I  had  been  told  of  a[n  \nNPA], I would have objected.”  In Villafaña’s 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña \nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 31, 2008, along with FBI agents, and Villafaña told OPR \nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.”  Villafaña recalled \nWild  responding  that  she  “hoped  Epstein  would  be  prosecuted  and  that  she  was  willing  to  \ntestify.”\n335\n   \n \n After the first three victim interviews on January 31, 2008, Villafaña described for Acosta \nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims: \nOne girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview \ntwice . . . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming \nafter  her  and  she  started  to  break  down  again  so  we  stopped  the  \ninterview. \nThe second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had \nread about in the paper.\n336\n  She said that 18 months was nothing and \nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would \nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time \nin jail.\n337\n      \nVillafaña closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman attend the interviews with victims \nscheduled for the following day, but neither did so.\n338\n  Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical” \n                                                 \n335\n  The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.   \n336\n  See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at 14 - $50M Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New \nYork  Post,  Jan.  25,  2008.   As  early  as  October  2007,  the  New  York  Post  reported  the  18-month  sentence  and  that  \n“[t]he feds have agreed to drop their probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to \nthe new state charge.”  Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal – Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” \nNew York Post, Oct. 1, 2007. \n337\n  Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that \nthey don’t like it.”  The CEOS Trial Attorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested \nin this prosecution going forward.”  Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Attorney also opined that “[the \nvictims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an extensive amount of “victim management,” \nas the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”     \n338\n    OPR  located  FBI  interview  reports  relating  to  only  one  February  1,  2008  victim  interview.    Although  \nVillafaña’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, OPR \nlocated  no  corresponding  reports  for  those  victim  interviews.    OPR  located  undated  handwritten  notes  Villafaña  \n\n \n226 \n \nfor him, as U.S. Attorney, to attend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was \nquestioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.”  Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never \ngone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”    \n Villafaña told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had \nbeen notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafaña \ndid not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had \nthese terms.”  Villafaña also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want \nthere to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their \nclaims  or  completely  making  up  claims  in  order  to  increase  their  damages  amount.”    Rather,  \naccording  to  Villafaña,  she  told  the  three  victims  that  “an  agreement  had  been  reached  where  \n[Epstein]  was  going  to  be  entering  a  guilty  plea,  but  it  doesn’t  look  like  he  intends  to  actually  \nperform  .  .  .  [and]  now  it  looks  like  this  may  have  to  be  charged,  and  may  have  to  go  to  trial.”    \nVillafaña  recalled  “explaining that the case was under investigation,”  that  they  “were  preparing  \nthe case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.”  Villafaña \nrecalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it \nso low” and Villafaña answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”\n339\n   \nWith regard to the victims Villafaña interviewed who had not received an FBI notification \nin October 2007, Villafaña recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they \ndiscussed the agreement.  She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an \nagreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “pretty sure” that she did not mention the \nagreement  during  the  interview  of  the  third  victim.    Villafaña  explained  that  she  likely  did  not  \ndiscuss the agreement because  \nat that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent.  [The victim] didn’t \nknow anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was \ngoing to end up being thrown on the heap, and I didn’t want to -- . . . \nif you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admitted that he’s guilty, \nlike, I didn’t want that to color her statement.  I just wanted to get \nthe facts of the case. \nThe CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims \nabout the NPA or the status of the case.\n340\n  She did remember explaining the significance of the \nprosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein.  The FBI case \nagent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2008 interviews.  OPR located notes to an FBI \ninterview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted.  Attorneys \nfor the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the \nresolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2020, their clients had no memory of meeting with \n                                                 \nauthored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the \ninvestigation or the resolution of the case.  Through her attorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having \ncontact with anyone from the USAO.        \n339\n  Villafaña did not recall any other specific questions from victims.  \n340\n  The CEOS Trial Attorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were \ngenerally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.  \n\n \n227 \n \nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the \nplea was entered on June 30, 2008.   \n \n  When  asked  whether  she  was  concerned  that  her  statements  would  mislead  the  victims,  \nVillafaña told OPR: \nFrom  my  perspective  we  were  conducting  an  investigation  and  it  \nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment.  You \nknow,   I   was   interviewing   witnesses,   I   was   issuing   [legal   \nprocess], . . .    I  was  doing  all  [these]  things  to  take  the  case  to  a  \nfederal indictment and a federal trial.  So to me, saying to a victim \nthe case is now back under investigation is perfectly accurate. \n4. February – March 2008:  Villafaña Takes Additional Steps to Prepare \nfor  a  Prosecution  of  Epstein,  Arranges  for  Pro  Bono  Attorneys  for  \nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay \n  In  February  2008,  Villafaña  revised  the  prosecution  memorandum  and  supplemental  \nmemorandum.  Villafaña removed some victims known to Epstein from the PBPD investigation \nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly \ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.   \n  While the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of \nthe Department, Villafaña sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and \nattempting  to  subpoena  for  depositions  as  part  of  Epstein’s  defense  in  civil  lawsuits  that  some  \nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.  \nVillafaña reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service \norganization” to provide attorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some \nvictims to provide contact information for the attorneys.\n341\n  During this period, an attorney from \nthe  victims  service  organization  was  able  to  help  Courtney  Wild  avoid  an  improper  deposition.    \nVillafaña also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit \nsuicide  last  week,”  and  advocated  aggressively  for  a  resolution  to  the  case:    “I  just  can’t  stress  \nenough how important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.  The ‘please be patient’ \nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the attack while we are \nforced to wait on the sidelines.” \n5. March – April 2008:  Villafaña Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal \nCharges \n Villafaña continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing \nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein.  Villafaña also prepared search warrants for digital \n                                                 \n341\n  The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafaña that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them \nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime \nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”   \n\n \n228 \n \ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted \nimages that could contain child pornography.\n342\n   \n  By  early  April  2008,  as  the  defense  pursued  its  appeal  to  the  Department’s  Criminal  \nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafaña and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein \nwere  “more  and  more  likely.”    Villafaña  asked  Oosterbaan  for  help  to  “move  this  [Criminal  \nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s \ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents \nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”   \n On April 24, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior \nasking  whether  she  had  the  “green  light”  to  file  charges  and  raising  the  same  concerns  she  had  \nexpressed  to  Oosterbaan.    Villafaña  further  cautioned  that,  although  she  was  planning  to  file  \ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the \nagents, and the police officers to decide how the case will be resolved and to provide them with an \nexplanation  for  the  delay.”    Because  the  Department’s  Criminal  Division  did  not  conclude  its  \nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, however, Villafaña did not file charges that day.  \nVIII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED \nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION \nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA \nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict \nbetween  the  Department’s  position  that  CVRA’s  victims’  rights  attached  upon  the  filing  of  a  \ncriminal  charge  and  a  new  federal  appellate  ruling  to  the  contrary.    The  contemporaneous  \ncommunications confirm that in 2008, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy \nregarding the issue.   \n  \nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April 18, 2008, Acosta and Sloman received a \ncitizen complaint from an attorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the \nFlorida  Bar  had  violated  his  First  Amendment  rights.    The  attorney  asserted  that  the  CVRA  \nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was \nthe  victim  of  a  federal  crime.    Acosta  forwarded  the  message  to  the  USAO  Appellate  Division  \nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2005 Guidelines, “our obligations \nunder  [the  CVRA]  are  not  triggered  until  charges  are  filed.”    On  April  24,  2008,  the  Appellate  \nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her] \nreading  of  [the  2005  Guidelines]  is  correct  and  that  our  obligations  under  [the  CVRA]  are  not  \ntriggered until a case is filed.”\n343\n   \n \n On May 7, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s \n                                                 \n342\n  The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.  \n343\n    The  Appellate  Division  Chief  advised  Acosta  that  Acosta  could  inform  the  complainant  that,  prior  to  the  \ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations \nto the victim.   \n\n \n229 \n \nCVRA rights attach prior to the filing of criminal charges.\n344\n  The Appellate Division Chief noted \nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2005 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.” \n Dean  involved  a  federal  prosecution  arising  from  a  2005  explosion  at  an  oil  refinery  \noperated  by  BP  Products  North  America,  Inc.  (BP)  that  killed  15  people  and  injured  more  than  \n170.  Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without \nnotifying  the  victims.    The  government  filed  a  sealed  motion,  alerting  the  district  court  to  the  \npotential  plea  and  claiming  that  consultation  with  all  the  victims  was  impractical  and  that  such  \nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations.  The court \nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea \nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties.  Thereafter, the government filed a criminal \ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices \nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard.  One month later, 12 \nvictims  asked  the  court  to  reject  the  plea  because  it  was  entered  into  in  violation  of  their  rights  \nunder the CVRA.  The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to \nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s \ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.\n345\n  The district court noted that the \nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as \nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.   \n \n In denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court \n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”\n346\n  In particular, the Fifth Circuit \ncited  the  district  court’s  acknowledgement  that  “[t]here  are  clearly  rights  under  the  CVRA  that  \napply before any prosecution is underway.”  The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation \nwas  not  “an  infringement”  on  the  government’s  independent  prosecutorial  discretion,  but  “it  is  \nonly  a  requirement  that  the  government  confer  in  some  reasonable  way  with  the  victims  before  \nultimately  exercising  its  broad  discretion.”    In  the  wake  of  the  Dean  opinion,  two  Department  \ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning \nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution. \nIX. JUNE  2008:    VILLAFAÑA’S  PRE-PLEA  CONTACTS  WITH  THE  ATTORNEY  \nREPRESENTING    THE    VICTIMS    WHO    LATER    BECAME    THE    CVRA    \nPETITIONERS \nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her attorney, Bradley Edwards, \nWild retained Edwards in June 2008 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from \nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey \nEpstein.”\n347\n  Villafaña told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of \n                                                 \n344\n  In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008).  The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida, \nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.  \n345\n  United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2008 WL 501321, at *11 (S.D. Tex. 2008).  Victims who \nwished to be heard were permitted to speak at the plea hearing.   \n346\n  Dean, 527 F.3d at 394. \n347\n  Before Epstein’s state court plea hearing, Edwards also began representing the victim who became Jane Doe \n#2.  Although OPR focuses on Villafaña’s communications with Edwards in this section, OPR notes that Villafaña \n\n \n230 \n \nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of \nthe FBI case agents.  \n  Edwards  contacted  Villafaña  by  email  and  telephone  in  mid-June,  stating  that  he  had  \n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”\n348\n  In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that \nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafaña, he “asked very specific questions about what stage \nthe investigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because \nthe matter “was an on-going active investigation[.]”  Edwards attested that Villafaña gave him “the \nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, \nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”\n349\n   \nIn her written response to OPR, Villafaña said that she “listened more than [she] spoke” \nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea: \nGiven the uncertainty of the situation – Epstein was still challenging \nour  ability  to  prosecute  him  federally,  pressing  allegations  of  \nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate better plea terms, \nwhile  the  agents,  my  supervisors,  and  I  were  all  moving  towards  \n[filing charges] – I did not feel comfortable sharing any information \nabout the case.  It is also my practice not to talk about status before \nthe grand jury.   \nIn  her  2017  declaration  in  the  CVRA  litigation,  Villafaña  explained  that  during  these  \nexchanges, Villafaña did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not \nknow whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court \nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”\n350\n  Villafaña told OPR that she did not inform Edwards \n                                                 \nalso  had  interactions  with  other  victims’  attorneys.    For  example,  another  attorney  informed  OPR  that  he  spoke  to  \nVillafaña  two  to  five  times  concerning  the  status  of  the  case  and  each  time  was  told  that  the  case  was  under  \ninvestigation.  The attorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafaña].  We were never told what was \nhappening or going on to any extent.”  Villafaña’s counsel told OPR that Villafaña did not have any interaction with \nthe attorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her written communications \nresponding to the attorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible.  OPR found no documentation \nthat Villafaña’s communications with the attorney occurred prior to June 30, 2008.  Villafaña also had more ministerial \ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.  For example, in March \n2008, one victim’s attorney informed Villafaña of his representation of a victim and requested that the government \nprovide  him  with  photographs  of  the  victim  and  information  concerning  the  tail  registration  number  for  Epstein’s  \nairplane.  Villafaña responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep \nher updated about the civil litigation.    \n348\n    Villafaña  later  stated  in  a  July  9,  2008  declaration  filed  in  the  CVRA  litigation  that,  although  she  invited  \nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”  \n349\n  Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other \nattorneys who were representing victims.   \n350\n    The  government  later  admitted  in  court  filings  that  Villafaña  and  Edwards  “discussed  the  possibility  of  \nfederal  charges  being  filed  in  the  future  and  that  the  NPA  was  not  mentioned.”    Doe,  Government’s  Response  to  \nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nat 14, ¶101 (June 6, 2017).   \n\n \n231 \n \nabout the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and \nleading  towards”  the  filing  of  charges.    Villafaña  recalled  mentioning  the  conversation  to  her  \nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance \nto us and . . . could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and \nshould be prosecuted.”  \n  Nevertheless,  when  OPR  asked  Villafaña  why  she  did  not  inform  Edwards  of  the  same  \ninformation  that  the  FBI  and  she  had  provided  to  Wild  in  October  2007  and  January  2008,  \nVillafaña explained that she felt “prohibited”: \nAt the time that I spoke with him, you know, there had been all of \nthis . . . letter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I \nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose \nthings   further   and   not   to   have   any   involvement   in   victim   \nnotification,  and  so  I  felt  like  that  prohibited  me  from  telling  him  \nabout the existence of the NPA. \nX. JUNE 2008:  EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 30, 2008 PLEA \nHEARING \n The  Epstein  team’s  appeals  through  the  Department  ended  on  June  23,  2008,  when  the  \nDeputy  Attorney  General  determined  that  “federal  prosecution  of  this  case  is  appropriate”  and  \nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such \na  decision.    Immediately  thereafter,  at  Sloman’s  instruction,  Villafaña  notified  Lefkowitz  that  \nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to \nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.”  That same day, Villafaña made plans to file charges on July \n1, 2008, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 30 deadline. \nOn Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafaña received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement \nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on Monday, June 30, 2008.  Also on \nthat  Friday,  Villafaña  submitted  to  Sloman  and  Criminal  Division  Chief  Senior  a  “final  final”  \nproposed federal indictment of Epstein. \n Villafaña and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose, \nfor  §  2255  purposes,  to  Epstein  after  the  plea  and,  at  Sloman’s  instruction,  Villafaña  contacted  \nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing.  Villafaña told OPR that \nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the \nplea.”\n351\n  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief \nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”\n352\n  \n                                                 \n351\n    Villafaña  further  stated,  “I  requested  permission  to  make  oral  notifications  to  the  victims  regarding  the  \nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, \nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”        \n352\n  Sloman replied, “Good.”  \n\n \n232 \n \n Villafaña told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims, \nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.  Villafaña recalled \nthat Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy \nthe list afterwards.  Villafaña did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the \nState Attorney’s Office.” \n In his 2009 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafaña sent him a letter “around the time of \nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the \nletter after he reviewed it.  Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the \nstate  grand  jury’s  indictment  of  Epstein  did  not  include  all  of  the  victims  that  the  PBPD  had  \nidentified  and  he  “wanted  to  make  sure  that  some  prosecution  body  had  considered  all  of  our  \nvictims.”\n353\n \n  In  her  2017  declaration  in  the  CVRA  litigation,  Villafaña  stated  that  she  and  the  PBPD  \n“attempted to notify the victims about [the June 30] hearing in the short time available to us.”\n354\n  \nIn her 2008 declaration, however, Villafaña conceded that “all known victims were not notified.”    \n Villafaña  told  OPR  that  Edwards  was  the  only  victim  attorney  she  was  authorized  to  \ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 30, 2008 plea hearing because Edwards \n“had  expressed  a  specific  interest  in  the  outcome.”    Villafaña  recalled,  “I  was  told  that  I  could  \ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”\n355\n  In her 2008 \ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she called Edwards and informed him of \nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafaña stated that Edwards told her that he could not \nattend  the  hearing  but  “someone”  would  be  present.    In  a  later  filing  in  the  CVRA  litigation,  \nhowever, Edwards asserted that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state \nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of \nthe  federally-identified  victims.”\n356\n    Edwards  further  claimed  that  because  Villafaña  failed  to  \ninform  him  that  the  “guilty  pleas  in  state  court  would  bring  an  end  to  the  possibility  of  federal  \nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not attend the hearing.  Villafaña told \nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allow Edwards and his clients \nthe ability to comment on the resolution: \n                                                 \n353\n  Reiter showed the letter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the \nstate case were included on that.”  The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed \nit.”  The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter showed it to him.          \n354\n  The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”   \n355\n    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  she  thought  that  it  was  Sloman  who  gave  her  the  instructions,  but  she  could  not  \n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”  \n356\n  Villafaña stated that she “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and \nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a \nspecific  victim.”    Although  Edwards  criticized  Villafaña’s  conduct  in  his  CVRA  filings,  in  his  recently  published  \nbook, Edwards described Villafaña as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in \nthe victims and tr[ied] . . .  to bring down Jeffrey Epstein.”  Bradley J. Edwards with Brittany Henderson, Relentless \nPursuit at 380 (Gallery Books 2020). \n\n \n233 \n \n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that \nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer \nthat  was  read,  and  where  the  judge  would  ask  if  there  were  any  \nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad \nEdwards  wanted  to  address  the  court  or  if  his  clients  wanted  to  \naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.\n357\n \n \n Sloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafaña to contact anyone about the plea \nhearing  or  directing  her  specifically  not  to  contact  anyone  about  it.    Acosta  told  OPR  that  he  \nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal \ncase  “and  [the  victims  would]  have  an  opportunity  to  speak  up  at  the  state  court  hearing.”    \nNevertheless, Acosta did not know whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims \nor  whether  the  USAO  “shared  that  list  with  them.”    Villafaña  told  OPR  that  she  and  Acosta  \n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that \nthe state only believed they had one victim.”\n358\n  Villafaña told OPR that there was “very little” \ncommunication between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, and although she discussed a \nfactual proffer with the State Attorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had \nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they \nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n359\n \n Sloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results \nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.  He explained: \n \n[E]ven  though  we  didn’t  have  a  legal  obligation,  I  felt  that  the  \nvictims  were  going  to  be  notified  and  the  state  was  going  .  .  .  to  \nfulfill  that  obligation,  and  even  as  another  failsafe,  [the  victims]  \nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set \nup on their behalf.   \n \nSloman acknowledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO \nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,  \n \nit was [of] concern that this was going to break down and . . . result \nin  us  prosecuting  Epstein  and  that  the  victims  were  going  to  be  \nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, \nyou’re  going  to  get  $150,000,  that’s  .  .  .  going  to  be  instant  \nimpeachment for the defense.  \n                                                 \n357\n    Assistant  State  Attorney  Belohlavek  told  OPR  that  federal  victims  who  were  not  a  party  to  the  state  case  \nwould not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings.  Rather, such a \npresentation  would  have  required  coordination  between  the  USAO  and  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  and  additional  \ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Attorney’s Office.      \n358\n  In an email a few months earlier, Villafaña noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution] \nis related to two girls.  One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”    \n359\n  As noted in Chapter Two, Villafaña had stopped communicating with the State Attorney’s Office regarding \nthe state case following Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.   \n\n \n234 \n \nWhen  asked  why  the  USAO  did  not  simply  notify  the  victims  of  the  change  of  plea  hearing,  \nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense \nthat the victims were overly interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”   \n \n Also,  in  late  June,  Villafaña  drafted  a  victim  notification  letter  concerning  the  June  30,  \n2008 plea.\n360\n  Villafaña told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2007 that we \nwould not provide written notice of the state change of plea, the written victim notifications were \nprepared to be sent immediately following Epstein’s guilty plea.”\n361\n  As she did with prior draft \nvictim notification letters, Villafaña provided the draft to the defense for comments.\n362\n   \n Although Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to facilitate \nthe filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n \n \n  OPR  reviewed  voluminous  Epstein-related  files  that  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  made  \navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing \ndate, the state informed victims of the June 30, 2008 plea.  On March 12, 2008, the State Attorney’s \nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding \nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2008.  However, the Palm Beach \nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at] \ncollege.”       \n \nXI. JUNE  30,  2008:    EPSTEIN  ENTERS  HIS  GUILTY  PLEAS  IN  A  STATE  COURT  \nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT  \n On June 30, 2008, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his attorney \nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under 18 \nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution.  The \ninformation charged that between August 1, 2004, and October 9, 2005, Epstein “did knowingly \nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under \nthe age of 18 years,” and referred to no other victims.  The indictment did not identify any victims \nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August \n1,  2004,  and  October  31,  2005.    Although  the  charges  did  not  indicate  whether  they  applied  to  \nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed the court that \n“[t]here’s several” victims.  When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these \ncases  [were]  in  agreement  with  the  terms  of  this  plea,”  Belohlavek  replied,  “I  have  spoken  to  \nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,  \n                                                 \n360\n  Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification letter to Acosta, who responded with his own edited version \nstating, “What do you think?”  Villafaña edited it further.     \n361\n  The letter began with the statement, “On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.”  A week \nafter  Epstein’s  state  guilty  plea,  Villafaña  notified  Acosta,  Sloman,  and  other  supervisors  that  “[Epstein’s  local  \nattorney] Jack Goldberger is back in town today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification.  If I face resistance on that front, I will let you know.”    \n362\n  According to Villafaña, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications following the \nstate plea and to share the draft notification letters with the defense.  \n\n \n235 \n \nyes.”  The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the \nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age 18, Belohlavek spoke \nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.\n363\n   \n Both Villafaña and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the \nplea hearing.  Later that day, Villafaña met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 31 individuals \nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.   \n In her 2015 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to attend \nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation \nof  Epstein’s  abuse  of  me.”    She  stated  that  she  “would  have  attended  and  tried  to  object  to  the  \njudge  and  prevent  that  plea  from  going  forward,”  had  she  known  that  the  state  plea  “had  some  \nconnection  to  blocking  the  prosecution  of  my  case.”    Similarly,  CVRA  petitioner  Jane  Doe  #2  \nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”   \n   An   attorney   who   represented   several   victims,   including   one   whom   the   state   had   \nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 30, 2008, in \norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of \none  of  his  clients.    The  USAO  had  not  informed  him  about  the  plea  hearing.\n364\n    Moreover,  the  \nattorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in \nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s attorneys in the state case (with the \nAssistant State Attorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 30, 2008 plea \nhearing  from  the  State  Attorney’s  Office.\n365\n    Similarly,  another  of  the  victims  the  state  had  \nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her attorney that she received subpoenas from the \nState Attorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.  Belohlavek \ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing, \nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically” \nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses.  On July 24, 2008, the \nState Attorney’s Office sent letters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2008 \n(although the plea occurred on June 30, 2008) and listed Epstein’s sentence.  The letters did not \nmention the NPA or the federal investigation. \nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS \nA. Immediately  After  Epstein’s  State  Guilty  Pleas,  Villafaña  Notifies  Some  \nVictims’ Attorneys \n Villafaña’s contemporaneous notes show that immediately after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 \nguilty  pleas,  she  attempted  to  reach  by  telephone  five  attorneys  representing  various  victims  in  \n                                                 \n363\n    Villafaña,  who  was  present  in  court  and  heard  Belohlavek’s  representation,  told  OPR  that  she  had  no  \ninformation as to whether or how the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.    \n364\n  Villafaña did contact this attorney’s law partner later that day.   \n365\n  When interviewed by OPR in 2020, this same attorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite \nthe  fact  that  his  client  was  a  minor  at  the  time  Epstein  victimized  her,  she  was  not  the  minor  victim  that  the  state  \nidentified in the information charging Epstein. \n\n \n236 \n \ncivil  suits  that  were  pending  against  Epstein.\n366\n    Villafaña  also  emailed  one  of  the  pro  bono \nattorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal \ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the \nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the \nvictims.”  Villafaña advised Goldberger:  “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].  \nI do not know whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under \nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.” \nB. July 7, 2008:  The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated \n On  July  3,  2008,  victims’  attorney  Edwards  spoke  to  Villafaña  by  telephone  about  the  \nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”\n367\n  In \nhis  2017  affidavit  filed  in  the  CVRA  litigation,  Edwards  asserted  that  during  this  conversation,  \nVillafaña did not inform him of the NPA,\n but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was \nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.”  However, in an \nemail Villafaña sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that \n“his  clients  can  name  many  more  victims  and  wanted  to  know  if  we  can  get  out  of  the  deal.”    \nVillafaña  told  Sloman  that  after  she  told  Edwards  that  the  government  was  bound  by  the  \nagreement,  assuming  Epstein  completed  it,  Edwards  asked  that  “if  there  is  the  slightest  bit  of  \nhesitation  on  Epstein’s  part  of  completing  his  performance,  that  he  and  his  [three]  clients  be  \nallowed to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”\n368\n   \n That same day, Edwards wrote a letter to Villafaña, complaining that Epstein’s state court \nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafaña to “move \nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes \nMr. Epstein has committed.”   \n On July 7, 2008, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane \nDoe.”  She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane \nDoe 1” and “Jane Doe 2.”\n369\n  Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights \nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting \nwith the victims.  The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the \nCVRA.  The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were \n                                                 \n366\n  According  to Villafaña’s  handwritten  notes  from  June  30,  2008,  Villafaña  left  a  message  for  two  of  the  \nattorneys.  \n367\n  In his 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on \nJune 30, 2008, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2008.  \n368\n  Sloman responded, “Thanks.”  \n369\n  Later attempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court. \n\n \n237 \n \nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2007 to \ndefer prosecution to the state.\n370\n  \nC. July 2008:  Villafaña Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Letter to Listed \nVictims \n On July 8, 2008, Villafaña provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for 18 U.S.C. \n§  2255  purposes,  noting  that  she  had  inadvertently  left  off  one  individual  in  her  June  30,  2008  \nletter.  Villafaña also informed the defense that, beginning the following day, she would distribute \nnotifications  to  each  of  the  32  victims  and  their  counsel  informing  them  that  Epstein’s  attorney  \nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages.  Finally, the \nletter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one \nof these victims is entitled to proceed under 18 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the \nterms of the NPA.  \n After exchanging emails and letters with the defense concerning the content of the notice \nletter,  Villafaña  drafted  a  letter  she  sent,  on  July  9  and  10,  to  nine  victims  who  had  previously  \nretained counsel.  The letter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of” Epstein’s \nJune 30, 2008 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to \nengage  in  prostitution,  and  his  sentence  of  a  total  of  18  months’  imprisonment  followed  by  12  \nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of \nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.”  The letter included a reference to the \n18  U.S.C.  §  2255  provision  of  the  NPA,  and  although  the  defense  had  never  agreed  to  it,  used  \nlanguage from Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein defense attorney Sanchez clarifying \nthe  damages  provision.    The  paragraph  below  was  described  as  “[o]ne  such  condition  to  which  \nEpstein has agreed”: \nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an \noffense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, \nwill  have  the  same  rights  to  proceed  under  Section  2255  as  she  \nwould  have  had,  if  Mr.  Epstein  had  been  tried  federally  and  \nconvicted of an enumerated offense.  For purposes of implementing \nthis  paragraph,  the  United  States  shall  provide  Mr.  Epstein’s  \nattorneys  with  a  list  of  individuals  whom  it  was  prepared  to  \nname . . . as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.  Any \njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority \ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, \nshall  consider  that  it  is  the  intent  of  the  parties  to  place  these  \nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had \nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial.  No more; no less.  \nOn July 10, 2008, Villafaña sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of Identified Victims,” \nhighlighting  the  defendant’s  obligations  under  the  NPA  concerning  victim  lawsuits  pursuant  to  \n                                                 \n370\n    As  described  in  Section  XII.G  of  this  Part,  the  matter  continued  in  litigation  for  years  and  resulted  in  the  \ndistrict court’s February 21, 2019 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA \nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.  \n\n \n238 \n \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to \nname as victims of an enumerated offense.”\n 371\n  The same day, Villafaña sent Goldberger a second \nletter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.   \n Villafaña informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to \nthe  listed  victims  who  were  unrepresented,  to  inform  them  that  the  case  was  resolved  and  to  \nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail.  With regard to the content of the telephone calls, \nVillafaña proposed the following language to the case agents: \nWe  are  calling  to  inform  you  about  the  resolution  of  the  Epstein  \ninvestigation and to thank you for your help. \nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him \nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of 18 \nmonths imprisonment followed by one year of home confinement.  \nMr.  Epstein  also  made  a  concession  regarding  the  payment  of  \nrestitution.   \nAll of these terms are set out in a letter that AUSA Villafaña is going \nto send out.  Do you have a lawyer?  Get name or address.  If not[,] \nwhere  do  you  want  [the]  letter  sent?    If  you  have  questions  when  \nyou  receive  the  letter,  please  understand  that  we  cannot  provide  \nlegal   advice   but   the   lawyers   at   the   following   victim   rights   \norganizations are able to help you at no cost to you.  (Provide names \nand phone numbers) \nAlso ask about counseling and let them know that counseling is still \navailable even though the investigation is closed.  \nOn July 21, 2008, Villafaña sent the letter to the 11 unrepresented victims whose addresses \nthe FBI had by that time confirmed.  Villafaña provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of \nthe letter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).   \n \nD. July – August 2008:  The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Letter to Victims \nResiding Outside of the United States \n While attempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact \ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States.  On July 23 and August 8, 2008, \nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmitted an automated VNS form notification letter to \neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country.  This \n                                                 \n371\n  A month later, in an August 18, 2008 letter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim \nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2007 execution of the NPA.  Villafaña also raised \nwith  Acosta,  Sloman,  and  other  supervisors  the  question  whether  the  USAO  had  developed  sufficient  evidence  to  \ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2008 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously \ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list.  Ultimately, Villafaña sent the defense a \nletter confirming that the government’s July 10, 2008 victim list was “the final list.”      \n\n \n239 \n \nletter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification letter the FBI had sent to \nvictims  (in  2006,  2007,  and  2008)  in  that  it  identified  each  recipient  as  “a  possible  victim  of  a  \nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.   \n The letter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 30, 2008, or \nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state \nplea.    Rather,  like  the  previous  FBI  VNS-generated  letter,  the  letter  requested  the  victims’  \n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”  \n For each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafaña also drafted a \nnotification letter concerning the June 30, 2008 plea and the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were \nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s letters.  However, FBI records do not reflect whether \nthe USAO’s letter was delivered to the two victims.     \nE. August – September 2008:  The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose \nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Letter  \n On August 1, 2008, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to \nthe NPA.  The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.\n372\n  \nOn August 21, 2008, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of \nthe NPA subject to a protective order.  In addition, the court ordered the government to produce \nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request: \n(d)  If  any  individuals  who  have  been  identified  by  the  USAO  as  \nvictims  of  Epstein  and/or  any  attorney(s)  for  those  individuals  \nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall \nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals \nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any \nthird  party  absent  further  court  order,  following  notice  to  and  an  \nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]\n373\n \n   In September 2008, the USAO sent a revised notification letter to victims, and attorneys \nfor  represented  victims,  concerning  Epstein’s  state  court  guilty  plea  and  his  agreement  to  not  \ncontest  liability  in  victim  civil  suits  brought  under  18  U.S.C.  §  2255.\n374\n    The  September  letter  \nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein attorney Lefkowitz that the government’s earlier \nnotification  letter  referenced  language  concerning  18  U.S.C.  §  2255  that  the  government  had  \nproposed in Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein attorney Sanchez, but that the defense \nhad  not  accepted.\n375\n    As  a  result  of  the  defense  objection,  Villafaña  determined  that  she  was  \n                                                 \n372\n  Pursuant to paragraph 13 of the NPA, Villafaña made Epstein’s attorneys aware of the petitioners’ request \nfor the NPA.   \n373\n  Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at 1-2 (Aug. 21, 2008). \n374\n  The USAO also sent a notification letter to additional victims who had not received a notification letter in \nJuly. \n375\n  This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two. \n\n \n240 \n \nobligated  to  amend  her  prior  letter  to  victims  to  correct  the  reference  to  the  December  letter.\n376\n  \nAccordingly,   the   September   letter   contained   no   information   about   the   parties’   intent   in   \nimplementing 18 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s \nwaiver  of  his  right  to  contest  liability  under  the  provision.    In  addition,  the  September  letter  \ndescribed  the  appointment  of  a  special  master,  the  special  master’s  selection  of  an  attorney  to  \nrepresent the victims in their 18 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement \nto pay the attorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation.  The letter also clarified that \nEpstein’s agreement to pay for attorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.   \n The government also intended for the letter to comply with the court’s order concerning \nproviding  victims  with  copies  of  the  NPA.    The  initial  draft  included  a  paragraph  advising  the  \nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:   \nIn  addition,  a  judge  has  ordered  that  the  United  States  make  \navailable  to  any  designated  victim  (and/or  her  attorney)  a  copy  of  \nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so \nlong as the victim (and/or her attorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to \nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court.  If [the victim] \nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me know, and I will \nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.  \nThe government shared draft versions of the September letter with Epstein’s counsel and \nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed letter.  For example, in response to the above \nlanguage regarding the August 21, 2008 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued \nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice \nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality \nprovisions of the [NPA].”  In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafaña \nrevised the paragraph as follows:\n \n \nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and \ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement \nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein.  [The attorney selected \nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or \nif  you  select  another  attorney  to  represent  you,  that  attorney  can  \nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].   \n On September 18, 2009, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been \nfiled in the state case.\n377\n \n                                                 \n376\n  In the letter, Villafaña expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December 19, 2007 \nletter  that  was  included  in  the  July  2008  notification  letter,  noting  that  the  July  2008  letter  had  been  approved  by  \ndefense counsel before being sent.  \n377\n See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach \nPost, Sept. 19, 2009.    \n\n \n241 \n \nF. 2010    –    2011:        Department    and    Congressional    Actions    Regarding    \nInterpretation of the CVRA \n In connection with the Department’s 2010 effort to update its 2005 Guidelines, the Office \nof the Deputy Attorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to \nrevisit its 2005 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA \nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement \nagencies.    In  response,  OLC  issued  a  December  17,  2010  opinion  entitled,  The  Availability  of  \nCrime  Victims’  Rights  Under  the  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Act  of  2004.    Based  on  the  CVRA’s  \nlanguage,  relevant  case  law,  and  memoranda  opinions  from  Department  components,  OLC  \nreaffirmed its 2005 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed \n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are \ndismissed  either  voluntarily  or  on  the  merits  (or  if  the  [g]overnment  declines  to  bring  formal  \ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”\n378\n   \n \nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2005 Guidelines in October 2011 \nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal \ncharges were filed.  The 2011 revision did, however, add language concerning victim consultation \nbefore a defendant is charged:  “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has \nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the \nfiling  of  a  charging  instrument  with  the  court.”\n379\n    The  use  of  the  word  “should”  in  the  2011  \nGuidelines  indicates  that  “personnel  are  expected  to  take  the  action  .  .  .  unless  there  is  an  \nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”\n380\n  Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be \ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”\n381\n  The revisions \nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea \nproceedings.\n382\n      \nOn November 2, 2011, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a letter to \nAttorney  General  Eric  Holder,  arguing  that  the  2011  Guidelines  revisions  “conflict[ed]  quite  \nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2011 Guidelines did “not extend any rights \nto  victims  until  charges  have  been  filed.”    The  Department’s  response  emphasized  that  the  \n                                                 \n378\n  OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a matter of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA \nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.   \n379\n  See 2011   Guidelines,   Art.   V,   ¶   G.2,   available   at   https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/ \nag_guidelines2012. pdf.   In its 2011 online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such \nconsultation  when  reasonable,  but  it  also  continued  to  maintain  that  there  was  no  CVRA  right  to  confer  for  pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.   \n380\n  See 2011 Guidelines, Art. I, ¶ B.2. \n381\n  See 2011 Guidelines, Art. V, ¶ G.2. \n382\n  The 2005 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to \nexercise  their  right  to  be  reasonably  heard  at  plea  proceedings,  only  at  sentencing.    See 2005  Guidelines,  Art.  IV,  \n¶  C.3.b.(2).    However,  the  2005  Guidelines  generally  require  AUSAs  to  use  their  best  efforts  to  comply  with  the  \nCVRA,  and  the  CVRA  specifically  affords  victims  the  right  to  be  heard  at  plea  proceedings.    The  2011  revision  \nremedied this omission. \n\n \n242 \n \nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to \nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.”  The response also referenced OLC’s December \n2010 opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting \nthat  “the  new  AG  Guidelines  go  further  and  provide  that  Department  prosecutors  should  make  \nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective \nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”\n383\n \n \n In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the following two rights: \n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain \nor deferred prosecution agreement.  \n \n(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the \nservices  described  in  section  503(c)  of  the  Victims’  Rights  and  \nRestitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10\u0019\u0013\u001a\u000bF\f\fDQG SURYLGHG FRQWDFW\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the \nDepartment of Justice. \n \nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status  \n While  the  CVRA  litigation  was  pending  in  the  Southern  District  of  Florida,  numerous  \nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge \nas  “related  cases,”  as  a  matter  of  judicial  economy  pursuant  to  the  Local  Rules.    As  the  parties  \nagreed on settlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.\n384\n  Several of the victims who had \nsettled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their \nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.\n385\n    \n \n In the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights \nto confer by (1) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending letters to the \nvictims claiming that the matter was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and \n(3)  not  properly  informing  the  victims  that  the  state  plea  would  also  resolve  the  federal  \ninvestigation.  In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right \nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right \nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the \nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.     \n \n  During  the  litigation,  the  USAO  argued  that  (1)  the  victims  had  no  right  to  notice  or  \nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s \n                                                 \n383\n  157 Cong. Rec. S7359-02 (2011) (Kyl letter and Department response). \n384\n  Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well.  In addition, numerous \nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation.  For example, one attorney told OPR that he resolved 16 victim \ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.  Court data indicate that the attorney filed only 3 of the 16 cases he said \nhe resolved.              \n385\n  Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2015 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at 1 (July 24, \n2015). \n\n \n243 \n \nletters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the matter was \n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that \nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafaña contacted the petitioners’ attorney prior to Epstein’s \nstate plea to advise him of the hearing.  Nonetheless, Villafaña told OPR that, while there were \nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is \na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required.  I was obviously \nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].” \n  Over  the  course  of  the  litigation,  the  district  court  made  various  rulings  interpreting  the  \nprovisions  of  the  CVRA,  including  the  court’s  key  conclusion  that  victim  CVRA  rights  “attach  \nbefore  the  Government  brings  formal  charges  against  a  defendant.”    The  court  also  held  that  \n(1) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a \nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the \nstatute”;  (2)  the  CVRA  authorizes  the  setting  aside  of  pre-charge  prosecutorial  agreements”;  \n(3)  the  CVRA’s  “reasonable  right  to  confer”  “extends  to  the  pre-charge  state  of  criminal  \ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes committed by Epstein render \nthe Doe  petitioners  “victims”  under  the  CVRA;  and  (5)  “questions  pertaining  to  [the]  equitable  \ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”   \n  On  February  21,  2019,  the  district  court  granted  the  petitioners’  Motion  for  Partial  \nSummary  Judgment,  ruling  that  “once  the  Government  failed  to  advise  the  victims  about  its  \nintention  to  enter  into  the  NPA,  a  violation  of  the  CVRA  occurred.”    The  government  did  not  \ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court \nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners \nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.”  The court found that the post-\nNPA  letters  the  government  sent  to  victims  describing  the  investigation  as  ongoing  “misled  the  \nvictims  to  believe  that  federal  prosecution  was  still  a  possibility”  and  that  “[i]t  was  a  material  \nomission  for  the  Government  to  suggest  to  the  victims  that  they  have  patience  relative  to  an  \ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”\n386\n  \n \n  The  court  relied  on  Dean and BP  Products  to  support  its  holding  and  noted  that  the  \ngovernment’s  action  with  respect  to  the  NPA  was  especially  troubling  because,  unlike  a  plea  \nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is \nentered into without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard \nregarding any aspect of the case.”  The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure \nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with \nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with \nthe Court.”     \n \n   Although   the   USAO   defended   its   actions   by   citing   the   2005   Guidelines   for   the   \nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not attach until after a defendant is charged, the court \nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold \ninformation about the NPA from the victims.”  The court found that the government’s reliance on \n                                                 \n386\n    The  court  did  not  resolve  the  factual  question  as  to  whether  the  victims  were  given  adequate  notice  of  \nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.   \n\n \n244 \n \nthe 2005 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with \nEpstein’s attorneys, in which the government acknowledged that “it had obligations to notify the \nvictims.”    The  court  ordered  the  parties  to  submit  additional  briefs  regarding  the  appropriate  \nremedies.  Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission \nof  the  NPA;  a  written  apology  to  all  victims  from  the  government;  a  meeting  with  Acosta,  \nVillafaña,  and  her  supervisors;  access  to  government  records,  including  grand  jury  materials;  \ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and attorneys’ fees.\n387\n  \n \n  Following  Epstein’s  indictment  on  federal  charges  in  New  York  and  subsequent  death  \nwhile in custody, on September 16, 2019, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied \nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the \nmost  significant  issue  that  was  pending  before  the  Court,  namely,  whether  the  Government’s  \nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”\n388\n  The court did not \norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government \nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the \nproper treatment of crime victims.”\n389\n  The court also denied the petitioners’ request for attorneys’ \nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the \nmerits  of  the  issue  of  whether  there  was  a  violation  of  the  CVRA,  the  Government  asserted  \nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”   \n  On  September  30,  2019,  Wild  appealed  the  district  court’s  rejection  of  the  requested  \nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh  Circuit.\n390\n    In  its  responsive  brief,  the  government  expressed  sympathy  for  Wild  and  \n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”\n391\n  Nevertheless, the \ngovernment argued that, “as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach \nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because \nno criminal charges were brought.”\n392\n  The government conceded, however, that with regard to \nthe  New  York  prosecution  in  which  Epstein  had  been  indicted,  “[p]etitioner  and  other  Epstein  \n                                                 \n387\n  Doe, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2019). \n388\n  Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. 16, 2019).  Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention \nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and \nto  receive  fair  notice  of  the  proceedings,  noting  that  “[t]hese  rights  all  flow  from  the  right  to  confer  and  were  \nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”     \n389\n  The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal \nSystem to the USAO on January 10, 2020. \n390\n  See In re Wild, No. 19-13843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, \n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (Sept. 30, 2019).  \n391\n  Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime \nVictims Rights Act at 14 (Oct. 31, 2019).  As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the \nU.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.   \n392\n  The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2015 to include a victim’s right to be \nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to \nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court \ninvolvement.  \n\n \n245 \n \nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal \ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.”  During oral \nargument on January 16, 2020, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:    \nThe  issue  is  whether  or  not  the  office  was  fully  transparent  with  \nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA, \nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was \nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.  The government \nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way \nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.\n393\n \n On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied \nWild’s  petition  for  a  writ  of  mandamus,  concluding  that  “the  CVRA  does  not  apply  before  the  \ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the \npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”\n394\n  The court conducted a thorough analysis \nof  the  language  of  the  statute,  the  legislative  history,  and  previous  court  decisions.    The  court  \ndistinguished In re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any \nanalysis  of  the  CVRA’s  text,  history,  or  structural  underpinnings.”   The  court  noted  that  its  \ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2010 OLC opinion concerning \nvictim  standing  under  the  CVRA  and  the  Department’s  efforts  in  “implementing  regulations.”    \nFinally, the court raised separation of powers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s) \ninterpretation  of  victim  standing  under  the  CVRA,  noting  that  such  an  interpretation  would  \ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.    \n Nevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying \ncase,  stating  that  the  government  “[s]eemingly  .  .  .  defer[red]  to  Epstein’s  lawyers”  regarding  \ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from \npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”  The court concluded that \nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other \nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the \ngovernment was obligated to do so.  In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly \nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the \n“plain  and  unambiguous  text  of  the  CVRA  does  not  include  [a]  post-indictment  temporal  \nrestriction.”  \n On May 5, 2020, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.  On August 7, 2020, the court \ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this \nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2020.  \n  \n                                                 \n393\n  Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. 19-13843 (Jan. 16, 2020). \n394\n  In re Wild, 955 F.3d 1196, 1220 (11th Cir. 2020).   \n\n \n246 \n \n[Page Intentionally Left Blank] \n \n\n \n247 \n \nCHAPTER THREE \nPART TWO:  APPLICABLE STANDARDS \n \nI.

DEPARTMENT POLICY:  THE 2005 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR \nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2005 GUIDELINES) \n In 2005, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to \nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA.  The purpose of the 2005 Guidelines was “to establish \nguidelines  to  be  followed  by  officers  and  employees  of  Department  of  Justice  investigative,  \nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”    \nThe relevant portions of the 2005 Guidelines are as follows: \n \nArticle IV:  Services to Victims and Witnesses \n \nA. Investigation Stage \nThe investigative agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend \nthrough  the  prosecution  of  the  case.  In  some  instances,  when  explicitly  stated,  the  \ninvestigative  agency’s  responsibility  for  a  certain  task  is  transferred  to  the  prosecuting  \nagency when charges are filed. \n \n . . . . \n \n 2.  Identification of Victims. At the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at \n which it may be done without interfering with an investigation, the responsible official of \n the investigative agency shall identify the victims of the crime.   \n  \n 3.  Description of Services. \n \n      a.  Information, Notice, and Referral \n \n(1)    Initial  Information  and  Notice.  Responsible  officials  must  advise  a  victim  \npursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which \nit  may  be  done  without  interfering  with  an  investigation.    To  comply  with  this  \nrequirement,  it  is  recommended  that  victims  be  given  a  printed  brochure  or  card  \nthat  briefly  describes  their  rights  and  the  available  services,  identifies  the  local  \n\n \n250 \n \nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness \ncoordinator or specialist and other key officials.  A victim must be informed of— \n(a)  His or her rights as enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  \n \n(b)  His or her right entitlement, on request, to the services listed in 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10607(c).  \n \n(c)  The name, title, business address, and telephone number of the responsible \nofficial to whom such a request for services should be addressed.  \n \n(d)    The  place  where  the  victim  may  receive  emergency  medical  or  social  \nservices.  \n \n(e)  The availability of any restitution or other relief (including crime victim \ncompensation programs) to which the victim may be entitled under this or any \nother applicable law and the manner in which such relief may be obtained.  \n \n(f)    Public  and  private  programs  that  are  available  to  provide  counseling,  \ntreatment, and other support to the victim.  \n \n . . . .  \n \n(i)  The availability of services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking.  \n \n        (j)  The option of being included in VNS.  \n \n (k)  Available protections from intimidation and harassment.  \n \n . . . . \n \n(3)  Notice  during  the  investigation.  During  the  investigation  of  a  crime,  a  \nresponsible  official  shall  provide  the  victim  with  the  earliest  possible  notice  \nconcerning— \n \n(a)    The  status  of  the  investigation  of  the  crime,  to  the  extent  that  it  is  \nappropriate and will not interfere with the investigation.  \n \n(b)  The arrest of a suspected offender.  \n \n \nB.  Prosecution Stage \n \nThe prosecution stage begins when charges are filed and continues through postsentencing \nlegal proceedings, including appeals and collateral attacks. \n \n\n \n251 \n \n1.  Responsible Officials. For cases in which charges have been instituted, the responsible \nofficial is the U.S. Attorney in whose district the prosecution is pending.  \n \n2.  Services to Crime Victims \n  \n. . . . \n  \n b.  Information, Notice, and Referrals \n \n(1)    Notice  of  Rights.  Officers  and  employees  of  the  Department  of  Justice  shall  \nmake their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of the rights enumerated \nin 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  \n \n(2)  Notice of Right To Seek Counsel. The prosecutor shall advise the crime victim \nthat the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights \ndescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a).  \n \n(3)    Notice  of  Right  To  Attend  Trial.  The  responsible  official  should  inform  the  \ncrime victim about the victim’s right to attend the trial regardless of whether the \nvictim intends to make a statement or present any information about the effect of \nthe crime on the victim during sentencing.  \n \n(4)  Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, a responsible official \nshall  provide  the  victim,  using  VNS  (where  appropriate),  with  reasonable  notice  \nof— \n \n(a)  The filing of charges against a suspected offender.  \n \n(b)  The release or escape of an offender or suspected offender.  \n \n(c)  The schedule of court proceedings. \n \n(i)    The  responsible  official  shall  provide  the  victim  with  reasonable,  \naccurate,  and  timely  notice  of  any  public  court  proceeding  or  parole  \nproceeding  that  involves  the  crime  against  the  victim.  In  the  event  of  an  \nemergency or other last-minute hearing or change in the time or date of a \nhearing,  the  responsible  official  should  consider  providing  notice  by  \ntelephone  or  expedited  means.  This  notification  requirement  relates  to  \npostsentencing proceedings as well.  \n \n(ii)    The  responsible  official  shall  also  give  reasonable  notice  of  the  \nscheduling or rescheduling of any other court proceeding that the victim or \nwitness is required or entitled to attend.  \n \n(d)  The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the rendering of \na verdict after trial.  \n\n \n252 \n \n \n(e)    If  the  offender  is  convicted,  the  sentence  and  conditions  of  supervised  \nrelease, if any, that are imposed.  \n \n . . . . \n \n(6)  Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim \nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief \n[previously identified]. \n \nc.  Consultation With a Government Attorney \n \n(1)  In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the \nGovernment  in  the  case.    The  victim’s  right  to  confer,  however,  shall  not  be  \nconstrued  to  impair  prosecutorial  discretion.    Federal  prosecutors  should  be  \navailable  to  consult  with  victims  about  major  case  decisions,  such  as  dismissals,  \nrelease  of  the  accused  pending  judicial  proceedings  (when  such  release  is  for  \nnoninvestigative  purposes),  plea  negotiations,  and  pretrial  diversion.    Because  \nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose \nwhatever  they  have  learned  from  consulting  with  prosecutors,  such  consultations  \nmay  be  limited  to  gathering  information  from  victims  and  conveying  only  \nnonsensitive  data  and  public  information.  Consultations  should  comply  with  the  \nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct. \n \nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither \nthe  Department’s  advocacy  for  victims  nor  any  other  effort  that  the  Department  \nmay  make  on  their  behalf  constitutes  or  creates  an  attorney-client  relationship  \nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government. \n \nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims. \n  \n(2)  Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult \nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays \nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court \nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor. \n \n(3)    Proposed  Plea  Agreements.  Responsible  officials  should  make  reasonable  \nefforts   to   notify   identified   victims   of,   and   consider   victims’   views   about,   \nprospective  plea  negotiations.  In  determining  what  is  reasonable,  the  responsible  \nofficial  should  consider  factors  relevant  to  the  wisdom  and  practicality  of  giving  \nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not \nlimited to, the following factors: \n \n(a)  The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. \n(b)  The number of victims. \n(c)  Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea. \n\n \n253 \n \n(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. \n(e)  Whether there is another need for confidentiality. \n(f)    Whether  the  victim  is  a  possible  witness  in  the  case  and  the  effect  that  \nrelaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial. \n \nIII. FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  \nA. FRPC 4-4.1 – Candor in Dealing with Others \n FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact \nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.  A comment to this rule \nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or \nomissions  that  are  the  equivalent  of  affirmative  false  statements,”  and  “[w]hether  a  particular  \nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.” \n \nB. FRPC 4-8.4 – Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice \n FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \ndeceit, or misrepresentation.   \n \n FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice \nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.   \n \n As previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct \nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice \nof law.”  Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 41 So. 3d at 172. \n  \n\n \n254 \n \n[Page Left Intentionally Blank] \n  \n\n \n255 \n \nCHAPTER THREE \nPART THREE:  ANALYSIS \n  \nI. OVERVIEW \nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of \nthe NPA, public and media attention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims.  In \nthe  CVRA  litigation  and  in  more  recent  media  reports,  victims  complained  that  they  were  not  \ninformed  about  the  government’s  intention  to  end  its  investigation  of  Epstein  because  the  \ngovernment  did  not  consult  with  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed;  did  not  inform  them  of  \nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to attend; and \nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing.  The district \ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’ \nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and \nthat  “[i]t  was  a  material  omission  for  the  Government  to  suggest  to  the  victims  that  they  have  \npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”\n395\n  \nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that \nthe  prosecutors  had  purposefully  failed  to  inform  victims  of  the  NPA  to  prevent  victims  from  \ncomplaining publicly or in state court.   \nOPR  examined  the  government’s  course  of  conduct  when  interacting  with  the  victims,  \nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision \nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision \nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 30, 2008.  \nOPR considered whether letters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained \nfalse or misleading statements.  OPR also evaluated representations Villafaña made to victims in \nJanuary and February 2008, and to an attorney for a victim in June 2008.   \nII. THE   SUBJECTS   DID   NOT   VIOLATE   A   CLEAR   AND   UNAMBIGUOUS   \nSTANDARD  BY  ENTERING  INTO  THE  NPA  WITHOUT  CONSULTING  THE  \nVICTIMS \n During the CVRA litigation, the government acknowledged that the USAO did not consult \nwith  victims  about  the  government’s  intention  to  enter  into  the  NPA.    In  its  February  21,  2019  \nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about \nits  intention  to  enter  into  the  NPA,  a  violation  of  the  CVRA  occurred.”    OPR  considered  this  \nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined \nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, federal prosecutors were obligated \nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject attorneys—Acosta, \nSloman,  Menchel,  Lourie,  or  Villafaña—intentionally  violated  or  recklessly  disregarded  that  \nobligation.   \n                                                 \n395\n  Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1219, 1221 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 21, 2019). \n\n \n256 \n \n As discussed below, OPR concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a clear and \nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without \na federal criminal charge.  In September 2007, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not \ninterpret  CVRA  rights  to  attach  unless  and  until  federal  charges  had  been  filed,  and  the  federal  \ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal \ncharges were brought.  Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find \nprofessional misconduct unless a subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and \nunambiguous standard.  Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject attorneys’ conduct did not rise to \nthe  level  of  professional  misconduct.    OPR  nevertheless  concludes  that  the  lack  of  consultation  \nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court \ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as \na  whole,  and  is  contradictory  to  the  Department’s  mission  to  “minimize  the  frustration  and  \nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”\n396\n  \nA. At  the  Time,  No  Clear  and  Unambiguous  Standard  Required  the  USAO  to  \nNotify  Victims  Regarding  Case-Related  Events  until  after  the  Filing  of  \nCriminal Charges \nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of \nwhether  an  individual  qualifies  as  a  victim  to  whom  CVRA  rights  attach  was  neither  clear  nor  \nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2007.  At that \ntime,  the  Department  interpreted  the  CVRA  in  a  way  that  differed  markedly  from  the  district  \ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.  \n  The  CVRA  defines  a  “crime  victim”  as  “a  person  directly  and  proximately  harmed  as  a  \nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”  On April \n1, 2005, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ \nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the \nstatus  ends  if  there  is  a  subsequent  decision  not  to  indict  or  prosecute  the  Federal  offense  that  \ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.”  Beginning with the 2005 OLC guidance, the Department has \nconsistently  taken  the  position  that  CVRA  rights  do  not  apply  until  the  initiation  of  criminal  \ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information.  OLC applied its \ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2005, but noted that the obligation created by the \neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal \nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 [(VRRA)] indicates that this right \napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”\n397\n  Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in \nMay 2005, the Department issued the 2005 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.   \n  The  2005  Guidelines  assigned  CVRA-related  obligations  to  prosecutors  only  after  the  \ninitiation of federal charges.  Specifically, the 2005 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution \nstage,”  the  “responsible  official”  should  make  reasonable  efforts  to  notify  identified  victims  of,  \n                                                 \n396\n  2005 Guidelines, Foreword. \n397\n  Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2005 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § 10606, \nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA. \n\n \n257 \n \nand  consider  victims’  views  about,  prospective  plea  negotiations.\n398\n    The  “prosecution  stage”  \nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.\n399\n     \n At the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2007, few courts had addressed victim \nstanding under the CVRA.  Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that \nstanding attached only upon the filing of federal charges.\n400\n  Two cases relied upon by the court \nin its February 2019 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were \ndecided after the NPA was signed.  \n The CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this \nReport—show that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a matter \nof debate.\n401\n  In a November 21, 2019 letter to Attorney General William Barr, a Congressional \nRepresentative  stated  that  she  had  recently  introduced  legislation  specifically  to  “[c]larify  that  \nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key \npre-charging  developments  in  a  case,  such  as  .  .  .  non-prosecution  agreements.”\n402 \n  The  CVRA  \nlitigation  arising  from  the  Epstein  case  shows  the  lack  of  clarity  regarding  when  CVRA  rights  \napply:    the  district  court  concluded  that  CVRA  rights  applied  pre-charge,  but  a  sharply  divided  \npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has \nnow been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.   \nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the \nlower courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA \nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims \nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA \ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of \nfederal criminal charges.\n403\n    \n                                                 \n398\n    2005  Guidelines,  Art.  IV,  ¶  B.2.c.(3).    Under  the  2005  Guidelines,  the  term  “should”  means  that  “the  \nemployee  is  expected  to  take  the  action  or  provide  the  service  described  unless  there  is  an  appropriate,  articulable  \nreason not to do so.”  Id., Art.

(2019).  \n402\n  165 Cong. Rec. E1495-01 (2019). \n403\n  Violations of an unambiguous obligation concerning victims’ rights could result in a violation of the rules of \nprofessional responsibility.  For example, in Attorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, 109 A.3d 1184 (Md. 2015), the \nCourt of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster \nfamily about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the matter \nwas a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived \nthe victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution.  The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional \n\n \n258 \n \n            In            Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language \nof  the  VRRA,  noting  that  the  VRRA  “clearly  extends  victim-notice  rights  into  the  pre-charge  \nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its \ninvestigation of Epstein.\n \n As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights \nand services; however, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court \nor by administrative complaint.  Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the \nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an attorney for \nthe  government.\n \n  However,  the  rights  portion  of  the  VRRA  was  repealed  upon  passage  of  the  \nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.  \nThe  portion  of  the  VRRA  directing  federal  law  enforcement  agencies  to  provide  certain  \nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect following passage \nof the CVRA.\n \n Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official \nto  “inform  a  victim  of  any  restitution  or  other  relief  to  which  the  victim  may  be  entitled,”  and  \nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of \nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and \nto  the  extent  that  it  will  not  interfere  with  the  investigation”—may  have  applied  to  the  Epstein  \ninvestigation.  However, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part \nof  the  subject  attorneys,  as  the  2005  Guidelines  assigned  the  duty  of  enforcing  the  two  \nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors.  Moreover, the VRRA did not \nrequire  notice  to  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed  because,  at  that  point,  the  case  remained  \n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under \nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2008.  Once Epstein did so, and the victims \nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the \nvictims with appropriate notification.   \nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was \nIntended to Silence Victims \nDuring  her  OPR  interviews,  Villafaña  recalled  more  than  one  discussion  in  which  she  \nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on \nSeptember  24,  2007.    Acosta,  Sloman,  Menchel,  and  Lourie,  however,  had  no  recollection  of  \ndiscussions  about  consulting  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed,  and  Menchel  disputed  \nVillafaña’s assertions.  OPR found only one written reference before that date, explicitly raising \nthe  issue  of  consultation.    Given  the  absence  of  contemporaneous  records,  OPR  was  unable  to  \nconclusively  determine  whether  the  lack  of  consultation  stemmed  from  an  affirmative  decision  \nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about \nthe NPA before it was signed.  Villafaña’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman \nmay  have  been  concerned  with  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  plea  negotiations  and  did  not  \nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations.  OPR \n                                                 \nConduct 1.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.  The holding in Smith \nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among \nothers,  to  receive  various  notices  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  concerning  “a  case  originating  by  indictment  or  \ninformation filed in a circuit court.”  However, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts \nare  substantially  different  from  the  Epstein  investigation.    In  Smith,  the  criminal  defendant  had  been  arrested  and  \ncharged before entering a plea.   \n\n \n259 \n \ndid not find evidence showing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from \nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.      \nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification \ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007, the records contain little about \nthe  subjects’  views  regarding  consultation  with  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed.    In  a  \nSeptember 6, 2007 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning \nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafaña raised the topic of victim \nconsultation  with  Sloman:    “The  agents  and  I  have  not  reached  out  to  the  victims  to  get  their  \napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . . \n[A]nd  the  [PBPD]  Chief  wanted  to  know  if  the  victims  had  been  consulted  about  the  deal.”\n404\n  \nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.”  Villafaña recalled that after she \nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.”\n405\n  Villafaña also told \nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.”\n \n Villafaña also recalled a discussion with \nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input \non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.  \nYou can’t disclose them.”\n406\n    \n \n None of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about \nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations.  Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to \nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of settlement negotiations; \nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.   \n Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering \ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.”  Sloman \nbelieved  the  USAO  was  obligated  only  to  notify  victims  about  resolution  of  “the  cases  that  we  \nhandled, filed cases.”  Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution \nof  the  matter,  he  did  not  “think  that  that  was  a  concern  of  ours  at  the  time  to  consult  with  [the  \nvictims] prior to entering into . . . the NPA.”   \n Lourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about \nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafaña that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.  \nHe  stated  that  everything  the  USAO  did  was  “to  try  and  get  the  best  result  as  possible  for  the  \nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that. . . . [I]f you \nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim \nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n \n   \n                                                 \n404\n  As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims \nbecause no criminal charges had been filed.  In addition, Villafaña’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate \nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.   \n405\n  Villafaña did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.  \n406\n  Villafaña also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations \ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”  Villafaña was \nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2007.   \n\n \n260 \n \n   Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was \n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.”  Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’ \nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I \nwas focused on at least at this time.”  Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored \ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknowledged \nto  OPR,  “[C]learly,  given  the  way  it’s  played  out,  it  may  have  been  much  better  if  we  had  \n[consulted with the victims].”\n407\n \nAs  indicated,  the  contemporaneous  records  reflect  little  about  decisions  made  regarding  \nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed.  Villafaña raised the issue in writing to her \nsupervisors  in  early  September,  but  there  is  no  evidence  showing  whether  her  supervisors  \naffirmatively rejected Villafaña’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims, \nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended \nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal.  OPR notes \nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the \npassage  of  time  affected  the  recall  of  each  individual  OPR  interviewed.    Although  Villafaña  \nrecalled  discussions  with  her  supervisors  about  notifying  victims,  her  supervisors  did  not,  and  \nMenchel contended that Villafaña’s recollection is inaccurate.  Assuming the discussions occurred, \nthe timing is unclear.  Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafaña \nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely.  Any discussion involving Menchel \nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2007, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree \nto the government’s offer.  Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there \nwas little to discuss with victims.   \nTo  the  extent  that  Villafaña’s  supervisors  affirmatively  made  a  decision  not  to  consult  \nvictims, Villafaña’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about \nthe  confidentiality  of  plea  negotiations  and  a  belief  that  the  government  was  not  obligated  to  \nconsult  with  victims  about  a  pre-charge  disposition.    That  belief  accurately  reflected  the  \nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA.  Importantly, OPR did not find \nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and \nVillafaña told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting \nto  the  agreement  if  they  learned  of  it.    Because  the  subjects  did  not  violate  any  clear  and  \nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR \nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct. \nHowever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government \ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s \ntreatment of the victims.  Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a \nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal \nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect.  This was particularly important in a case in \nwhich  victims  felt  excluded  and  mistreated  by  the  state  process.    Furthermore,  in  this  case,  \nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into \nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.  The consultation provision does not \n                                                 \n407\n  Villafaña told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order \nto . . . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”   \n\n \n261 \n \nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allows victims the opportunity to express \ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made.  The lack of consultation in this case \ndenied the victims that opportunity.\n408\n   \n \nIII. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS \nBUT   RISKED   MISLEADING   VICTIMS   ABOUT   THE   STATUS   OF   THE   \nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION \nAfter  the  NPA  was  signed  on  September  24,  2007,  Villafaña  and  the  FBI  separately  \ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ attorneys, both in person and through letters.  \nApart  from  three  victims  who  likely  were  informed  in  October  or  November  2007  about  a  \nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more \ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled \nguilty  to  state  charges  until  after  Epstein  entered  his  guilty  plea  in  June  2008.    Despite  the  \ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2007, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s \ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2007, January 2008, and \nMay  2008,  letters  stating  that  the  case  was  “currently  under  investigation.”    In  its  February  21,  \n2019  opinion  in  the  CVRA  case,  the  district  court  found  those  letters  “misl[ed]  the  victims  to  \nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for \nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about \nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”\n409\n   \n  In  the  discussions  throughout  this  section,  OPR  examines  the  government’s  course  of  \nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed.  As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did \nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña acted with the intent to \nsilence  victims.    Nonetheless,  after  examining  the  full  scope  and  context  of  the  government’s  \ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning \nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.   \n In this section, OPR examines and discusses letters sent to victims by the FBI that were the \nsubject of the district court’s findings.  OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña \nwas aware of the content of the letters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production \nfor the CVRA litigation.  OPR determined that the January 10, 2008 and May 30, 2008 letters that \nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October 12, 2007 letter OPR located \nduring  its  investigation,  were  “standard  form  letter[s]”  sent  by  the  FBI’s  Victim  Specialist.    As  \nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the FBI agents continued \nto  conduct  their  investigation  in  anticipation  that  Epstein  would  breach  the  NPA;  absent  such  a  \n                                                 \n408\n  Villafaña told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was \nsigned and “ask[ing] them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”  FBI interview reports indicate that Villafaña \nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations.  See 2005 \nGuidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c (1) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying \nonly nonsensitive data and public information).  However, Villafaña did not meet with all of the victims identified in \nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA \nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.  Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at 1218. \n409\n  Doe, 359 F. Supp. 3d at 1219, 1221.   \n\n \n262 \n \nbreach, however, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.  \nThus,  the  statement  that  the  case  was  “currently  under  investigation”  was  literally  true,  but  the  \nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims \nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.   \nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Letters Sent by the \nFBI  in  October  2007,  January  2008,  and  May  2008  Describing  the  Status  of  \nthe Case as “Under Investigation”  \n The  2005  Guidelines  charged  the  FBI  with  informing  the  victims  of  CVRA  rights  and  \navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case.  During the Epstein investigation, the \nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets \nto victims following their interviews and through computer-generated letters sent to the victims by \nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist.  The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s.  The \nUSAO  has  its  own  Victim  Witness  Specialist  who  assumes  the  responsibility  for  victim  \nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”   \n The FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2007, January 2008, and \nMay  2008  letters,  a  system  the  FBI  regularly  employs  to  comply  with  its  obligations  under  the  \n2005 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative \nstage.”    The  stock  language  of  that  letter,  however,  was  generic  and  failed  to  communicate  the  \nunique  case-specific  status  of  the  Epstein  investigation  at  that  time.    The  FBI  Victim  Specialist  \nwho sent the letters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the \nNPA at the time she created the letters.\n410\n  Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the letters sent \nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.\n411 \n According to Villafaña, “The decision to issue the letters and \nthe  wording  of  those  letters  were  exclusively  FBI  decisions.”\n \n  Although  the  FBI  case  agents  \ninformed Villafaña after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form letter,” \nVillafaña had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification letter and was not aware of its \ncontents.\n412\n  Villafaña told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI letters until they were \ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2008.  \n                                                 \n410\n  The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a letter, \nbut acknowledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”  \n411\n  The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the letters and believed them to be “standard form \nletters.”  Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go \nfrom the victim coordinator.”  \n412\n    Villafaña’s  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  language  in  the  FBI  letters  led  to  some  inconsistency  in  the  \ninformation  provided  to  victims  concerning  their  CVRA  rights.    Beginning  in  2006,  the  FBI  provided  to  victims  \nstandard  letters  advising  victims  of  their  CVRA  rights  but  which  also  noted  that  only  some  of  the  rights  applied  \npre-charge.  During this period, Villafaña also crafted her own introductory letters to the victims to let them know of \ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation \nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Attorney’s Office.”  Villafaña told \nOPR  that  in  a  case  in  which  she  “need[ed]  to  be  talking  to  young  girls  frequently  and  asking  them  really  intimate  \nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.”  Villafaña’s letter itemized the CVRA \nrights, but it did not explain that those rights attached only after a formal charge had been made.  The letter was hand \n\n \n263 \n \nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the \nFBI  Letters  Were  Accurate  but  Risked  Misleading  Victims  regarding  the  \nStatus of the Federal Investigation \n  As  described  previously,  given  Epstein’s  appeal  to  the  Department  and  continued  delay  \nentering his guilty plea, Villafaña and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to \ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein.  By April \n2008, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.”\n \n As a result, \nVillafaña  and  the  case  agents  continued  their  efforts  to  prepare  for  a  likely  trial  with  additional  \ninvestigative steps.  Among other actions, Villafaña, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents \nengaged in the following investigative activities:  \n \nx The  FBI  interviewed  victims  in  October  and  November  2007  and  between  January  and  \nMay 2008, and discovered at least six new victims.   \nx In  January  2008,  CEOS  assigned  a  Trial  Attorney  to  bring  expertise  and  “a  national  \nperspective” to the matter. \nx In  January  and  February  2008,  Villafaña  and  the  CEOS  Trial  Attorney  participated  in  \nvictim interviews. \nx Villafaña revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknown to \nEpstein’s counsel.”   \nx The  USAO  informed  the  Department’s  Civil  Rights  Division  “pursuant  to  USAM  \n[§]  8-3.120,”  of  the  USAO’s  “ongoing  investigation  of  a  child  exploitation  matter”  \ninvolving Epstein and others.\n \n \nx Villafaña secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being \nsought by Epstein’s attorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.\n413\n \nx Villafaña prepared a revised draft indictment. \nx Villafaña  sought  and  obtained  approval  to  provide  immunity  to  a  potential  government  \nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony. \nx Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 30, 2008, Villafaña took steps to \nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead guilty. \nVillafaña told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim letter that the \ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.”  Similarly, the FBI case agent told \nOPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was \n                                                 \ndelivered, along with the FBI’s own victim’s rights pamphlet and notification letter, to victims following their FBI \ninterviews.   \n413\n  According to the 2017 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case attorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that \nVillafaña secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”   \n\n \n264 \n \ncontinuing.”  The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2019, \nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut down.”   \n OPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim letters were drafted with the intent to mislead \nthe  victims  about  the  status  of  the  federal  investigation.    The  “ongoing  investigation”  language  \ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical \nto  that  contained  in  standard  form  notification  letters  the  FBI  generated  and  distributed  from  \nAugust  2006  through  the  2007  signing  of  the  NPA.\n414\n    Nevertheless,  the  FBI’s  letters  omitted  \nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a \nfederal  prosecution  would  go  forward  only  if  Epstein  failed  to  fulfill  his  obligations  under  an  \nagreement  he  had  reached  with  the  USAO.    Victims  receiving  the  FBI’s  letter  would  logically  \nconclude  that  the  federal  government  was  continuing  to  gather  evidence  to  support  a  federal  \nprosecution.  CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of \nthis letter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving \nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her.  Furthermore, when the \nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2007 eventually came \nto light, the statement in the subsequent letters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions \nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.   \n  In  sum,  OPR  concludes  that  the  statement  in  the  FBI  victim  letters  that  the  matter  was  \n“currently  under  investigation”  was  not  false  because  the  USAO  and  the  FBI  did  continue  to  \ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein.  The letters, however, risked misleading the \nvictims,  and  contributed  to  victim  frustration  and  confusion,  because  the  letters  did  not  provide  \nimportant  information  that  would  have  advised  victims  of  the  actual  status  of  the  investigation.    \nNonetheless,  OPR  found  no  evidence  that  Villafaña  or  her  supervisors  participated  in  drafting  \nthose letters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s letters until the Department gathered them \nfor  production  in  the  CVRA  litigation.    The  use  of  FBI  form  letters  that  gave  incomplete  \ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the \nfederal  agencies  responsible  for  communicating  with  Epstein’s  victims  and  showed  a  lack  of  \nattention to and oversight regarding communication with victims.  Despite the fact that the case \nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form letters continued to be \nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information \nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.\n415\n          \n                                                 \n414\n  The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System \nindicates that letters the FBI system generated in 2006 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial \n(Investigative  Agency)”  and  “Under  Investigation”  and  letters  generated  in  2008  contained  stock  language  for  the  \nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.” \n415\n    After  Epstein  entered  his  guilty  pleas,  the  FBI  sent  a  similar  form  letter  requesting  “assistance  and  \ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States. \n\n \n265 \n \nIV. ACOSTA’S    DECISION    TO    DEFER    TO    THE    STATE    ATTORNEY’S    \nDISCRETION  WHETHER  TO  NOTIFY  VICTIMS  ABOUT  EPSTEIN’S  STATE  \nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS \nSTANDARD;   HOWEVER,   ACOSTA   EXERCISED   POOR   JUDGMENT   BY   \nFAILING   TO   ENSURE   THAT   VICTIMS   IDENTIFIED   IN   THE   FEDERAL   \nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING \nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became \nclear  that  the  defense  team  disagreed  with,  and  strongly  objected  to,  the  government’s  plan  to  \ninform  victims  of  their  ability  to  recover  monetary  damages  from  Epstein,  under  the  18  U.S.C.  \n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing.  The USAO initially \ntook  the  position  that  it  was  obligated  to,  and  intended  to,  inform  victims  of  both  the  NPA,  \nincluding  the  §  2255  provision,  and  Epstein’s  change  of  plea  hearing  and  sentencing,  so  that  \nvictims who wanted to attend could do so.   \nIn  November  and  December  2007,  Epstein’s  attorneys  challenged  the  USAO’s  position  \nregarding victim notification.  Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim \nnotifications.  Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected \nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing \npursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights requirements.  Acosta also determined that the USAO \nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255, \na  decision  that  was  implemented  by  letters  sent  to  victims  after  Epstein  entered  his  state  pleas.    \nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas, \nwas  based,  at  least  in  part,  on  Villafaña’s  and  the  case  agents’  strategic  concerns  relating  to  \npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, below.   \nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for \nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing.  OPR concludes that neither the CVRA \nnor  the  VRRA  required  the  government  to  notify  victims  of  the  state  proceeding  and  therefore  \nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State \nAttorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing.  However, OPR \nalso  concludes  that  Acosta  exercised  poor  judgment  because  by  failing  to  ensure  that  the  state  \nintended  to  and  would  notify  victims  of  the  federal  investigation,  he  failed  to  treat  victims  \nforthrightly  and  with  the  sensitivity  expected  by  the  Department.    Through  counsel,  Acosta  \n“strongly  disagree[d]”  with  OPR’s  conclusion  and  argued  that  OPR  unfairly  applied  a  standard  \n“never  before  expected  of  any  U.S.  Attorney.”    OPR  addresses  Acosta’s  criticisms  in  the  \ndiscussion below.   \nA. Acosta’s  Decision  to  Defer  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Discretion  Whether  to  \nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any \nClear or Unambiguous Standard \n  In  November  2007,  Villafaña  sought  to  avoid  defense  accusations  of  misconduct  \nconcerning  her  interactions  with  the  victims  by  preparing  a  written  notice  to  victims  informing  \nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting \nthem to appear at the state plea hearing.  Villafaña and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft letter \nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense attorney Lefkowitz, who, in turn, \n\n \n266 \n \nstrongly  objected  to  the  government’s  plan  to  notify  victims  of  the  state  proceedings,  which  he  \ndescribed  as  “highly  inappropriate”  and  an  “intrusion  into  state  affairs,  when  the  identified  \nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”  \n Thereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafaña \ndrafted,  and  Sloman  signed,  the  December  6,  2007  letter  to  Lefkowitz  rejecting  the  defense  \narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in \nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing.  The letter took an expansive \nview  of  the  applicable  statutes  by  contending  that  both  the  CVRA  and  the  VRRA  required  the  \nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings: \n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district \ncourt.      Our   Non-Prosecution   Agreement   resolves   the   federal   \ninvestigation  by  allowing  Mr.  Epstein  to  plead  to  a  state  offense.    \nThe  victims  identified  through  the  federal  investigation  should  be  \nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does \nnot  require  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  to  forego  [sic]  its  legal  \nobligations.\n416\n \nThe  letter  also  asserted  that  the  VRRA  obligated  the  USAO  to  provide  the  victims  with  \ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice \nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea.  Along with \nthe  letter,  Sloman  forwarded  a  revised  draft  victim  notification  letter  to  Lefkowitz  for  his  \ncomments.    This  draft  victim  notification  letter  stated  that  the  federal  investigation  had  been  \ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend 18 months of \nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims \nbrought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.  The draft victim notification letter provided specific information \nconcerning  the  upcoming  change  of  plea  hearing  and  invited  the  victims  to  attend  or  provide  a  \nwritten statement to the State Attorney’s Office.  When Lefkowitz asked Sloman to delay sending \nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafaña, who was \npreparing  letters  for  transmittal  to  30  victims,  to  “Hold  the  letter.”    During  his  OPR  interview,  \nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the letter out,” but he “must have had a conversation \nwith  somebody”  about  whether  the  CVRA  applied,  and  based  on  that  conversation  he  directed  \nVillafaña to hold the letter.  \nIn   his   response   letter   to   Acosta,   Lefkowitz   contended   that   the   government   had   \nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in \nthis matter [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”  \n                                                 \n416\n    Sloman  told  Lefkowitz  the  USAO  did  not  seek  to  “federalize”  a  state  plea,  but  “is  simply  informing  the  \nvictims of their rights.”  Sloman also addressed the defense attorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could \ncontact Villafaña or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal \nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in this case.’”   \n\n \n267 \n \nThereafter,  in  his  December  19,  2007  letter  to  defense  counsel  mainly  addressing  other  \nmatters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Attorney’s discretion \nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing: \nI  understand  that  the  defense  objects  to  the  victims  being  given  \nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and] \nsentencing   hearing.      I   have   reviewed   the   proposed   victim   \nnotification letter and the statute.  I would note that the United States \nprovided  the  draft  letter  to  the  defense  as  a  courtesy.    In  addition,  \nFirst Assistant United States Attorney Sloman already incorporated \nin the letter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.  \nI agree that Section 3771 applies to notice of proceedings and results \nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.  We \nintend  to  provide  victims  with  notice  of  the  federal  resolution,  as  \nrequired by law.  We will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney \nregarding  whether  he  wishes  to  provide  victims  with  notice  of  the  \nstate   proceedings,   although   we   will   provide   him   with   the   \ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.   \n(Emphasis added.) \nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [letter] without running it by [Sloman], \nif not other individuals in the office.”  Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State \nAttorney, or for our office to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to \nthe state outcome.”  Acosta acknowledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s \nhandling  of  the  case,  but  he  told  OPR,  “that  doesn’t  mean  that  they  will  not  fulfill  whatever  \nobligation they have.  Let’s not assume. . . that the State Attorney’s office is full of bad actors.” \nSloman  initially  believed  that  “the  victims  were  going  to  be  notified  at  some  level,  especially  \nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was \nan agreement made that we were going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to \ndecide how the victims were going to be notified.”\n417\n  Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding \nunder  the  belief  that  we  were  going  to  notify  the  victims,”  even  though  “this  was  not  a  federal  \ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if \nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . . . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be \ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n \n  OPR  could  not  determine  whether  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  notified  any  victims  in  \nadvance of the June 30, 2008 state plea hearing.  Krischer told OPR that the State Attorney’s Office \nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether \nor how it was used in the Epstein case.  Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether \nvictims  were  notified  of  the  hearing  nor  whether  the  state  law  required  notification  for  the  \n                                                 \n417\n    Sloman  stated  in  his  June  3,  2008  letter  to  Deputy  Attorney  General  Filip  that  Acosta  made  the  decision  \ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker.  Acosta did consult \nwith  Mandelker  about  the  §  2255  civil  damages  recovery  process,  but  neither  Acosta  nor  Mandelker  recalled  \ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played \na role in the deferral decision.   \n\n \n268 \n \nparticular charges and victims at issue.  Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafaña to \ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2008, she reported back \nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”\n418\n  Villafaña recalled that she \nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said \nhe would “contact as many as he could.”  The contemporaneous records do not show how many \nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom.  No victim \nwho  provided  information  to  OPR,  either  in  person  or  through  her  attorney,  recalled  receiving  \nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials.  At the time Epstein pled guilty in state \ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Attorney’s Office had \nnotified about the proceeding.  Accordingly, Villafaña, who was present in the courtroom for the \nhearing, had no knowledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims \nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”\n419\n   \nOPR  considered  whether  Acosta’s  decision  to  defer  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  the  \ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional \nmisconduct.  OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring \nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled \nto attend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.  \nFurthermore,  as  discussed  previously,  OLC  had  issued  guidance  stating  that  the  CVRA  did  not  \napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.\n420\n  Moreover, the section of the VRRA \nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to attend” referred specifically to \nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § 10606(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become \npart of the CVRA (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)).\n421\n \nBecause  Acosta  had  no  clear  or  unambiguous  duty  to  inform  victims  identified  in  the  \nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State \nAttorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing \nso did not constitute professional misconduct.\n422\n   \n                                                 \n418\n  Sloman replied, “Good.”  In her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated, “I requested permission to make \noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification \ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”     \n419\n  Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.  \n420\n    OLC  2005  CVRA  Informal  Guidance;  see  also  United  States  v.  Guevara-Toloso,  No. 04-1455, 2005 WL \n1210982, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 23, 2005) (in case involving a federal charge of illegal entry after a felony conviction, \nthe court determined that victims of the predicate state conviction were not victims under the CVRA). \n421\n  In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel noted that the petitioner argued “only in passing” that the government \nviolated her CVRA right “to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding . . . involving the \ncrime”;  however,  the  court  concluded  this  provision  “clearly  appl[ies]  only  after  the  initiation  of  criminal  \nproceedings.”  Wild, 955 F.3d at 1205 n.7, 1208.     \n422\n  The government’s letter to victims, following Epstein’s guilty pleas, informing them of the resolution of the \ncase  by  state  plea  and  the  availability  of  §  2255  relief,  also  appear  to  satisfy  the  potentially  applicable  VRRA  \nrequirements to “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and  to “provide \na victim the earliest possible notice of the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to \n\n \n269 \n \nB. Acosta  Exercised  Poor  Judgment  When  He  Failed  to  Ensure  That  Victims  \nIdentified  in  the  Federal  Investigation  Were  Informed  of  the  State  Plea  \nHearing  \nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the \nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that \nthe  federal  investigation  had  been  resolved  through  an  agreement  that  included  pleas  to  state  \ncharges.    As  the  contemporary  records  indicate,  Acosta  consistently  expressed  hesitancy  to  \ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney.  His decision that the \nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Attorney’s \njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view.  However, OPR \nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State \nAttorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that \nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the \nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims \nthat  it  did  notify  that  the  state  plea  hearing  was  part  of  an  agreement  that  resolved  the  federal  \ninvestigation into their own cases.\n423\n \nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to \ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem \nfrom  passing  the  task  of  notifying  victims  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  and  made  appropriate  \nefforts  to  ensure  that  those  problems  were  minimized.    Appropriate  notification  would  have  \nincluded  advising  victims  identified  in  the  federal  investigation  that  the  USAO  had  declined  to  \nbring charges and that the matter was being handled by the State Attorney, and, at a minimum, \nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information.  Acosta could have interacted with \nthe State Attorney, or instructed Villafaña or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make \nnotifications  in  a  way  that  reached  the  most  possible  victims  and  that  it  had  the  information  \nnecessary to accomplish the task.  Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification \nentirely  to  the  State  Attorney’s  discretion  without  providing  that  office  with  the  names  of  \nindividuals  the  USAO  believed  were  victims  and,  apparently,  without  even  informing  the  state  \nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.   \nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming \nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge \ninvolved  three  separate  victims,  there  were  thus  only  at  most  four  victims  of  the  charged  state  \noffenses.  Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining \nwhether  the  state  intended  to  notify  more  than  those  few  victims.    Moreover,  the  federal  \ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by \n                                                 \ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.”  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 10607(c)(1)(B) \nand (c)(3)(A).   \n423\n    Through  counsel,  Acosta  argued  that  OPR’s  criticism  of  him  for  “electing  to  ‘defer’  the  notification  \nobligation  to  the  state”  was  inappropriate  and  “a  non  sequitur”  because  “where  no  federal  notification  obligation  \nexists, it cannot be deferred.”  OPR’s criticism, as explained further below, is not with the decision itself, but rather \nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed \nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without \nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.            \n\n \n270 \n \nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct.  Absent information from the USAO, \nthe  state  would  not  have  been  in  a  position  to  notify  those  additional  victims  of  the  state  plea  \nproceeding, even if the State Attorney had decided to include other victims identified during the \nstate investigation.  Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised \nby  Villafaña  that  Belohlavek,  in  November  2007,  had  requested  that  the  USAO  notify  victims,  \npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing. \nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the \nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak.  Acosta \nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was \nnot proceeding.”  There is no evidence, however, that he verified this understanding with Sloman \nor  Villafaña,  let  alone  the  State  Attorney.    OPR  found  no  indication  that  Acosta  ever  \ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafaña to communicate, his decision to the State Attorney \nor  to  provide  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  with  a  complete  list  of  victims  identified  during  the  \nfederal  investigation.    OPR  located  a  draft  letter  to  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  that  Villafaña  \nprepared  and  forwarded  to  Acosta  in  December  2007,  which  did  provide  such  information,  but  \nOPR  found  no  evidence  that  the  letter  was  ever  sent,  and  it  was  not  among  materials  publicly  \nreleased  from  the  State  Attorney’s  Office.\n424\n    OPR  also  found  evidence  that  both  Sloman  and  \nVillafaña interacted with the State Attorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 30, 2008 \nplea  hearing,  but  there  is  no  indication  that  they  discussed  victim  notification  issues  with  that  \noffice, and Villafaña’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that \nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Attorney’s Office.  Belohlavek told OPR that no one \nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to \nappear at the hearing.    \nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it \nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding.  In the absence of some \ndiscussion of which or how many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to \ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea \nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.  \nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for how all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both \nfederal  and  state,  “would  be  aware  of  what  was  happening  in  the  state  court  and  have  an  \nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” \nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the \nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately \nwas not unsupported.  State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the \nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources, \nand  processes  to  help  accomplish  notification.    However,  Acosta  was  aware—through  the  \nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafaña—that the \nUSAO’s  investigation  had  expanded  beyond  those  victims  identified  in  the  original  PBPD  \n                                                 \n424\n  The text of the letter indicated that Epstein’s attorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights \nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Attorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the \nState Attorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with \nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”   \n\n \n271 \n \ninvestigation.  Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than \nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO \nwas  certain  which  victims  were  covered  by  the  state  charges,  it  should  have  been  apparent  to  \nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, there \nwas  a  substantial  risk  that  most  of  the  victims  identified  in  the  federal  investigation  would  not  \nreceive notice of the hearing.\n425\n  Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims \ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and \nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant \nissues  relating  to  Epstein.    Villafaña  and  Sloman’s  hastily  arranged  effort  to  enlist  in  the  \nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played little role in complying with the state’s \nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning \nand coordination with the State Attorney’s Office.\n426\n   \nEven if the State Attorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming \nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that \nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation \nas well.  The State Attorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status \nof  the  federal  investigation,  and  there  was  little  reason  to  assume  Krischer,  or  one  of  his  staff,  \nwould  voluntarily  do  so,  thereby  putting  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  in  the  position  of  fielding  \nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome.  Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense \nhad  differing  views  as  to  who  could  lawfully  participate  in  the  state  plea  hearing,  there  is  no  \nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaña took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they \ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged \ncrimes.\n427\n  \nThrough  counsel,  Acosta  asserted  to  OPR  that  because  Villafaña  and  Sloman  both  told  \nOPR  that  they  believed  that  state  officials  would  notify  the  victims,  “OPR  identified  no  reason  \nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.”  Acosta’s counsel further \n                                                 \n425\n      Krischer  told  OPR  that  the  state’s  notification  obligation  extended  to  all  victims  identified  in  the  state  \ninvestigation.  Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear.  The PBPD’s \nprobable   cause   affidavit   included   crimes   against   only   5   victims,   not   the   19   identified   in   the   state   \ninvestigation.  According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims.  After \nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification letters to only 2 victims.  Belohlavek told OPR that because of the \nnature of the charges, she did not know whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required \nto notify of the plea hearing.   \n426\n      The  State  Attorney’s  Office  had  its  own  procedures  and  employees  who  handled  victim  notification,  and  \nBelohlavek  told  OPR  that  the  Chief  of  the  Police  Department  would  not  regularly  play  a  role  in  the  state  victim  \nnotification process.   \n427\n  Although Villafaña’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 960.001 and 921.143 when she \ndrafted unsent letters to victims in November and December 2007 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing \npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been allowed to participate in \nthe state plea hearing.  In Lefkowitz’s November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right \nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant \nwas being sentenced.  In April 2008, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that \nFlorida Statute § 921.143(l) did not allow the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.  The court \nruled that § 921.143(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.720(b) allows trial courts to consider at \nsentencing hearings.”  Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008).   \n\n \n272 \n \nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification \ntask,  and  thus  had  no  responsibility  to  personally  confirm  that  Chief  Reiter  would  notify  the  \nvictims of the hearing.\n428\n  Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management \nplayed  no  role  in  the  victim  notification  process;  however,  in  this  case,  the  issue  of  victim  \nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the \ndefense.    Acosta  personally  involved  himself  by  resolving  the  notification  dispute  with  defense  \ncounsel  in  his  December  19,  2007  letter.    Villafaña  provided  Acosta  with  a  draft  letter  to  state  \nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified \nin the federal investigation.  OPR found no evidence, however, that Acosta sent the letter or any \nsimilar communication to the State Attorney’s Office or that he provided Villafaña and Sloman \nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December 19, \n2007 letter.  Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to \nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the \nstate process.             \nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a letter \nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some \nvictims  only  learned  of  the  state  court  pleas  and  sentencing  from  the  news  media.    In  the  end,  \nalthough  Villafaña  and  Sloman  hastily  attempted  to  ensure  victim  notification  through  Chief  \nReiter, their effort was too little and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to attend \nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their own cases.\n429\n  \nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for \nnotifying victims to the State Attorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.  \nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta \npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the \nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.  \nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe \nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware \nof the state court proceeding.  Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s \nconduct,  ensuring  that  the  victims  were  notified  of  the  state  plea  hearing  would  have  been  \nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity, \nand sensitivity.  Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the \n                                                 \n428\n  As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of \npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before \nexpected  of  any  US  Attorney,”  and  inappropriately  criticizes  Acosta  for  “not  personally  confirming  that  the  State  \nAttorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had \nactually  notified  the  victims.    For  the  reasons  discussed,  the  issue  is  not  whether  Acosta  “personally”  took  certain  \nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted \nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider how or even whether that entity would be able \nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.      \n429\n  OPR notes that Villafaña contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting \nwindow of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short.  Had the USAO coordinated with the State Attorney \nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that \nthe State Attorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and \nthat  issues  concerning  the  victims’  appearance  at  the  hearing  were  appropriately  considered  by  state  authorities.    \nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the \nmonths that the matter was under review by the Department.   \n\n \n273 \n \nresolution  of  the  case  to  ensure  Epstein’s  victims  were  given  an  opportunity  to  attend  the  plea  \nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast \nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s attorneys, which included the unusual \ncourtesy of allowing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications.  This \ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the \npublic.   \nNothing  in  the  documentary  record  suggests  that  Acosta  thought  through  the  issue  of  \ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that \nall of the known federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.  Instead, as with \nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised \npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims, \nbut  also  failed  to  consider  the  full  consequences  of  those  decisions  or  what  was  needed  to  \nimplement them.  Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility \nfor making notifications entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO \nand  the  Department  as  a  whole.    It  left  victims  in  the  dark  about  an  important  proceeding  that  \nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with \nvictims for months.  It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally \nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state \nproceeding.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to attend a hearing \nthat  was  related  to  their  own  cases  and  thus  failed  to  ensure  that  victims  were  treated  with  \nforthrightness and dignity.  \nV.  VILLAFAÑA  DID  NOT  COMMIT  PROFESSIONAL  MISCONDUCT  IN  HER  \nORAL  COMMUNICATIONS  TO  VICTIMS  AND  VICTIMS’  ATTORNEYS,  IN  \nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID \nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS \n From September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 30, 2008 \nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafaña’s direction, directly informed only three \nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the \nfederal  investigation  would  be  closed.    During  this  time  period,  Villafaña  and  the  case  agents  \ninteracted  with  several  victims  and  their  attorneys,  and  Villafaña  contacted  victims’  attorney  \nBradley Edwards to encourage him to attend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform \nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.    \n As described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and \nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.\n430\n  After speaking to three victims, however, \nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary \ndamages  provision  would  create  potential  impeachment  material  for  the  victims  and  the  agent  \nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.  As the case agent \ntold  OPR,  “I  would  .  .  .  have  to  testify  that  I  told  every  one  of  these  girls  that  they  could  sue  \nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.”  The case \n                                                 \n430\n  Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to \nVillafaña from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that \nshe was unhappy with the resolution.    \n\n \n274 \n \nagent  and  Villafaña  consulted  with  the  USAO’s  Professional  Responsibility  Officer  about  the  \nmatter,  and  thereafter  stopped  notifying  the  victims  about  the  NPA  and  their  ability  to  pursue  \nmonetary damages according to its terms.  \n Villafaña advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment \nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] now, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are \nentitled  to  a  large  amount  of  damages  right?’”    Explaining  the  decision  in  her  later  CVRA  \ndeclaration,  Villafaña  said  that  after  Epstein’s  attorneys  “complained  that  the  victims  were  \nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their \ndamages  claims,”  she  “concluded  that  informing  additional  victims  could  compromise  the  \nwitnesses’  credibility  at  trial  if  Epstein  reneged  on  the  agreement.”    Acosta  was  aware  of  these  \nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2008 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the \nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses.  Epstein argued very forcefully that they \nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a] \nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”   \n The case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2007, but did not inform \nthem  about  the  NPA.\n431\n    On  January  31,  2008,  the  FBI  agents,  Villafaña,  and  the  CEOS  Trial  \nAttorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one \nmore  victim  the  next  day.\n432\n    Wild  and  two  others  had  been  contacted  by  the  FBI  in  the  fall  of  \n2007 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.   \n Villafaña told OPR that during the January 31, 2008 interviews, she did not specifically \ntell  the  victims  that  “there  was  a  signed  non-prosecution  agreement  that  had  these  terms.”    She  \nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand \nwhat that means.”  Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafaña, had been \ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where \n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually \nperform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”  \nVillafaña recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court” \nthat  would  end  the  investigation,  but  she  did  not  recall  distinguishing  between  the  “federal  \ninvestigation versus a state investigation.”  Villafaña told OPR she explained “the case was under \ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that \ncharges would be brought.”  An email from Villafaña to Sloman and Acosta during this time period \nreflects  that  she  had  such  discussions  with  at  least  one  victim  interviewed  on  this  date:    “The  \nsecond  girl  .  .  .  was  very  upset  about  the  18  month  deal  she  had  read  about  in  the  paper.  .  .  .    \n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.”  Villafaña, \nhowever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather, \nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.  In her own 2015 CVRA- \ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of \n                                                 \n431\n  FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2008, without prosecutors, and did not inform the \nvictims of the NPA.  \n432\n  Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, but the evidence is unclear as \nto whether the interviews occurred.   \n\n \n275 \n \nthe  federal  investigation  I  was  cooperating  in.    If  I  had  been  told  of  a[n  NPA],  I  would  have  \nobjected.”  Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me, \nI thought they were still investigating my case.”    \nNeither the CEOS Trial Attorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim \ninterviews.  The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited \nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of \nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n433\n   \n When asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when \nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafaña told OPR that \nshe  believed  she  and  the  agents  were  conducting  an  investigation  because  they  continued  \n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.  \nAs  Villafaña  stated,  “So  to  me,  saying  to  a  victim  the  case  is  now  back  under  investigation  is  \nperfectly accurate.” \nVillafaña was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with \ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ attorneys about the NPA.  \nIn a 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ attorney Bradley Edwards alleged that \nduring  telephone  calls  with  Villafaña,  he  “asked  very  specific  questions  about  what  stage  the  \ninvestigation was in,” and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because the \nmatter  “was  an  on-going  active  investigation.”    Edwards  stated  that  Villafaña  gave  him  “the  \nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, \nboth  in  the  number  of  identified  victims  and  complexity.”    Edwards  also  stated,  “A  fair  \ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafaña \nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n \n  \nIn her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke” \nduring  her  interactions  with  Edwards  and  that  due  to  the  “uncertainty  of  the  situation”  and  the  \npossibility  of  a  trial,  she  “did  not  feel  comfortable  sharing  any  information  about  the  case.”    \nVillafaña  also  told  OPR  that  because  of  “all  of  these  concerns  and  instructions  that  I  had  been  \ngiven  by  Alex  [Acosta]  and  Jeff  [Sloman]  not  to  disclose  things  further  and  not  to  have  any  \ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information \nto Edwards. \n  Sloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO \nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to \nbreak down and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses \nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $150,000, that’s . . . \ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”\n434 \n Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did \n                                                 \n433\n  As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to \nbe prosecuted.  \n434\n    When  asked  why  the  USAO  did  not  simply  notify  the  victims  of  the  change  of  plea  hearing,  Sloman  \nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.  I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly \ninterested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.”  \n\n \n276 \n \nnot plead guilty in October 2007 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether \nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here \nhas to be discretion to judge how much you can tell the victims and when.”   \n  Epstein’s  attorneys’  conduct  during  the  period  between  the  signing  of  the  NPA  and  \nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafaña all \nidentified.  As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and \ncivil  cases  against  Epstein,  counsel  suggested  that  the  victims  were  motivated  to  testify  against  \nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain.  For example, during a February 20, 2008 \nstate  deposition  of  a  victim,  defense  counsel  asked  her  whether  the  federal  prosecutors  or  FBI  \nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.\n435\n  In her 2017 declaration in \nthe  CVRA  litigation,  Villafaña  identified  that  line  of  questioning  as  a  motivating  factor  in  the  \ngovernment’s  decision  to  stop  notifying  the  victims  about  the  potential  for  18  U.S.C.  §  2255  \nrecovery.    \n On June 27, 2008, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 30, 2008 state court guilty \nplea hearing, Villafaña contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.  Villafaña \ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s attorney other than Edwards \nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.\n436\n  In his 2017 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation, \nEdwards  stated  that  Villafaña  “gave  the  impression  that  she  was  caught  off-guard  herself  that  \nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”   \n Edwards said in a 2016 court filing that Villafaña told him only that “Epstein was pleading \nguilty  to  state  solicitation  of  prostitution  charges  involving  other  victims—not  Mr.  Edward’s  \nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.”  Villafaña stated in her 2017 declaration that \nshe “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the \nstate  court  charging  instrument  nor  the  factual  proffer  limited  the  procurement  of  prostitution  \ncharge  to  a  specific  victim.”    Villafaña  told  OPR  she  “strongly  encouraged  [Edwards]  and  his  \nclients to attend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized \nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.”  In his 2017 affidavit, Edwards acknowledged \nthat  “Villafaña  did  express  that  this  hearing  was  important,  but  never  told  me  why  she  felt  that  \nway.”  Edwards claimed that Villafaña’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court \nwould  bring  an  end  to  the  possibility  of  federal  prosecution  pursuant  to  the  plea  agreement”  \nresulted in his clients not attending the hearing.\n \n Edwards himself was out of town and not able to \n                                                 \n435\n  As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn \ninformation  concerning  the  federal  investigation  even  though  those  individuals  were  not  involved  in  the  state  \nprosecution.  For example, in a March 2008 email, Villafaña informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who \nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you know, doesn’t involve most \nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).”  Villafaña further observed that because Epstein \nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim] \nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”      \n436\n    Villafaña’s  June  30,  2008  handwritten  notes  reflect  that,  at  the  time  of  Epstein’s  state  court  guilty  plea,  \nVillafaña  was  aware  of  the  identities  of  a  least  five  other  attorneys  representing  Epstein’s  victims.    In  her  written  \nresponse  to  OPR,  Villafaña  stated,  “I  requested  permission  to  make  oral  notifications  to  the  victims  regarding  the  \nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator, \nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”  On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafaña emailed Sloman to inform \nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”  Sloman replied, “Good.”   \n\n \n277 \n \nattend the hearing.  In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have \nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that \nfederal investigation.”      \n            In            Wild,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  panel  stated  that  the  government  “seemingly”  deferred  to  \nEpstein’s  attorneys’  requests  not  to  notify  the  victims  about  the  NPA,  and  that  in  sending  the  \nJanuary and May 2008 FBI letters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive \nnondisclosure  to  (or  at  least  close  to)  active  misrepresentation.”\n437 \n  Although  both  the  appellate  \ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s letters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafaña, \nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether \nsimilar  representations  Villafaña  made  to  the  victims  whom  she  interviewed  on  January  31  and  \nFebruary  1,  2008,  and  to  Edwards,  were  misleading.    Therefore,  OPR  considered  whether  \nVillafaña’s statements that the matter was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the \nvictims  whom  she  interviewed  or  Edwards  about  the  NPA  violated  FRPC  4-4.1(a),  4-8.4(c),  or  \n4-8.4(d). \nFRPC  4-4.1(a)  prohibits  an  attorney  from  “knowingly  mak[ing]  a  false  statement  of  \nmaterial  fact  or  law  to  a  third  person”  during  the  representation  of  a  client.    The  FRPC  defines  \n“knowingly”  as  “denot[ing]  actual  knowledge  of  the  fact  in  question”  and  states  that  such  \nknowledge  may  be  “inferred  from  circumstances.”\n438\n    The  comment  to  FRPC  4-4.1  states  that  \n“[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that \nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.”  The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[f]or \ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.”  Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8.4(c) \nrequires  evidence  that  the  attorney  knew  the  statement  in  question  was  false.    Under  FRPC  \n4-8.4(c),  the  intent  requirement  can  be  satisfied  “merely  by  showing  that  the  conduct  was  \ndeliberate  or  knowing”  and  the  “motive  underlying  the  lawyer’s  conduct  is  not  determinative;  \ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”\n439\n  In Feinberg, the court concluded that \nthe  prosecutor  violated  FRPC  4-4.1  and  4-8.4(c)  and  (d)  by  deliberately  making  untruthful  \nstatements  to  a  defense  attorney,  despite  evidence  that  the  prosecutor  intended  to  help  the  \ndefendant by making the statements.\n440\n  In this case, Villafaña was fully aware of the signed NPA \nwhen  she  interviewed  the  victims  on  January  31  and  February  1,  2008,  and  when  she  spoke  to  \nEdwards  on  the  telephone,  but  she  did  not  inform  them  specifically  of  the  signed  NPA.    The  \nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knowing false statement or misrepresentation. \n  One  difficulty  is  determining  what  Villafaña  actually  said  during  conversations  that  \nparticipants were asked to recall many years later.  With respect to three of the victims whom she \ninterviewed in January and February 2008, Villafaña contended that she discussed the agreement \nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as \n                                                 \n437\n  Wild, 955 F.3d at 1199-1200. \n438\n  See R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-Preamble: A Lawyer’s Responsibilities, “Terminology.” \n439\n  Florida Bar v. Schwartz, 284 So. 3d 393, 396 (Fla. 2019) (citing Florida Bar v. Berthiaume, 78 So. 3d 503, \n510 n.2 (Fla. 2011); Florida Bar v. Riggs, 944 So. 2d 167, 171 (Fla. 2006); Florida Bar v. Smith, 866 So. 2d 41, 46 \n(Fla. 2004)). \n440\n  Florida Bar v. Feinberg, 760 So. 2d 933, 937-38 (Fla. 2000). \n\n \n278 \n \npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion.  Villafaña’s \nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to \napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.   \nNevertheless, Villafaña did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms \nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s \nattorney.  OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of \nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC \n4-4.1 or 4-8.4.\n441\n   \nOPR evaluated Villafaña’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.1:   \nA  lawyer  is  required  to  be  truthful  when  dealing  with  others  on  a  \nclient’s  behalf,  but  generally  has  no  affirmative  duty  to  inform  an  \nopposing party of relevant facts.  A misrepresentation can occur if \nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that \nthe  lawyer  knows  is  false.  Misrepresentations  can  also  occur  by  \npartially  true  but  misleading  statements  or  omissions  that  are  the  \nequivalent of affirmative false statements.   \nThe  victims  and  their  attorneys  were  certainly  not  “opposing  part[ies]”  to  the  USAO,  but  the  \ncomment  indicates  that  the  rule  recognizes  that  omissions  made  during  discussions  with  third  \nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.   \nHere,  the  evidence  does  not  show  that  Villafaña  knowingly  made  an  affirmative  false  \nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false \nstatements” about material facts.  First, Villafaña told OPR that she believed the investigation was \nongoing  and  her  statement  to  that  effect  truthful,  and  as  discussed  earlier  in  this  Chapter,  the  \nevidence  shows  that  Villafaña  and  the  agents  did  continue  to  investigate  the  case  until  Epstein  \nentered  his  guilty  plea  in  state  court  in  June  2008.    Villafaña’s  email  correspondence  with  her  \nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to \ncharge him.  The evidence similarly does not show that Villafaña knowingly made any affirmative \nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined \nto provide additional information in response to his questions.\n442\n    \nSecond,  in  reaching  its  conclusion,  OPR  considered  the  full  context  in  which  Villafaña  \ninteracted  with  the  victims  and  Edwards.    Prosecutors  routinely  make  decisions  about  what  \ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons.  In \nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses, \n                                                 \n441\n  In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.1(a) and 4-8.4(c) \n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].”  Florida Bar v. Joy, \n679  So.  2d  1165,  1166-68  (Fla.  1996).    See  also  Florida  Bar  re  Webster,  647  So.  2d  816  (Fla.  1994)  (petition  for  \nreinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).    \n442\n  In Feinberg, 760 So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Attorney lacked candor and violated \nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his attorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the \ndefense attorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.   \n\n \n279 \n \nand  they  often  cannot  fully  reveal  either  the  facts  or  the  status  of  an  investigation,  even  with  \nvictims.  The 2005 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited \nin their disclosures:  “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, \nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations \nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and \npublic information.”\n443 \n  \nVillafaña’s  concern  about  generating  potential  impeachment  evidence  by  informing  \nvictims  of  their  potential  to  recover  monetary  damages  from  Epstein  was  not  unreasonable.    \nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem, \nVillafaña  agreed  with  the  agents’  concerns.    Villafaña  raised  those  concerns  with  the  USAO’s  \nProfessional  Responsibility  Officer  in  October  2007  after  the  agents  brought  the  issue  to  her  \nattention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom \nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound.  OPR also considered that although \nVillafaña  had  sought  to  notify  the  victims  in  writing  of  the  NPA  soon  after  it  was  signed,  her  \nsupervisor, the U.S. Attorney, had decided otherwise.  When authorized to inform Edwards of the \nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so.  Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea \nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not show \nthat Villafaña acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from attending the \nhearing.  Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to \ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from attending the state proceedings.  \nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafaña told him the hearing was “important.”  Villafaña sought \nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) attendance at the state court \nplea,  while  obeying  her  management’s  directive  that  informing  victims  of  the  resolution  of  the  \nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n \n \nTherefore,  after  carefully  considering  all  of  the  circumstances,  OPR  concludes  that  the  \nevidence does not establish that Villafaña violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.1 or 4-8.4(c) \nor  (d).\n444    \nNonetheless,  as  discussed  below,  Villafaña’s  interactions  with  victims  and  victims’  \nattorneys  without  informing  them  of  the  NPA  and  the  potential  conclusion  of  the  federal  \ninvestigation  contributed  to  the  likelihood  that  the  victims  would  feel  that  the  government  was  \n                                                 \n443\n  2005 Guidelines, Art. IV, ¶ B.2.c(1).  As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein \nduring interviews with the government and they, or their attorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about \nthe  government’s  communications.    For  example,  within  a  day  of  Villafaña  contacting  a  victim’s  attorney  about  a  \npotential  victim  notification  letter,  Starr  complained  to  Acosta  that  the  government  had  recently  inappropriately  \nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl’s attorney, even though it was clear from the \ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.” \n444\n  The case most directly on point is Smith, 109 A.3d 1184, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed \na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the \nresolution of a sex abuse case.  However, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and \ncharged  before  entering  a  plea,  and  various  specific  statutes  afforded  victims  the  right  to  receive  notices  and  an  \nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.”  In this case, \nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafaña did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims \nor Edwards of the NPA.      \n\n \n280 \n \nintentionally  concealing  information  from  them  and  was  part  of  a  series  of  interactions  with  \nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.\n445\n   \nVI. THE  GOVERNMENT  FAILED  TO  TREAT  VICTIMS  FORTHRIGHTLY  AND  \nWITH  SENSITIVITY  WHEN  IT  FAILED  TO  TIMELY  PROVIDE  VICTIMS  \nWITH  IMPORTANT  INFORMATION  ABOUT  THE  RESOLUTION  OF  THE  \nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION   \n  Although  OPR  does  not  conclude  that  any  of  the  subjects  committed  professional  \nmisconduct,  either  by  failing  to  consult  with  the  victims  before  the  NPA  was  signed  or  in  \ninteractions  afterwards,  OPR’s  findings  are  not  an  endorsement  of  the  government’s  course  of  \naction.  The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims, \nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully attempted to \njoin in the CVRA litigation.  As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the matter is \nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims.  It \nis  unfortunate,  and  appears  fundamentally  unfair  to  the  victims,  that  Acosta  and  Sloman  (after  \nMenchel  and  Lourie  departed)  took  the  unusual  step  of  deciding  to  vet  the  USAO  victim  \nnotification  letters  with  the  defense  after  the  NPA  was  signed,  but  failed  to  go  beyond  the  \nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2005 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was \nsigned.  This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2005 Guidelines, that \nDepartment  employees  work  to  “minimize  the  frustration  and  confusion  that  victims  of  crime  \nendure in its wake.”  When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims, \nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by \nthe Department. \n Wild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar \nto  and  generally  representative  of  the  government’s  interactions  with  other  Epstein  victims  and  \nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government.  Wild experienced \na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafaña and the \ncase  agents.    Wild  received  Villafaña’s  letter  in  June  2007  stating  inaccurately  that  she  was  a  \nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights.  She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2007 but was \nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea.  Shortly after the September 24, 2007 signing of \nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case.  Nonetheless, \non January 10, 2008, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights letter indicating that the case was under \ninvestigation  and  that  some  of  her  CVRA  rights  may  not  apply  until  after  the  defendant  was  \ncharged.  On January 31, 2008, Villafaña re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS attorney and \nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention \nthe  NPA,  although  she  may  have  mentioned  a  possible  resolution.    In  mid-June  2008,  when  \nEdwards  contacted  Villafaña  on  Wild’s  behalf,  Villafaña  informed  him  that  the  case  was  under  \ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA.  Just before Epstein’s June 30, 2008 state court plea, \n                                                 \n445\n    OPR  notes  that,  similar  to  Villafaña,  Sloman  interacted  with  a  victim’s  attorney  during  the  time  period  \nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea.  In January 2008, Sloman received a telephone call \nfrom  his  former  law  partner,  who  represented  one  of  the  victims  and  who  asked  Sloman  whether  the  federal  \ngovernment  could  bring  charges  against  Epstein.    Sloman,  concerned  about  the  potential  for  conflict  of  interest  \nallegations due to his prior business relations with the attorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.  \nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the attorney.     \n\n \n281 \n \nVillafaña informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the \nstate  pleas  would  resolve  the  federal  investigation.    Edwards  then  filed  the  CVRA  petition  and  \nlearned  about  the  NPA  signed  months  earlier  and  that  the  federal  investigation  of  Epstein  had  \nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas.  Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge \npermitted  it  in  August  2008  pursuant  to  a  protective  order.    After  considering  this  series  of  \ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and \nbelieving she had been misled.   \n  OPR  did  not  find  evidence  supporting  a  conclusion  that  Villafaña,  Acosta,  Sloman,  \nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the \nNPA from public scrutiny.  Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion \nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that victim consultation \nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to \nthe point when he left the USAO.  The evidence is clear that Villafaña sought at various points to \nconsult  with  and  to  notify  victims  about  the  details  of  the  NPA  but  was  constrained  before  the  \nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address \nthe  issue  after  it  was  raised,  and  after  the  signing  by  her  own  concern  about  creating  possible  \nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.    \n Nonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and \nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the better practice.  Before the NPA was signed, \nvictims  could  have  been  asked  for  their  views  about  the  general  terms  the  USAO  was  \ncontemplating  offering,  including  that  a  plea  to  state  charges  was  one  of  the  options  being  \nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share \ntheir  views  of  how  the  case  should  be  resolved.    Even  if  the  USAO  ultimately  determined  to  \nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and \nconcerns,  particularly  on  the  issue  of  punishment,  and  victims  would  have  felt  included  in  the  \nprocess.    OPR  found  no  evidence  that  the  benefits  of  victim  consultation  were  discussed  or  \nconsidered before the NPA was signed.    \nAfter  the  NPA  was  signed,  no  one  from  the  government  explained  the  agreement  to  the  \nmajority  of  the  victims  until  months  later  and  only  after  the  entry  of  Epstein’s  guilty  plea.    \nAlthough the evidence supports Villafaña’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that \nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA \nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider how the \ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of \nthe openness and fairness of the process.  As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed \nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”\n \n When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to \navoid  creating  impeachment  evidence,  Villafaña,  Sloman,  and  Acosta  do  not  appear  to  have  \ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did \nthey revisit the decision before Villafaña met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or \nspoke to Edwards or other attorneys representing victims.\n446\n  Furthermore, more attention needed \n                                                 \n446\n    It  is  not  at  all  clear  whether  a  court  would  have  permitted  impeachment  of  the  victims  concerning  one  \nprovision  in  a  plea  agreement  that  otherwise  could  not  be  used  as  evidence.    See Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  11(f)  (“The  \nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of \nEvidence  410.”).    In  any  case,  the  victims  could  have  been  impeached  regarding  the  possibility  of  their  obtaining  \nmonetary  damages  through  either  a  civil  suit  or  through  18  U.S.C. § 2255 (if Epstein were convicted after a trial), \n\n \n282 \n \nto  be  paid  to  the  FBI’s  communications  to  ensure  that  the  victims  were  receiving  accurate  and  \ntimely  information  that  was  consistent  with  the  status  of  the  case  and  with  the  USAO’s  \ncommunications with victims.\n447\n   \nThe decision not to inform victims and their attorneys about the existence of the NPA gave \nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel \nto  keep  the  agreement  secret  from  the  victims.    Moreover,  the  lack  of  openness  about  the  NPA  \ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the matter and \nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement.  The overall result of \nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and \nfrustrated,  failed  to  promote  their  healing  process,  and  resulted  in  extensive  public  criticism.    \nAlthough  OPR  credits  Villafaña’s  statements  that  she  wanted  to  go  beyond  her  obligations  in  \ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not \nprioritized by the USAO.  In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally \nhandled  by  staff  in  the  USAO  and  the  FBI  who  are  trained  and  have  expertise  in  dealing  with  \nvictims  and  other  witnesses.    However,  decisions  made  by  Acosta,  Sloman,  and  Villafaña  also  \ncontributed  to  the  problems.    The  government,  as  it  ultimately  acknowledged  in  the  CVRA  \nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified \nfashion.         \nOPR  recognizes  that  the  Epstein  investigation  occurred  soon  after  the  passage  of  the  \nCVRA.  In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar \nwith its provisions.  OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above \ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to \nensure  that  in  the  future,  Department  attorneys’  actions  promote  victim  inclusion  whenever  \npossible.\n448\n  For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO \nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO \nfailed  to  consider  that  in  a  case  involving  a  pre-charge  disposition,  the  victims  were  receiving  \ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.\n  In certain cases, such as the \nEpstein  case,  prosecutors  may  need  to  provide  more  oversight  when  multiple  Department  \ncomponents  are  communicating  with  victims  to  avoid  providing  confusing  and  contradictory  \nmessages.   \n \n \n                                                 \nindependent  of  the  NPA  provision.    OPR  also  notes  that  impeachment  regarding  the  NPA  provision  may  have  \npermitted the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement.  In other words, \nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the \ncase  agent’s  concerns  might  have  led  the  prosecutors  to  conclude  that  the  risk  of  the  information  being  used  to  \nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was low.     \n447\n  In addition to the FBI letters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can \nbe seen in letters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.  \nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the letters, it appears from the records \nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI letter stating that the case was under \ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO letter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s \nstate guilty plea. \n448\n  OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2011 Guidelines.     \n\n \n283 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n  In  November  2018,  the  Miami  Herald  published  an  extensive  investigative  report  about  \nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that \nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States \nand  foreign  locations,  had  coerced  girls  into  engaging  in  sexual  activity  with  him  at  his  Palm  \nBeach, Florida estate.  The Miami Herald reported that in 2007, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict  of  Florida,  R.  Alexander  Acosta,  entered  into  an  “extraordinary”  deal  with  Epstein  that  \npermitted  Epstein  to  avoid  federal  prosecution  and  a  potentially  lengthy  prison  sentence  by  \npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s \nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.     \nFollowing  the  Miami  Herald’s  report,  and  after  receiving  a  Congressional  request  to  \ninvestigate,  OPR  initiated  an  investigation  into  the  allegations  that  prosecutors  in  the  USAO  \nimproperly  resolved  the  federal  investigation  into  the  criminal  conduct  of  Jeffrey  Epstein  by  \nnegotiating and executing the NPA.  OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations \nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and \nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims.  In July 2008, a victim, later joined \nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition \nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA.  In February 2019, the district court found that the \ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the \nNPA.  The court also found that letters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed, \ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading. \n \nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands \nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components.  The records \nincluded emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials.  OPR also collected and reviewed \nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings, \ngrand  jury  transcripts,  and  grand  jury  audio  recordings;  examined  extensive  publicly  available  \ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media \nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case.  OPR conducted \nmore than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI \nadministrative  personnel;  current  and  former  USAO  staff  and  attorneys;  current  and  former  \nDepartment  attorneys  and  senior  managers;  and  the  former  State  Attorney  and  Assistant  State  \nAttorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein.  OPR also interviewed or received written \ninformation  from  several  victims  and  attorneys  representing  victims  concerning  victim  contacts  \nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.   \n \nOPR identified the following five former USAO attorneys as subjects of its investigation \nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case \nthrough  the  NPA  or  in  the  negotiations  leading  to  the  agreement:    former  U.S.  Attorney  \nR.  Alexander  Acosta,  and  former  AUSAs  Jeffrey  H.  Sloman,  Matthew  I.  Menchel,  Andrew  C.  \nLourie,  and  Ann  Marie  C.  Villafaña.    Each  subject  submitted  written  responses  detailing  their  \ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and \ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation.  OPR conducted extensive interviews of \nall five subjects.  The subjects also submitted comments on OPR’s draft report.  \n\n \n284 \n \nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various \ndecisions  and  events  and  assessed  that  conduct  pursuant  to  OPR’s  analytical  framework.    OPR  \nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through \na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that \nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA.  Although Acosta did \nnot  sign  the  NPA,  he  participated  in  its  drafting  and  approved  it,  with  knowledge  of  its  terms.    \nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other \nsubjects who implemented his decisions.  \n \nBased  on  its  extensive  investigation,  OPR  concludes  that  the  subjects  did  not  commit  \nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.  \nUnder  OPR’s  framework,  professional  misconduct  requires  a  finding  that  a  subject  attorney  \nintentionally  or  recklessly  violated  a  clear  and  unambiguous  standard  governing  the  conduct  at  \nissue.  OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on \nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.  Furthermore, none \nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.  \nAs the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and \nDepartment  policy  to  resolve  the  case  as  he  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate,  as  long  as  his  \ndecision  was  not  motivated  or  influenced  by  improper  factors.    Acosta’s  decision  to  decline  to  \ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not \nfind  evidence  that  his  decision  was  based  on  corruption  or  other  impermissible  considerations,  \nsuch  as  Epstein’s  wealth,  status,  or  associations.    Evidence  shows  that  Acosta  resisted  defense  \nefforts  to  have  the  matter  returned  to  the  state  for  whatever  result  state  authorities  deemed  \nappropriate,  and  he  refused  to  eliminate  the  incarceration  and  sexual  offender  registration  \nrequirements.  OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one \nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, \nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.  The contemporaneous records show \nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on \nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper \nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a \nstate-based  resolution.    Accordingly,  OPR  does  not  find  that  Acosta  engaged  in  professional  \nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other \nsubjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.   \nNevertheless,  OPR  concludes  that  Acosta’s  decision  to  resolve  the  federal  investigation  \nthrough  the  NPA  constitutes  poor  judgment.    Although  this  decision  was  within  the  scope  of  \nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA \nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its \ninvestigation of Epstein.  In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein \nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should \nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state \nauthorities by encouraging them to do more.  However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties \ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had \nno  authority;  he  resolved  the  federal  investigation  before  significant  investigative  steps  were  \ncompleted;  and  he  agreed  to  several  unusual  and  problematic  terms  in  the  NPA  without  the  \nconsideration  required  under  the  circumstances.    In  sum,  Acosta’s  application  of  federalism  \n\n \n285 \n \nprinciples  was  too  expansive,  his  view  of  the  federal  interest  in  prosecuting  Epstein  was  too  \nnarrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use \nthe NPA.  Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the \nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other \njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination \nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.  The NPA was a \nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.     \nOPR  further  concludes  that  none  of  the  subject  attorneys  committed  professional  \nmisconduct  with  respect  to  the  government’s  interactions  with  victims.    The  subjects  did  not  \nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into \nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation \nwithout a federal criminal charge.  Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department \ndid not interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the \nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before \ncriminal charges were brought.  In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation \nwas for the purpose of silencing victims.  Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series \nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of \nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is \ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims \nof a crime endure.  \n  OPR  determined  that  none  of  the  subjects  was  responsible  for  communications  sent  to  \ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that \nfailed to inform them of the NPA.  The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who \nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the \nFBI  when  communicating  with  victims,  and  were  not  drafted  or  reviewed  by  the  subjects.    \nMoreover,  the  statement  that  the  matter  was  “under  investigation”  was  not  false  because  the  \ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill \nthe terms of the NPA.  However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim \nfrustration  and  confusion  by  failing  to  provide  important  information  about  the  status  of  the  \ninvestigation.  The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies \nresponsible  for  communicating  with  Epstein’s  victims  and  showed  a  lack  of  attention  to  and  \noversight regarding communication with victims.     \nAfter  the  NPA  was  signed,  Acosta  elected  to  defer  to  the  State  Attorney  the  decision  \nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s own victim’s rights \nrequirements.    Although  Acosta’s  decision  was  within  his  authority  and  did  not  constitute  \nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to \nmake  certain  that  the  state  intended  to  and  would  notify  victims  identified  through  the  federal  \ninvestigation about the state plea hearing.  His decision left victims uninformed about an important \nproceeding  that  resolved  the  federal  investigation,  an  investigation  about  which  the  USAO  had  \ncommunicated  with  victims  for  months.    It  also  ultimately  created  the  misimpression  that  the  \nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims.  Acosta failed to ensure that victims were \nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure \nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.  \n\n \n286 \n \nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA \nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and \nconversations  with  victims’  attorneys  in  2008  do  not  constitute  professional  misconduct.    \nContemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating \nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him, \nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing \nvictims.    Nonetheless,  the  failure  to  reevaluate  the  strategy  prior  to  interviews  of  victims  and  \ndiscussions  with  victims’  attorneys  occurring  in  2008  led  to  interactions  that  contributed  to  \nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.      \nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims, \nOPR  concludes  that  the  government’s  lack  of  transparency  and  its  inconsistent  messages  led  to  \nvictims  feeling  confused  and  ill-treated  by  the  government;  gave  victims  and  the  public  the  \nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret \nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.  The \noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims \nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.  In sum, OPR concludes \nthat  the  victims  were  not  treated  with  the  forthrightness  and  sensitivity  expected  by  the  \nDepartment.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n287 \n \nMETHODOLOGY \n \nA. Document Review \nAs  referenced  in  the  Executive  Summary,  OPR  obtained  and  reviewed  hundreds  of  \nthousands  of  pages  of  documents  from  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  Southern  District  of  \nFlorida  (USAO),  other  U.S.  Attorney’s  offices,  the  FBI,  and  other  Department  components,  \nincluding  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Attorney  General,  the  Criminal  Division,  and  the  Executive  \nOffice for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA).  The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their \nsources, are set forth below. \n \n1. USAO Records \nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein \ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation.  The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of \nmaterial that Villafaña updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained \npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive \ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including letters and emails; evidence such \nas  telephone  records,  FBI  reports,  material  received  from  the  state  investigation,  and  other  \nconfidential  investigative  records;  court  transcripts;  investigative  transcripts;  prosecution  team  \nhandwritten  notes;  research  material;  and  draft  and  final  case  documents  such  as  the  NPA,  \nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.   \n \nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material \nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set \nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein \ncase  collected  by  Sloman;  Villafaña’s  Outlook  data;  Acosta’s  hard  drive;  and  the  permanently  \nretained official U.S. Attorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.   \n \n2. EOUSA Records \nEOUSA  provided  OPR  with  Outlook  data  from  all  five  subjects  and  six  additional  \nwitnesses.  This information, dating back to 2005, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and \nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained.  EOUSA provided OPR with over 850,000 \nOutlook records in total (not including email attachments or excluding duplicate records).  OPR \nidentified  key  time  periods  and  fully  reviewed  those  records.    OPR  applied  search  terms  to  the  \nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.   \n \nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records:  his inbox \ncontained no emails from May 26, 2007, through November 2, 2008.  This gap, however, was not \npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email.  OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.  During its \ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data \nwith  an  unrelated  employee  who  had  a  similar  name.    Once  the  data  was  properly  associated,  \nEOUSA  found  and  produced  11,248  Acosta  emails  from  April  3,  2008,  through  the  end  of  his  \ntenure at the USAO.  However, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the \nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2008 and 2009, Outlook data for all U.S. \n\n \n288 \n \nAttorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.  The USAO’s \ndata was migrated between March and June 2008.    \n   \nEOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any \nadditional  emails.    OPR  questioned  Acosta,  as  well  as  numerous  administrative  staff,  about  the  \nemail gap.  Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knowledge of the problem, or that they or, \nto their knowledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails.  In addition, at \nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Attorney’s \nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S. \nAttorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office.  OPR found no evidence \nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of \nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the \nresult of a technological error.   \n \nAlthough  a  gap  in  Acosta’s  email  inbox  from  May  26,  2007,  through  April  2,  2008,  \nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this \ntime  due  to  the  extensive  case  files  kept  by  the  USAO;  the  availability  of  Acosta’s  sent  email,  \nwhich  did  not  contain  a  similar  gap;  and  the  availability  of  emails  of  other  USAO  subjects  and  \nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.   \n \n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records \nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the \nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein matter, to obtain relevant FBI documents.  \nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation \nconcerning its victim notification system.   \n \n4. Criminal Division Records \nThe Office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with \nOutlook  data  for  the  four  individuals  from  that  Office  who  examined  issues  connected  to  the  \nUSAO’s  Epstein  investigation.    The  data  included  the  individuals’  inbox,  outbox,  sent,  deleted,  \nand saved emails, and calendar entries.   \n \nCEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who \nworked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation.  The data included \nthe individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails.  CEOS also conducted a check of \nits shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.  \n \n5. Office of the Deputy Attorney General Records  \nOPR  obtained  Outlook  data  for  the  three  individuals  from  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  \nAttorney  who  examined  issues  connected  to  the  USAO’s  Epstein  investigation,  including  the  \nformer Deputy Attorney General.  The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, \nand saved emails, and calendar entries. \n \n\n \n289 \n \n6. U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records \nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records \nrelated  to  its  review  of  evidence  against  Epstein,  after  he  concluded  his  Florida  state  sentence,  \nwhen  the  Department  recused  the  USAO  in  August  2011  from  “all  matters,  to  include  the  \ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with \nminor females,” and assigned the matter to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office \nfor further consideration.  The records included a declination of the matter due to the NPA.  \n \n7. U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records \nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records \nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.   \n \n8. Public Records \nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records \nof  the  Palm  Beach  Police  Department,  the  State  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  15th  Judicial  Circuit,  \nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court \nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.    \n \nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims \n1. Subjects \nOPR requested that all five subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement \nin  the  federal  investigation  of  Epstein,  the  drafting  and  execution  of  the  NPA,  and  decisions  \nrelating to victim notification and consultation.  In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews \nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter.  Each subject was represented by counsel \nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.  The \nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.   \n    \n2. Witnesses \nOPR conducted more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their \nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel.  OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff \nand attorneys and current and former Department attorneys and senior managers, including former \nDeputy  Attorney  General  Mark  Filip  and  former  Assistant  Attorney  General  for  the  Criminal  \nDivision Alice Fisher.  OPR also interviewed former State Attorney Barry Krischer and former \nAssistant State Attorney Lanna Behlolovick.   \n \n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Attorneys  \nOPR contacted attorneys known to represent 26 victims among the 30 surviving individuals \nwho  were  identified  in  the  USAO’s  July  2008  listing  of  32  victims  the  USAO  was  prepared  to  \ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.  OPR contacted the attorneys to invite \n\n \n290 \n \nthe  victims  to  provide  OPR  with  information  regarding  their  contacts  with,  and  notification  \nreceived  from,  the  FBI  and  USAO,  during  the  period  before  the  NPA  was  signed  or  before  \nEpstein’s state plea hearing, about the status of the federal investigation, about Epstein’s state plea, \nor about the NPA.  OPR received information from or pertaining to 13 victims.   \n\n(;+,%,7\u0014\n6WDWH ,QGLFWPHQW\n\n[Page Intentionally Left Blank] \n\np \nINDICTMENT \ncy \n~ !~~ \n;---I'\"'.\") \n• A TRUE BILL 0/o-' Cff.5JtU:')~~ ~ \ny:+-, l.. • 2r,,=: r-\nlN THE NAME OF AND BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF FL~ig A ~ \nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL \nCIRCUIT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA \n\\7 C.:) \n. ·:, ~:\"2 -0 \n........... ::.!: \n: :::: . \n·-, \n·: ~.=jn N . _ . .J \n.-:-<~ .r-\nFor Palm Beach County, at the Spring Term thereof, in the year of our  Lord Two Tho~j(id and Six, to-wit: \nThe Grand Jurors of the State of Florida, inquiring in and for the body of said County of Palm Beach, upon their \noaths \ndo present that JEFFREY E.

In this case, the \nUnited  States  Attorney  will  furnish  Epstein  with  notice  specifying  the  conditions  of  the  \nAgreement which he has violated.   \nAfter timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no prosecution for \nthe  offenses  set  out  on  page  1  of  this  Agreement  will  be  instituted  in  this  District,  and  the  \ncharges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.   \nNeither this Agreement nor any other document filed with the United States Attorney as \npart  of  this  Agreement  will  be  used  against  Epstein,  except  for  impeachment  purposes,  in  \nconnection with any prosecution for the above-described offenses.   \nTerms of the Agreement: \n1.Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by\nthe  State  Attorney’s  Office  for  the  15th  Judicial  Circuit  in  and  for  Palm\nBeach   County   (hereinafter,   the   “State   Attorney’s   Office”)   charging\nviolations of the following Florida Statutes:\n(a)lewd  and  lascivious  battery  on  a  child,  in  violation  of  Fl.

The United States shall make\na motion with the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida  for  the  appointment  of  a  guardian  ad  litem  for  the  identified\nvictims  and  Epstein’s  counsel  may  contact  the  identified  victims  through\nthat counsel.\n6.Epstein  shall  enter  his  guilty  plea  and  be  sentenced  not  later  than\nSeptember 28, 2007, and shall begin service of his sentence not later than\nOctober 15, 2007.\nBy  signing  this  agreement,  Epstein  asserts  and  certifies  that  each  of  these  terms  is  \nmaterial  to  this  agreement  and  is  supported  by  independent  consideration  and  that  a  breach  of  \nany one of these conditions allows the United States  to  elect  to  terminate  the  agreement  and  to  \ninvestigate and prosecute Epstein for any and all federal offenses. \nBy  signing  this  agreement,  Epstein  asserts  and  certifies  that  he  is  aware  of  the  fact  that  \nthe  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  provides  that  in  all  criminal  \nprosecutions  the  accused  shall  enjoy  the  right  to  a  speedy  and  public  trial.    Epstein  further  is  \naware  that  Rule  48(b)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure  provides  that  the  Court  may  \ndismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting a charge to \nthe  Grand  Jury,  filing  an  information,  or  in  bringing  a  defendant  to  trial.    Epstein  hereby  \nrequests  that  the  United  States  Attorney  for  the  Southern  District  of  Florida  defer  such  \nprosecution.    Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to the \ndate of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed \nto be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such prosecution \non the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules \nof  Criminal  Procedure  and  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  to  a  \nspeedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute of limitations for a \nperiod of months equal to the period between the signing of this agreement and the breach of this \n\n3DJH4RI4 \nagreement.    Epstein  further  asserts  and  certifies  that  he  understands  that  the  Fifth  Amendment  \nand Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that all felonies must be charged \nin  an  indictment  presented  to  a  grand  jury.    Epstein  hereby  agrees  and  consents  that,  if  a  \nprosecution against him is instituted, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed by the \nUnited States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury. \nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and \nexplained   to   him.      Epstein   hereby   states   that   he   understands   the   conditions   of   this   \nnon-Prosecution Agreement and agrees to comply with them.   \nDated: ___________ ____________________________________ \nJeffrey Epstein \nDated: ___________ ____________________________________ \nRoy Black, Esq. \nCounsel to Jeffrey Epstein \nR.
