Believe me, your letter went a long way in ending this.

Roy Black called me and said: \"before you hang up — it's all \nover with Epstein ... I just need to update things.\" called Roy back who, over course wanted more time but \nwas told that there would be no extensions etc. Although I anticipate some last minute tinkering, since it is now Thursday, \nit is 50/50 whether they will make our Monday 5:00 pm deadline to plead, be sentenced and surrender.

We alerted \nthe AG's office that it was likely that they might try to contact them, and we advised them that they should not take their \ncalls. The AG was advised of the matter. What is the status for you folks? Thanks. \nEFTA00013829",
