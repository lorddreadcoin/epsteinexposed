The phone number below, 561-833-7517, \nis the main office number in West Palm Beach, and Miami's office number is 305-944-9101. (The switchboard operators at \neither number can verify my identity.) \nI  am trying to locate the financial and /or investment conference that two individuals attended in New Orleans between \napproximately 1998-2000 and what hotels your conference would have used during those time periods. I  believe your \nconference may be the one I  am looking for. \nI  am trying to determine if the following two individuals attended the New Orleans Investment Conference between 1998-\n2000; \n1. Jeffrey Epstein \n2. \nAny information or assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. \nThank you, \nSA J. \nFRI Miami Division \n505 Hagler Dr. Ste. 500 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \n(561) \n833.7517 \n(561) 650-6951 fax \nEFTA00019162",
