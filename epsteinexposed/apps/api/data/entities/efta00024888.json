    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nIc\nM=> \nTo: \nBOBBI C STERNHEIM \n< \nCc: Christian Everdell < \n>, \n\"Mark \nS. \nCohen\" \nSubject: Re: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 \nDate: Thu, 07 Jan 2021 17:05:33 +0000 \nGood afternoon Bobbi: \nWe have receive your concerns and will be looking in to these matters. \nAll concerns will be properly addressed as needed. \nBest, \n>>> \nBOBBI \nC STERNHEIM ‹> 1/6/2021 \n2:38 \nAM \n>>> \nCounsel for Ghislaine Maxwell learned that she has been issued a \ndisciplinary charge. Please provide a copy of the Incident Report. \nMembers of the same team who physically mistreated and threatened Ms. \nMaxwell on Sunday now claim that she is not tidy (See email below.) \nThe basis of the charge is unclear - because Ms. Maxwell has not \ndeviated from her routine of the past 7 months. But the fact that it \ncomes after Ms. Maxwell and counsel made complaints \nabout staff is concerning, disturbing, and questionable. \nThe policy of rotating in staff from other institutions has contributed \nto lack of consistency and clarity in the management of Ms. Maxwell. One \nteam tells her one thing which is then contradicted by another team. \nOne team tells her she can't keep books in her locker; another team \ntells her to put books in her locker. One team tells her to keep a set \nof clothes in her isolation cell; another team faults her for doing so. \nMs. Maxwell's request for guidance is met with a terse response: \"Read \nthe A&O handbook.\" \nMs. Maxwell cannot ask other inmates for help and is at the mercy of \nguards who appear to delight is their power over her. The present team \nwas particularly harsh during a previous rotation and seem to have \nincreased their contempt for Ms. Maxwell. \nMs. Maxwell- and counsel- are concerned for her safety while in the \ncustody of the present team. \nIn lieu of an opportunity for Ms. Maxwell to be moved to another unit, \nand the unlikelihood that she would be \ntransferred to the MCC as a result of Epstein's death while BOP was \n\"asleep\" on the watch, we are requesting that the present team be \nremoved from guarding Ms. Maxwell. \nIssues still remain concerning Ms. Maxwell's meals.She still is not \nreceiving items on the menu. \nYesterday, she received the same meal for lunch and dinner. Tuesday \nmorning she was given an inedible black and rotting banana. Over the \nweekend she was given bologna, despite being on a non-flesh diet. The \nguard informed her that the meat had not been refrigerated and \nrecommended that she not eat it. \nThe MDC's inability to provide proper nutrition is reoccurring and \nEFTA00024888\n\nproblematic. \nThe problems keep escalating, giving rise to the belief that Ms. \nMaxwell is being targeted and victimized. I urge you to address and \ncorrect these problems. The failure to do so will \nresult in a request for court intervention. \nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C.

In addition to written reports, the physical and \nverbal incidents should have been captured on the hand-held \n> camera, used constantly to surveil Ms. Maxwell. \n> This is not the first time Ms. Maxwell has been touched \ninappropriately by MDC staff, as MDC records should reflect. \n> Counsel for Ms. Maxwell make this report to put the MDC on notice: \n> Should Ms. Maxwell be further assaulted and threatened, we will file \nan official complaint with the Attorney General's Office and notify the \nCourt. This will further blemish the BOP's reputation, already tarnished \nby negligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The \nrestrictive conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention in the MDC correlate \ndirectly to the Epstein debacle in the MCC, making unprovoked rough \ntreatment of Ms. Maxwell baffling. \n> Be further advised, should Ms. Maxwell face any retaliation as a \nresult of this email, this too will be promptly reported. \nEFTA00024889\n\n> BOBBI C.
