Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York New York 10007 \nNovember 24, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nCohen & \nGresser LLP \nNew York, NY 10022 \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Mor an and Foreman, P.C. \nDenver, CO \n80203 \nBobbi Stemheim, Esq. \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C. Sternheim \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(AJN) \nDear \nCounsel: \nToday the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and \nGiglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced \ncase. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. \nThe Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the \nGovernment does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. \nThese materials do not contain a  comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the \nGovernment does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials \ncontain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing \nthese materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it \nhas any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. \nMoreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the \nenclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine \nthat it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. \nEFTA00031113\n\nPage 2 \nPlease note that this letter, the enclosed index, and the enclosed materials are governed \nby the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the materials are designated \nas \"confidential\" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as \"confidential,\" \nbecause it includes information regarding records designated as \"confidential\" under the \nProtective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of \nmaterials marked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid potential confusion with marking,; \nreserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of \nthis production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced \ntoday are marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER \nPARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs \nof the Protective Order that govern today's production. \nVery truly \nyours, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nby:  s/\nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nEFTA00031114",
