I made some edits directly in the index (saved on the shared and \nattached here). Some notes below on exhibits and the index. As noted in my prior email, is going to update the \nindex tomorrow morning to indicate which exhibits we intend to offer under seal. She may also have some other \ncomments/edits on exhibits and/or the index in the morning. As always, call or email with any questions. Thank you!! \n10Series \n•  I didn't update the spreadsheet, but I noticed a few things. \no  When I look in the folder, as I see it now \n•  GX-10 -  MV2 \nEFTA00026696\n\n• GX-11 —  MV6 \n• GX-12 —  MV1 \n• GX-13 —  MV4 \no GX 10 isn't listed in the spreadsheet. \no Remove MV-5 entry for now from index; when we get the certificate we will update \n300 series \n• Remove GXs 316 and 331 and move up the last exhibits in the series to fill the gap \n• GX 313 —  photo of GM including nudity (just making sure you see for redacting). Please cut \"(nude)\" from the \ndescription in the index, please. Add the appropriate asterisk. \n400 series \n• Do the word documents in native form (417A through 422A) have the old metadata?. Just want to be sure of this \nand asking because I see that it might be different based on properties when I looked \n• There is no GX 419. Can you please fill the gap? Or shift things up?
