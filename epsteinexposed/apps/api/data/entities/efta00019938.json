In light of the recent filing and media reports, wanted me to clarify \nher compensation with you. Aside from her regular salary, she did receive payments from Epstein in 2004 (to cover \ngym membership and English classes), as well as a lump sum payment of cash during 2005 (less than $10k). Epstein \nalso paid for meals, salon appointments, clothing, etc. while she was working for him in 2005. You will not find any \nlump sum payments made once she terminated her employment. \nAs always, feel free to contact me at any time if we can be of further assistance.
