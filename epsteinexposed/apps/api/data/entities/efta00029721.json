He confirmed that can go to the roof for recreation. \nSHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said is usually sleeping, and once he \neventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when and Epstein were housed together, \nE  stein asked about rec. The officer told Epstein he would take him at 6:00 AM before his attorneys showed up. \nwas in the cell during this conversation, and the officer told me made a  comment like \"I can take you up \ntogether\" to both of them. \nThe Facilities Manager told me they talked to He had no complaints about his cell. He only complained that \nwater leaked in his cell when people \"took ion showers.\" Facilities ran the shower for awhile and didn't see the water \nleaking down to cell, but if I give the benefit of the doubt, he may be correct that the water makes \nits way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. \nEvening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave the three newspapers that arrived in the mail yesterday morning. \nI think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else. \nThanks! \nStaff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetropolitan Correctional Center \nEFTA00029721\n\n>>  >> \n8/20/2019 \n2:47 PM \n›» \nan \nBruce Barket just filed the attached letter on ECF.
