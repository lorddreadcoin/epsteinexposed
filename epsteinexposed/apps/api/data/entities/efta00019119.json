See United States v. Escalera, 957 F.3d 122, 131 n.11 \n(2d Cir. 2020) (citing United States v. Grande, 620 F.2d 1026,1036-37 (4th Cir. 1980) (\"We read this legislative \nhistory to articulate a congressional intention that one may be found to have violated § 1510 only upon \nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the person who was intimidated, threatened, or harmed \nwas about to communicate information to another known by the accused to be a federal criminal \ninvestigator.\")). By contrast, as we have discussed, Section 1512(b)(3) has no such requirement. If you have a \ndifferent view of that issue or if there are any authorities you would like us to review, we'd be happy to look \nmore closely at the issue. \nPlease let us know if you have any questions, or if a call would be useful to discuss. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, September 3, 2020 12:46 PM \nTo: Samidh Guha Kathleen E.
