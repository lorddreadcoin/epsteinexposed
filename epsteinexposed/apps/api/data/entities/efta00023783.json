The confidential negotiation period shall last no more than two weeks, starting today, and ending at the end of the \nday on July 28, 2020 (the \"Negotiation Period\"); \n2. Both sides agree that the fact of the Negotiation Period, as well as any communications made during the \nNegotiation Period, shall be treated as confidential, and shall not be the subject of any public comments; \n3. If, as the result of negotiations conducted during the Negotiation Period, your client completes a voluntary \ninterview with U.S. authorities, either side may publicly confirm that your client met with United States law \nenforcement authorities and answered questions about matters under investigation. Neither party, or their \nrepresentatives, shall comment further on the circumstances or substance of the interview. \n4. Alternatively, if, at the end of the Negotiation Period, no agreement is reached, the parties will jointly inform the \nappropriate authorities in the UK and US that the parties are not able to reach agreement on a voluntary interview \nand accordingly a voluntary interview will not occur. \nWe believe these conditions directly address your stated concerns while allowing us to satisfy ourselves that all sides \nare endeavoring in good faith to either expeditiously reach agreement on a voluntary interview or reach agreement \nthat no such interview will occur. \nPlease inform us as soon as possible if you are amenable to this proposal. If so, we are prepared to schedule a call at \nyour earliest convenience to discuss arrangements for the interview. \nRegards, \nEFTA00023785\n\nFrom: Gary Bloxsome \nSent: Monde , Jul 13, 2020 11.49 \nTo: \n) \nCc: Daniel Cundy ; Jennifer Richardson ; \nSubject: Re: Sensitive correspondence \nDear \nGeoffrey Berman and Audrey Strauss have persistently commented about the prospects and purpose of \ninterviewing the Duke of York, prompting widespread media coverage.

However, your client has neither \noffered nor agreed to sit for a voluntary interview. That has left us no choice but to pursue a compelled interview. \nYou have asked about the confidentiality of any witness interview. We have previously told you, by email dated \nFebruary 4, 2020, and reiterate here, that it is our standard practice to refrain from publicly commenting on the \nsubstance of any witness interview, and we intend to abide by that practice in this case. It is also our standard \npractice to disclose information provided during a witness interview only in connection with an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation or proceeding, any related civil or forfeiture proceeding initiated by this Office, or as otherwise \nauthorized under U.S. law. We do not voluntarily share information with the press or civil litigants or members of \nthe public, and it is entirely unclear why you believe we might do so here. \nGive us a commitment that your client will sit for a voluntary interview with us, give us a date or dates that work for \nyou and your client, and we will be happy to schedule a call to discuss any additional arrangements or particular \nconcerns you may have. But until we have a commitment from your client to sit for a voluntary interview — and to \ndo so on a timeline that reflects the urgency of our ongoing investigation — we will continue to pursue a compelled \ninterview through all available legal channels. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Gary Bloxsome \nSent: Month Jul 06, 2020 09:15 \nTo: \n) <a> \nCc: Daniel Cundy ; Jennifer Richardson ; \nSubject: Re: Sensitive correspondence \nDear M, \nThank you for your email of 2 July 2020, sent late in the evening UK time. \nIt appears that there may be cultural differences between UK and US legal practice that are causing \nproblems in our communications. Normally in UK practice, any written communication is acknowledged \npromptly and any differences between the parties are identified in that correspondence. Following our \nemails of 3 and 8 June 2020, I  had expected the DOJ to at least acknowledge our email of 8 June 2020. I \ndid not expect to have to chase for an acknowledgment, let alone a response, on I  July 2020. \nI remain very keen to discuss a path for the Duke's voluntary cooperation, without necessity for compelled \nprocess under the MLAT. I  believe that through a cooperative agreement which could be reached, the Duke \nwould be able to provide answers to any relevant questions you may have. \nI am disappointed that your email response of 2 July 2020 seems to suggest that the DOJ has no interest in \ndiscussing the practical arrangements that obviously need to made to allow us to advise the Duke of York \nthat he should agree a process under which he provides witness evidence to you. For that discussion to \ntake place I would invite you to indicate what protections might be available to ensure that this process is \nfair and does not turn into a media circus. \nInsofar as you complain about our public statement on 8 June 2020, this solitary public comment was \nmade in response to what I believe have been highly unusual public statements and persistent and \ndeliberate leaks to the press by the DOJ, including the latest leak of the fact that there had been a mutual \nlegal assistance request. \nHowever, I acknowledge that both sides appear to have quite different views as to how we have reached \nthis position and who is in the right. May I  therefore suggest that we start afresh, and both make a good \nEFTA00023787\n\nfaith attempt to reach an agreement which will allow the Duke of York to provide the potential evidence \nyou seek. \nI do not believe that this agreement can be achieved by the DOJ unilaterally insisting that the Duke must \ncommit to a voluntary cooperation without any guarantee that he would have even the limited protection \nthat he would be given in the context of a request for mutual legal assistance. In the mutual legal assistance \nprocess in the UK, for example, he could only be required to answer questions and provide evidence that \nare demonstrably relevant to a US criminal trial. Whatever evidence he provides may only be used for the \nUS criminal proceedings and cannot be given to the press or deployed by civil claimants' lawyers. The \noverall confidentiality of the evidence taking process is supervised by a judge. \nIn those circumstances I do urge you to agree that we should at least attempt to iron out the cultural \ndifferences and practical issues between us by speaking on a call in the very near future. \nI look forward to hearing from you regarding a time you might be available to speak by telephone. \nKind regards \nGary \nGary Bloxsomell'artner \nCoronavirus — COVID-19 —A message to our clients and fellow professionals \nAll of the partners of the firm are still working and their contact details can be found on our website at \nwww.blackfords.com.

To the \ncontrary, in your email of June 8, you stated: \"we cannot commit to a particular form of cooperation until we are \nproperly informed and assured as to what protections, including as to confidentiality and use, are to pertain.\" We \nnote that notwithstanding your professed interest in confidentiality, that email was followed almost immediately by \na public release issued in your name that contained any number of false and misleading characterizations of your \ndealings with our Office and your client's purported interest in cooperation. \nIf and when you are prepared to arrange a date for your client to sit for an interview with our Office, we assume \nyou will let us know, and we will be happy to discuss the particulars of such an interview. Until such an interview \nis arranged, we will continue to report to the authorities in the UK, through the appropriate channels, that there has \nbeen no offer of a voluntary interview, nor any likelihood of one being scheduled, and that we will therefore have \nno alternative but to pursue a compelled interview via formal request. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Gary Bloxsome < \nSent: Wednesday, July 01, 2020 12:28 \nTo: \nCc: Daniel Cundy \nSubject: Sensitive correspondence \nDear\n›; Jennifer Richardson •=za> \nI  refer to our email dated 8th June 2020.
