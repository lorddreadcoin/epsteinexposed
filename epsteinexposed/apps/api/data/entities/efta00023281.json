Below is a screenshot of a page from the USMS investigation report from \n1/8/19 I mentioned on the phone. \nEFTA00023281\n\nIt appears the \nUSAO \nof the SDNY suspected that Mr. Epstein was not disclosing all his international travel. I \nwould like to ask about that. \n-What made the SDNY believe that Epstein may have been violating IML? \n-Were there prior reports that he may have violated IML? \n-Were there other investigations of Epstein's compliance with his obligations as a sex offender of concern to \nthe SDNY or DOJ over the years? \n-In my review of Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs obtained from the FAA, the two flights, one to Vienna, Austria \nand the second to Monaco, were not logged in FAA records. \n-Was there any indication that Epstein took steps to conceal certain flights from being tracked by U.S. \nauthorities? (the Vienna and Monaco flights were picked up from \"crowd-sourcing\"). \n-Does the SDNY believe Epstein had advanced knowledge he would be arrested? \n-Would the SDNY provide any reports detailing how the FBI and NYPD took him into custody...details about \nthe arrest itself?
