I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney in the United States Attorney's \nOffice for the Southern District of New York (\"USAO-SDNY\"). I have served in this capacity \nsince June 2020. Prior to my current role, I served as Deputy Chief and then Chief of the Public \nCorruption Unit in the USAO-SDNY from July 2017 and as an Assistant United States Attorney \nfrom January 2011. I supervised the Noel prosecution directly in my prior role as Chief of the \nPublic Corruption Unit, and I play a supervisory role over both the Noel and Tartaglione \nprosecutions in my current role as Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney. \n2. I am familiar with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New \nYork Times Company (the \"FOIA Requests\") that are the subject of this case, which seek \nrecords related to the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center \n(\"MCC\"). I am also familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons (\"BOP\") has withheld pursuant to exemptions 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F) of FOIA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5)-(7). In addition, I am familiar with the proceedings in United States of \n1 \nEFTA00015438\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 2 of 13 \nAmerica v. Noel, 19-CR-830 (Al), and United States of America v. Tartaglione, 16-CR-832 \n(KMK). True and correct copies of the Indictment filed in Noel on November 19, 2019 (the \n\"Noel Indictment\"), and the Superseding Indictment filed in Tartaglione on April 16, 2019 (the \n\"Tartaglione Indictment\"), are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively. The statements \ncontained in this declaration are based on my personal knowledge, documents maintained in the \nfiles of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution \nteams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and conclusions made in accordance therewith. \n3. I submit this declaration in support of BOP's motion for summary judgment in \nthis case. \nThe Prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein \n4. On July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with one count of conspiracy to \ncommit sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and \nthereafter incarcerated at the MCC until his death. \n5. On July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") at \nthe MCC due to, among other things, a risk of suicidality and safety concerns relating to housing \nhim with the MCC's general population. On July 18, 2019, a bond hearing as to Epstein was \nheld before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, after which the Court granted the government's \nmotion for remand and denied Epstein's motion for pretrial release. See Noel Indictment 1  10. \n6. On July 23, 2019, MCC officers responded to an emergency call and found \nEpstein on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. See Noel Indictment \n1  11. Michael Thomas, a correctional officer at the MCC and one of the defendants in the Noel \ncase, was one of the MCC officials who responded to this incident. See id. Epstein was \nsubsequently transferred out of the SHU, placed on suicide watch for 24 hours, and then \n2 \nEFTA00015439\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 13 \ntransferred to psychological observation, a different status in a different location within MCC's \nhospital ward, until July 30, 2019. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to the SHU. \nSee /dill 11-13. \n7. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found in his cell, not responsive and with a \nnoose around his neck. See id.1 26. He was transferred to a local hospital where he was \ndeclared dead shortly thereafter. See id. 1  27. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the \nCity of New York conducted an autopsy and determined that Epstein had committed suicide by \nhanging himself. See id. \n8. On August 29, 2019, following a public hearing on August 27, 2019, Judge \nBerman entered an order of nolle prosequi against Epstein. See Nolle Prosequi, Dkt. No. 52, \nUnited States v. Epstein, No. 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.). \nThe Prosecution of Tova Noel and Michael Thomas \n9. As alleged in the Noel Indictment, Thomas and Tova Noel were correctional \nofficers on duty at the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, the night of Epstein's death. See Noel \nIndictment 11 3-4. On that night, Noel and Thomas repeatedly failed to perform mandated \ncounts of prisoners under their watch, including Epstein. To conceal this failure, they repeatedly \nsigned false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates, when, in \ntruth, they had not conducted such counts. See id. 11 15-24. On November 19, 2019, Noel and \nThomas were charged in the Noel Indictment with one count of conspiring to defraud the United \nStates and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States \nCode, Section 371; and five counts as to Noel and three counts as to Thomas of making or using \na false writing or document, in violation of Tide 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and \n(2). Noel Indictment ¶9[ 28-40. The Noel case is pending before the Honorable Analisa Torres. \nTrial has been scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021. \n3 \nEFTA00015440\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 4 of 13 \nThe Prosecution and Incarceration of Nicholas Tartaglione \n10. In a superseding indictment filed on April 16, 2019, Nicholas Tartaglione was \ncharged with one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of Title 21, United \nStates Code, Section 846; four counts of intentional killing in furtherance of a drug trafficking \ncrime, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 848(e)(1)(A) and Title 18, United \nStates Code, Section 2; three counts of murder through the use of a firearm in furtherance of a \ndrug trafficking crime, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 924(j) and 2; one \ncount of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, in violation of Title 18, United State Code, Section \n1201; four counts of kidnapping resulting in death, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, \nSections 1201(a)(1) and 2; and four counts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit a \ncrime of violence in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1952 and 2. These \ncharges arise from the April 2016 murders of Martin Luna, Miguel Luna, Urbano Santiago, and \nHector Gutierrez. On April 19, 2019, USAO-SDNY filed a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death \nPenalty against Tartaglione. The Tartaglione case is pending before the Honorable Kenneth M. \nKarns. No trial date has been set. \nII. Tartaglione has been detained since he was arrested on December 19, 2016. For \ncertain periods of his detention, including in July 2019, Tartaglione was housed at the MCC. In \nearly July 2019, Tartaglione was transferred to the MCC's SHU. For a time, including on July \n23, 2019, Tartaglione was housed in the same SHU cell as Jeffrey Epstein. \nRecords Withheld from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on \nAccount of Likely Interference with Noel \n12. 5 U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) (\"Exemption 7(A)\") exempts from disclosure \"records \nor information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production \n4 \nEFTA00015441\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 5 of 13 \nof such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere \nwith enforcement proceedings ....\" \n13. I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of \nthe records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A), \nincluding those reflected on the index prepared by BOP and attached to the declaration of Kara \nChristenson (the \"BOP index\"). All of these records fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A). \n14. Public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably \nbe expected to interfere with the pending prosecutions of Noel and Thomas. These records \ninclude information about which numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, include \ndetails that are not publicly known or known to other witnesses, and include information and \ndocuments authored by potential trial witnesses. These records also include potential trial \nexhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not seen, and premature disclosure of \nthose materials could influence witness testimony at trial, or enable witnesses to change or shape \ntheir testimony. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein \ncould reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow \nwitnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. \n15. Further, premature public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption \n7(A) could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to \nseat a fair and impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of the records \nwithheld under Exemption 7(A) will be entered into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other \nrecords that may not be trial exhibits bear on the contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature \ndisclosure of these records, or the information contained therein, could influence potential jurors' \nunderstanding of the evidence at trial and the case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the \nrecords could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which \n5 \nEFTA00015442\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 6 of 13 \nwould also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. \nIn addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are \nexpected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents authored by potential trial \nwitnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence \npotential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. \n16. The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media \ncoverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of \nEpstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the \nrecords are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who \nhave been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. \nNon-Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on \nAccount of Likely Interference with Noel \n17. The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of responsive \nnon-email records withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). \n18. First, the government anticipates that MCC staffing records, including overtime \nlogs and daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 22, July 23 August 9, and 10, 2019 and \nsome of the dates in between, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. In \naddition, the government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. \nReleasing these materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' \npotential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, \nor influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. \n19. Second, the government anticipates that reports and memoranda prepared by \nBOP, such as the reports, memoranda, photographs, and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 \napparent suicide attempt; reports, memoranda, and letters concerning Epstein's August 10, 2019 \n6 \nEFTA00015443\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 13 \nsuicide and surrounding events; documents in BOP's possession from the New York City Office \nof Chief Medical Examiner; and reports and letters concerning MCC's and BOP's response to \nEpstein's death, may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, or were prepared by \nwitnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be \nexpected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their \ntestimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness \ntestimony or evidence. Alternatively, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or \nAugust 10, 2019 suicide and surrounding events is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial \npublication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants \nin the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which \nwould impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. \n20. Third, the government anticipates that certain medical and psychological records \nof Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were \nprepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these records could \ninfluence the testimony of potential witnesses, including by potentially causing them to alter or \nconfirm their testimony. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be \nexpected to prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which \nwould impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. \n21. Fourth, the government anticipates that documents related to counts of inmates, \nincluding logs, count slips, and rosters, and other entries in BOP logs for August 9 and 10 may \nbe trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will \ntestify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence \nwitnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to \nother evidence, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. \n7 \nEFTA00015444\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 13 \n22. Fifth, the government anticipates that an August 8, 2019, review of inmates in the \nSHU prepared by BOP may be a trial exhibit, the subject of witness testimony, and/or was \nprepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of this record could \nreasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow witnesses \nto alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. \nEmail Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on \nAccount of Likely Interference with Noel \n23. The considerations discussed above also apply to each of the categories of \nresponsive email documents withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). \n24. First, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, his \nincarceration prior to his suicide, and his mental health, including emails written by BOP's \nPsychology Services, discuss topics and information that the government anticipates may be the \nsubject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness \ntestimony, including by allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, \nor influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as \ndescribed above, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or is excluded from \nevidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for \nor against the defendants in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be \nshown during trial, which would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a \nfair and impartial jury. \n25. Second, emails relating to Epstein's death, investigations into Epstein's death, the \ncircumstances of his suicide, and the BOP's response to Epstein's death discuss topics and \ninformation that the government anticipates will be relevant to and/or the subject of witness \ntestimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness testimony, including by \n8 \nEFTA00015445\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 9 of 13 \nallowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential \njurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as described above, if \nevidence of Epstein's suicide is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these \nmaterials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action on \nthe basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which would impair the \ngovernment's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. \n26. Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how \ntheir release would interfere with the Noel prosecution would itself risk interfering with the Noel \nprosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions of the documents \nanticipated to be proffered as exhibits at trial, or that bear on other trial exhibits, would disclose \nelements of the Government's trial strategy in Noel, including its selection of trial exhibits and \nthe anticipated content of witness testimony. More detailed public descriptions could also \nprematurely disclose how the prosecution team expects the trial to proceed. \nRecords Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on \nAccount of Likely Interference With Tartaglione \n27. In the course of reviewing the responsive records that BOP has withheld pursuant \nto Exemption 7(A), prosecutors in the Criminal Division of the USAO-SDNY determined that \ncertain of the records refer to or discuss Tartaglione (the \"Tartaglione Records\"). Upon \ndetermining that some of the records withheld by BOP refer to or discuss Tartaglione, USAO-\nSDNY reviewed these records to determine whether their release would interfere with the \npending criminal action against Tartaglione. USAO-SDNY has concluded that release of certain \nof the withheld records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of \nTartaglione. This constitutes a basis to withhold these records under Exemption 7(A), \nindependent from the likely interference with the Noel prosecution discussed above. \n9 \nEFTA00015446\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 10 of 13 \n28. The Tartaglione Records fall within several categories of responsive documents \nwithheld by BOP and include reports and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide \nattempt; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email correspondence \nbetween Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; and medical and psychological \nrecords of Epstein prepared by BOP. The Tartaglione Records also include emails pertaining to \nEpstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, Epstein's mental and physical health, and \nEpstein's incarceration prior to his suicide. \n29. The Tartaglione Records fall within the scope of 7(A) because their disclosure \ncould reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of Tartaglione. The Tartaglione \nRecords contain, among other things, information about Tartaglione's incarceration, including \nthe period of time during which Tartaglione was Epstein's cellmate at the MCC, which includes \nthe date of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. The conditions of Tartaglione's \nconfinement at the MCC, as well as his interactions with Epstein in July 2019, have been put \ndirectly at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection with the potential \npenalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 2010, Dkt. No. 186, \nUnited States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (ICMK); Letter dated January 21, 2020, Dkt. No. \n193, United States v.  Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense counsel's position, \ninformation contained in the Tartaglione Records may be relevant evidence in any possible \npenalty phase of the case against Tartaglione, and as a result, premature public disclosure of the \nTartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to influence witness testimony and/or \npotential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. \n30. Moreover, the nature of the charges against Epstein and the circumstances of his \napparent suicide attempt and death create a risk that premature public disclosure of the \nTartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the \n10 \nEFTA00015447\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 11 of 13 \ndefendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Tartaglione, particularly for purposes of a \npotential penalty-phase hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, by influencing potential juror \nperceptions of any interactions between Epstein and Tartaglione. \n31. The risks of interference with the Tartaglione proceedings are heightened by the \nmedia coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. As noted previously, many \npublicly-discussed theories of Epstein's death are unfounded. The public dissemination of these \ntheories increases the risk that premature release of the Tartaglione Records could influence \nwitness testimony or jurors' perceptions, if records are released in part or without full context. \n32. The Tartaglione Records include several categories of records withheld by BOP. \nSpecifically, the government anticipates that premature disclosure of the reports and evidence of \nEpstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt; an inmate investigative report prepared prior to \nEpstein's death; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email \ncorrespondence between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; the August 8, \n2019 review of inmates in the SHU at MCC; and the medical and psychological records of \nEpstein prepared by BOP, including documents pertaining to his mental health, could reasonably \nbe expected to adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' \nperceptions of Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to seat a fair and \nimpartial jury. In addition, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, \nEpstein's mental health, and Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide, including emails that \ninvolve members of the defense or prosecution teams in Tartaglione, discuss topics and \ninformation that could adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential \njuror's perceptions of Tartaglione. These records likewise could reasonably be expected to \nimpair the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. \nII \nEFTA00015448\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 12 of 13 \n33. Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how \ntheir release would affect the Tartaglione prosecution would itself risk interfering with the \nTartaglione prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions would \npotentially implicate and publicize associations, interactions, or perceptions of associations or \ninteractions between Tartaglione and Epstein, thereby risking influencing potential jurors in \nproceedings against Tartaglione, including for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3593. \nSegregability \n34. The records withheld in full under Exemption 7(A) are exempt from disclosure in \ntheir entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt \ninformation, such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably \nbe expected to interfere with the Noel and/or Tartaglione prosecutions for the reasons discussed \nabove. The media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the \nsegregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing \ninformation pertaining to Epstein (or Tartaglione and Epstein) without complete context can \nreasonably be expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about his \ndeath. This, in turn, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the district court's ability to \nseat a fair and impartial jury in proceedings against Noel, Thomas, and/or Tartaglione, including \nfor any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, for the reasons discussed above. \n12 \nEFTA00015449\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 13 of 13 \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.

On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL \nTHOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as \ncorrectional officers at \nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center \n(\"MCC\"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated \ncounts of prisoners \nunder their watch in  the \nMCC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\"). \nInstead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS \nsat at their desk, browsed \nthe Internet, and moved around the \ncommon area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their \nduties, NOEL and THOMAS \nrepeatedly signed false \ncertifications \nattesting to having conducted \nmultiple counts of inmates when, \nin \ntruth and in \nfact, they never conducted such counts. As a result \nof those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU \nwere being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as \na  result of  the defendants' conduct, no  correctional officer \nconducted any count or round of the \nSHU from approximately 10:30 \nEFTA00015452\n\nCagage2D19-698C3830A1E1 \nODmcaunmwnt2f2-Fil€dEklagIfl20'a@ageB \nb021 \np.m. \non \nAugust
