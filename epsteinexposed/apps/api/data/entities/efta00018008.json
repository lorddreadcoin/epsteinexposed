Count One \nrelates to multiple minor victims during the time period 1994 to 2004. \nCount Two of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring to engage in sex \ntrafficking of minors. Count Two relates to multiple minor victims during the time period 2001 \nto 2004. \nCount Three of the Indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of minors. \nCount Three relates to Minor Victim-4, during the time period 2001 to 2004. \n2 \nEFTA00018009\n\nBurden of Proof and Multiple Counts \nIn a moment, I will describe those three counts in more detail. Before I do, however, let \nme explain that the Government has the burden of proving the defendant's guilt on each count by \na preponderance of the evidence. That means that the Government must show that it is more \nlikely than not that the defendant is guilty of each count. \nYou must consider each count separately and return a separate verdict of guilty or not \nguilty for each. Whether you find the defendant guilty or not guilty as to one offense should not \naffect your verdict as to any other offense charged. \nYou have no doubt heard that a defendant's guilt in a criminal case must be proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. That is not the standard we are applying in today's exercise. As I \nsaid, the question for you today is whether it is more likely than not that the defendant is guilty \nof \neach count. \n3 \nEFTA00018010\n\nCount One: Conspiracy to Transport Minors \nAs I mentioned, Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiracy to \ntransport minors between 1994 and 2004. \nIn order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of conspiracy, the \nGovernment must establish each of the following elements: \nFirst, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count One, a \nconspiracy to transport a minor with intent that the minor engage in sexual activity for which a \nperson can be charged with a criminal offense. You should know that a conspiracy just means that \nthe defendant you are considering agreed with at least one other person to violate the law. \nSecond, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the \nconspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object \nand with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. The defendant's mere presence at the \nscene of the alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, \nmere knowledge or acquiescence, without participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In \nother words, knowledge without agreement and participation is not sufficient. On the other \nhand, it is not necessary for the Government to show that a defendant was fully informed as to all \nthe details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part, and it does not \nmatter whether the defendant's role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or \ndifferent in nature or in length of time from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was \nherself a participant. \nWith respect to Count One, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to \ntransport an individual with intent that the person engage in sexual activity for which a person can \nbe charged with a criminal offense, the Government must prove that the purpose of the conspiracy \nwas to transport an individual with intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a \n4 \nEFTA00018011\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, which contains three elements: \nFirst, that the defendant knowingly transported an individual in interstate or foreign \ncommerce. This means that the Government must prove that the defendant knew both that she \nwas causing the individual to be transported, and that the individual was being transported in \ninterstate commerce. The Government does not have to prove that the defendant personally \ntransported the individual across a state line or international border. It is sufficient to satisfy this \nelement that the defendant acted through an agent or was engaged in the making of the travel \narrangements, such as by purchasing tickets necessary for the individual to travel as planned. \nSecond, that the defendant transported the individual with the intent that the individual \nengage in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count \nOne alleges sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the criminal \nlaw of New York. Specifically, a person commits sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree \nwhen he or she subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent. Under New \nYork law, \"sexual contact\" means any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person \nfor the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party. Also under New York law, a person \nless than seventeen years old is incapable of consent. \nThird, the individual must be less than seventeen years old, and the defendant must know \nthat the individual is less than seventeen years \nold. \nIt is not a defense to the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree that the minor \nvoluntarily participated or consented. \n5 \nEFTA00018012\n\nCount Two: Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking \nCount Two charges the defendant with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking between 2001 \nand 2004. \nAs with Count One, in order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of \nconspiracy, the Government must establish the following elements: \nFirst, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count Two, a \nconspiracy to commit sex trafficking. \nSecond, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the \nconspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object \nand with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. \nWith respect to Count Two, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to \ncommit sex trafficking, the Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the \npurpose of the conspiracy was to commit sex trafficking, which contains four elements: \nFirst The defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or \nobtained a person. Those terms have their ordinary, everyday meanings. \nSecond: The defendant knew that the person was under the age of eighteen years. \nThird: The defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a commercial sex \nact. The term \"commercial sex act\" means \"any sex act, on account of which anything of value \nis given to or received by any person.\" The thing of value may be money or any other tangible \nor intangible thing of value that may be given to or received by any person, regardless of whether \nthe person who receives it is the person performing the commercial sex act. It is not required \nthat the person actually have performed a commercial sex act, and it is not a defense that the \nperson \nconsented. \nFourth: The defendant's acts were in or affecting interstate commerce. I instruct you \n6 \nEFTA00018013\n\nthat acts and transactions that cross state lines, or which affect the flow of money in the stream of \ncommerce to any degree, however minimal, are acts and transactions affecting interstate \ncommerce. For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that traveled in interstate \ncommerce. Proof of actual travel is not required. \n7 \nEFTA00018014\n\nCount Three: Sex Trafficking of Minor Victim-4 \nCount Three charges the defendant with the sex trafficking of Minor Victim-4 between \n2001 and 2004. I  have just reviewed the four elements of sex trafficking with you. In order to \nsatisfy its burden of proof with respect to Count Three, the Government must establish by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed those elements in the sex trafficking \nof Minor Victim-4. \nIn addition, you may find the defendant guilty of Count Three under a them of \nliability called \"aiding and abetting,\" which permits a defendant to be convicted of a specified \ncrime if the defendant, while not herself committing the crime, assisted another person or \npersons in committing the crime. To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that \nthe Government prove that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way \nwith the crime committed by the other person and willfully and knowingly sought by some act to \nhelp the crime succeed. \n8 \nEFTA00018015",
