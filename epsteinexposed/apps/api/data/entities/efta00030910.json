NATHAN, District Judge: \nOn November 25, 2020, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a letter request \nseeking an in camera conference for the presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and \na request to seal the November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for \nthe sealing request. On November 30, 2020, the defense counsel filed a second letter no longer \nfully pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and instead proposing \nredactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters. The Government has \nindicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80. \nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions, which \nare consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the three-part test \narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. \n2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are \n\"judicial documents;\" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the \nmaterials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at \n119-20. \"Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to `the danger of impairing law \nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and `the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.' Id. \nat 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"Anrodeo II\")). \nEFTA00030910\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 81 Filed 12/03/20 Page 2 of 2 \nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's letter \nmotions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial \nprocess,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the first element of the \nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo 1\"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And \nwhile the Court assumes that the common law presumption of access attaches, in balancing \ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments \nthe Defendant has put forth—including, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals \nreferenced in the letters-favor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby \nORDERED to docket the redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. \nFor the reasons outlined in the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, \nthe Court DENIES the Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the \nprivacy interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit \nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored redactions. \nThe parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a briefing \nschedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: December 3, 2020 \nNew York, New York ALISON J.
