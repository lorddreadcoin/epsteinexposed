Nothing would have \nprevented a process server from tying up to the dock \nand asking for him, Epstein said. \nBrunel and MC2 sued Epstein in January 2015 in \nMiami, claiming the notoriety and bad publicity \nstemming from sexual assault and prostitution \ncharges against Epstein cost the agency business. \nBrunel has been linked to Epstein and has \nbeen \naccused by at least one victim of supplying Epstein \nwith underage girls. \nEpstein pled guilty in 2007 to felony charges \ninvolving solicitation of prostitution and procurement \nof minors for prostitution. He served 13 months in \nprison and is a registered sex offender. \nBrunel tried to serve Epstein at his residential address \nin New York, but Epstein successfully moved to \nquash service, according to the opinion. Brunel then \ntried the Virgin Islands business address, which \nthe \ntrial court deemed acceptable in September 2018. \nBut the Third District said that in order for substitute \nservice to be acceptable under Florida law, it must be \nmade on an individual doing business as a sole \nproprietorship. The Virgin Islands business is not a \nsole proprietorship owned by Epstein, according to \nthe appeals court. \nIn February, a Florida federal judge ruled that \nprosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney and current \nLabor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the \nCrime Victims' Rights Act when they signed a \nnonprosecution agreement with Epstein without \nnotifying his victims. \nThe Miami Herald, in an investigative report \npublished late last year, printed emails showing that \nEFTA00010250\n\nthe alleged victims were deliberately excluded from \nthe deal cut between Acosta, who was then the U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of Florida, and \nEpstein's defense team. \nEpstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens \n— claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, \nFlorida, mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have \nnot had the opportunity to testify in court in any \nproceeding thus far, according to the Herald report. \nAn attorney for Brunel declined to comment \nWednesday. Attorneys for Epstein did not \nimmediately respond to a request for comment. \nJudges Kevin Emas, Edwin A. Scales RI and Norma \nS. Lindsey sat for the Third District. \nEpstein is represented by Scott J. Link and Kara \nBerard Rockenbach of Link & Rockenbach PA. \nBrunel and MC2 are represented by \nJoe Titone. \nThe case is Epstein v. Brunel et al., case number \n3D18-1997, in the Third District Court of Appeal of \nFlorida. \nEFTA00010251",
