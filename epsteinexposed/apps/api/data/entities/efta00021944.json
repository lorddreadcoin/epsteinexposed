United States, 519 U.S. 172, \n178 \n(1997) 2, \n3 \nUnited \nStates v. Salim, \n189 F. Supp. 2d 93, 98 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002) \n3 \nRules \nFed. R. Evid. 401  1, 2 \nFed. R. Evid. 403 1, 3 \nFed. R. Evid. 404 1 \nii \nEFTA00021946\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to \nintroduce at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others, \nhowever, such as the ones described below, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no \nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell objects to the \nfollowing exhibits pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 403 and 404(b): \nI. The Exhibits \nGovernment Exhibit 251 and 288 are framed photograph \nThe photographs have no nexus to Ms. Maxwell \nThe photographs have no probative value to any allegation in this \ncase and appear to be offered to demonstrate some character flaw in Mr. Epstein and, by \nassociation, Ms. Maxwell. \nGovernment Exhibit 294 is a box containing an item described as \"Twin Torpedos.\" This \nbox was apparently seized during the execution of a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm \nBeach, Florida, on October 20, 2005. These items are inadmissible for the reasons discussed in \nMs. Maxwell's Motion to Exclude Items Purportedly Seized During Search of 358 El Brillo Way \non October 20, 2005. In addition to problems related to the evidentiary foundation of these items, \nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in \n2005, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here. No witness will identify these items as having \nbeen in Ms. Maxwell's possession or used in connection with any crime alleged in the \nindictment. \n1 \nEFTA00021947\n\nGovernment Exhibit 313 purports to be a photograph of Ms. Maxwell, purportedly seized \nfrom a DVD disk in a binder found on a shelf in Jeffrey Epstein's house when it was searched in \n2012. There is no nexus between any allegation in this case and the photograph. \nGovernment Exhibit 606 is a document titled \"Household Manual\" which was apparently \nprinted from an unidentified computer or other electronic storage device. There is no evidentiary \nfoundation for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, \"2/14/2005,\" \nsuggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create \nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did. \nII. The Items are Not Relevant \nRule 401 defines relevant evidence as that which \"has any tendency to make a fact more \nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,\" so long as \"the fact is of consequence in \ndetermining the action.\" Fed. R. Evid. 401; see also Old Chief v.  United States, 519 U.S. 172, \n178 \n(1997). \nThere is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any \nof the above listed items. \nRegardless, the photographs are not probative of any material fact in this case. \nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the \"Twin Torpedos\" in 2005 is not probative of anything. \nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2019 prove no material fact in this \ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed below. \nFinally, the unauthenticated 2005 \"Household Manual\" is outside the time frame alleged \nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment. \nIII. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial \n\"The term `unfair prejudice,' as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some \nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different \n2 \nEFTA00021948\n\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.\" Old Chief v. United States, at 180. Federal Rule of \nEvidence 403 provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value \nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, ... or by considerations of ... \nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 403 \ndefine \"undue prejudice\" as an \"undue tendency to suggest decision on an \nimproper basis, \ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\" See United States v. Salim, 189 F. Supp. \n2d 93, 98 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002). \nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice \nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues. Introduction of Exhibits 251 and 288 will likely \nnecessitate Defense production of evidence surrounding the photographs including testimony \nfrom \nThere is no Government witness who claims that they ever saw or used the \"Twin \nTorpedos\" allegedly seized in 2005. To the extent the Government claims the items are relevant \nto establish that Epstein used sex toys, any probative value of this \"fact\" is outweighed by \nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell. \nThe 2019 photograph of Ms. Maxwell have no role in any allegation here. To the extent \nthat the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms. \nMaxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony. \nThe Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors \nmay find offensive. Given the lack of foundation related to the anonymous, unsigned and \nunauthenticated document any marginal relevance is outweighed by issues of confusion, \nspeculation and prejudice. \n3 \nEFTA00021949\n\nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court enter an order prohibiting the \nintroduction of these proffered exhibits. \nDated: October 18, 2021 \nRespectfully submitted, \ns/ \nJeffrey S.
