Timely access to \ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA \ndisdosures with \nchildren, youth, \nand adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon's literature review framework. 33 \nstudies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and \nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to \npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis. five themes emerged: (I) Disclosure is an \niterative, interactive process rather than a  discrete event best done within a  relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure \nmodels reflect a  social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for \nunderstanding the complex interplay of individual, \nfamilial, \ncontextual, \nand cultural factors involved in CA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there \nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have \nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture a  cohesive picture of dis. \ndosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental. contextual, and cultural factors. \nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future \nresearch. \nKeywords \nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts \nIntroduction \nTimely access to supportive and therapeutic resources for child \nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health \nand mental health well-being of children, youth, and adults. \nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit \nCSA disclosures have the potential to facilitate earlier disclo-\nsures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and \npotentially prevent further sexual victimization. Increased \nknowledge on both the factors and the processes involved in \nCSA disclosures is timely when research continues to show \nhigh rates of delayed disclosures (Collin-VEzina, Sablonni, \nPalmer, & Milne, 2015; Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, & Romito, \n2004; Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman, \nJones, & Gordon, 2003; Hershkowitz, Lanes, & Lamb; \n2007; \nJonzon & Lindblad, 2004; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., \n2000). \nIncidence studies in the United States and Canada report \ndecreasing CSA rates (Fallon et al., 2015; Finkelhor, Shattuck, \nTurner, & Hamby, 2014; Trocme et al., 2005, 2008), while at \nthe same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of \n18-20% for females and of 8-10% for males (Pereda, Guilera, \nFours, & Gomez-Benito, 2009). The highest rates found for \ngirls is in Australia (21.5%) and for boys in Africa (19.3%), \nwith the lowest rates for both girls (11.3%) and boys (4.1%) \nreported in Asia (Stoltenborgh, van Uzendoorn, Euser, & \nBakermans-Kranenburg, 20 I 1). These findings point to the \nincongruence between the low number of official reports of \nI Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work. University of Toronto. Toronto. \nOntario.

For example, a  meta-analysis conducted by Stolten-\nborgh, van LIzendoom, Euser, and Bakermans-Kranenburg \n(2011) combining estimations of CSA in 217 studies published \nbetween 1980 and 2008 revealed rates of CSA to be more than \n30 times greater in studies relying on self-reports (127 in 1,000) \nthan in official report inquiries, such as those based on data \nfrom child protection services and the police (4 in 1,000) (Ju-\nlian, Cotter, & Perreault, 2014; Statistics Canada 2013). In \nother words, while 1  out of 8 people retrospectively report \nhaving experienced CSA, official incidence estimates indicate \nonly 1  per 250 children. In a survey of Swiss child services, \nMaier, Mohler-Kuo, Landholt, Schnyder, and Jud (2013) fur-\nther found 2.68 cases per 1,000 of CSA disclosures, while in a \nrecent comprehensive review McElvaney (2015) details the \nhigh prevalence of delayed, partial, and nondisclosures in \nchildhood indicating a  persistent trend toward withholding \nCSA disclosure. \nIt  is our view that incidence statistics are likely an under-\nestimation of CSA disclosures, and this drives the rationale for \nthe current review. Given the persistence of delayed disclosures \nwith research showing a  large number of survivors only dis-\nclosing in adulthood (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Easton, 2013; \nHunter, 2011; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 2000), these \nissues should be a concern for practitioners, policy makers, and \nthe general public (McElvaney, 2015). The longer disclosures \nare delayed, the longer individuals potentially live with serious \nnegative effects and mental health problems such as depres-\nsion, anxiety, trauma disorders, and addictions, without receiv-\ning necessary treatment. This also increases the likelihood of \nmore victims falling prey to undetected offenders. Learning \nmore about CSA disclosure factors and processes to help \nadvance our knowledge base may help professionals to facil-\nitate earlier disclosures. \nPrevious literature reviews examining factors influencing \nCSA disclosure have served the field well but are no longer \ncurrent. Important contributions on CSA disclosures include \nPaine and Hansen's (2002) original review covering the liter-\nature largely from the premillennium era, followed by London, \nBruck, Ceci, and Shuman's (2005) subsequent review, which \nmay not have captured publications affected by \"lag to print\" \ndelays so common in peer-reviewed journals. These reviews \nare now dated and therefore do not take into account the \nplethora of research that has been accumulated over the past \n15 years. Other recent reviews exist but with distinct contribu-\ntions on the dialogical relational processes of disclosure (Reit-\nsema & Grietens, 2015), CSA disclosures in adulthood (Tener \n& Murphy, 2015), and delayed disclosures in childhood (McEl-\nvaney, 20I5). This literature review differs by focusing on CSA \ndisclosures in children, youth, and adults from childhood and \ninto adulthood—over the life course. \nMethod \nKiteley and Stogdon's (2014) systematic review framework \nwas utilized to establish what has been investigated in CSA \ndisclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nlight the most convincing findings that should be considered for \nfuture research, practice, and program planning. This review \ncentered on the question: What is the state of CSA disclosure \nresearch and what can be learned to apply to future research \nand practice? By way of clarification, the term systematic \nrefers to a methodologically sound strategy for searching liter-\nature on studies for knowledge construction, in this case the \nCSA disclosure literature, rather than intervention studies. The \nyears spanned for searching the literature were 2000-2016, \nbuilding on previous reviews without a great deal of overlap. \nRetrieval of relevant research was done by searching interna-\ntional electronic databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Edu-\ncational Resources Information Center, Canadian Research \nIndex, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Pub-\nlished International Literature on Traumatic Stress, Sociologi-\ncal Abstracts, Social Service Abstracts, and Applied Social \nScience Index and Abstracts. This review searched peer-\nreviewed studies. A search of the gray literature (unpublished \nliterature such as internal agency documents, government \nreports, etc.) was beyond the scope of this review because \nunpublished studies are not subjected to a peer-review process. \nKeyword search terms used were child sexual abuse, childhood \nsexual abuse, disclosure, and telling. \nA search of the 9 databases produced 322 peer-reviewed \narticles. Selected search terms yielded 200 English publica-\ntions, I  French study, and 1  Portuguese review. The search was \nfurther refined by excluding studies focusing on forensic inves-\ntigations, as these studies constitute a specialized legal focus on \ninterview approaches and techniques. As well, papers that \nfocused exclusively on rates and responses to CSA disclosure \nwere excluded, as these are substantial areas unto themselves, \nexceeding the aims of the review question. Review articles \nwere also excluded. Once the exclusion criteria were applied, \nthe search results yielded 33 articles. These studies were sub-\njected to a thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke \n(2006). This entailed (I) multiple readings by the three authors; \n(2) identifying patterns across studies by coding and charting \nspecific features; (3) examining disclosure definitions used, \nsample characteristics, and measures utilized; and (4) major \nfindings were extrapolated. Reading of the articles was initially \nconducted by the authors to identify general trends in a  first \nlevel of analyses and then subsequently to identify themes \nthrough a deeper second-level analyses. A table of studies was \ngenerated and was continuously revised as the selection of \nstudies was refined (see Table 1). \nKey Findings \nFirst-level analysis of the studies identified key study charac-\nteristics. Trends emerged around definitions of CSA disclosure, \nstudy designs, and sampling issues. First, in regard to defini-\ntions, the term \"telling\" is most frequently used in place of the \nterm disclosure. In the absence of standardized questionnaires \nor disclosure instruments, telling emerges as a  practical term \nmore readily understood by study participants.

\"How and when do \npeople decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences \nwith adults?\" (Hunter, 2011, p. 161); \"Some men take many \nyears to tell someone that they were sexually abused. Please \ndescribe why it  may be difficult for men to tell about/discuss \nthe sexual abuse\" (Easton, Saltzman, & Willis, 2014, p. 462). \n\"Participants were asked a series of open-ended questions to \nelicit a  narrative regarding their experiences of telling...\" \n(McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2012, p. 1160). \"Who was the \nfirst person you told?\" (Schaeffer, Leventhal, & Anes, 2011, p. \n346). \nThere was sound consistency between studies, defining dis-\nclosure in multifaceted ways with uniform use of categories of \nprompted, purposeful, withheld, accidental, direct, and indi-\nrect. However, defining the period of time that would delineate \na disclosure as delayed varied widely across studies, wherein \nsome studies viewed I  week or I  month as a delayed disclosure \n(i.e., Hershkowitz et al., 2007; Kogan, 2004; Schembucher, \nMaier, Moher-Kuo, Schnyder, & Lamdolt, 2012). Other studies \nsimply reported average years of delay sometimes as long as \nfrom 20 to 46 years (Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 2004; \nSmith et al., 2000). \nSecond, the number of qualitative studies has increased sig-\nnificantly over the last 15 years. This rise is in response to a \nprevious dearth of qualitative studies. Based on Jones's (2000) \nobservation that disclosure factors and outcomes had been well \ndocumented through quantitative methods; in a  widely read \neditorial, he recommended \"Qualitative studies which are able \nto track the individual experiences of children and their percep-\ntion of the influences upon them which led to their disclosure of \ninformation are needed to complement .. . \"  (p. 270). \nThird, although a few studies strived to obtain representative \nsamples in quantitative investigations (Hershkowitz, Horowitz, \n& Lamb, 2005; Kogan, 2004; Smith et al., 2000), sampling was \nfor the most part convenience based, relying on voluntary par-\nticipation in surveys and consent-based participation in file \nreviews (Collings, Griffiths, & Kumalo, 2005; Priebe & Sve-\ndin, 2008; Schembucher et al., 2012; Ungar, Barter, McConnell, \nTutty, & Fairholm, 2009a). Therefore, generalizability of find-\nings is understandably limited. The qualitative studies used \npurposive sampling as is deemed appropriate for transferability \nof findings to similar populations. Some of those samples con-\ntained unique characteristics, since they were sought through \ncounseling centers or sexual advocacy groups. These would be \nconsidered clinical samples producing results based on disclo-\nsures that may have been delayed or problematic. This might \npresumably produce data skewed toward bathers and bring \nfonvard less information on disclosure facilitators. \nThrough an in-depth, second-level analysis, this review \nidentified five distinct themes and subthemes beyond the gen-\neral trends as noted earlier. \nTheme 1: Disclosure is viewed as an ongoing process as \nopposed to a  discrete event—iterative and interactive in \nnature. A subtheme was identified regarding disclosure as \nbeing facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is \nbeing more clearly delineated. \nTheme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a \nsocial—ecological, person-in-environment perspective to \nunderstand the complex interplay of individual, familial, \ncontextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure. \nSubthemes include new categories of disclosure and a grow-\ning focus on previously missing cultural and contextual \nfactors. \nTheme 3: Age and gender are strong predictors for delaying \ndisclosure or withholding disclosure with trends showing \nfewer disclosures by younger children and boys. One sub-\ntheme emerged that intrafamilial abuse/family-like relation-\nship of perpetrator has a  bearing on disclosure delays or \nwithholding. \nTheme 4: There is a lack of a cohesive life-course perspec-\ntive. One subtheme includes the lack of data within the 18-\nto 24-year-old emerging adult population. \nTheme 5: Significantly more information is available on \nbarriers than on facilitators of CSA disclosure. Subthemes \nof shame, self-blame, and fear are uniformly identified as \ndisclosure deterrents. \nDisclosure as an ongoing process: Iterative and interactive in nature. \nDisclosure is now generally accepted as a complex and lifelong \nprocess, with current trends showing that CSA disclosures are \ntoo often delayed until adulthood (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; \nEaston, 2013; Hunter, 2011). Knowledge building about CSA \ndisclosure has moved in the direction of understanding this as \nan iterative and interactive process rather than a discrete, one-\ntime event. Since the new millennium, disclosure is being \nviewed as a dynamic, rather than static, process and described \n\"not as a single event but rather a carefully measured process\" \n(Alaggia, 2005, p. 455). The catalyst for this view originates \nfrom Summit (I 983) who initially conceptualized CSA disclo-\nsures as process based, although this notion was not fully \nexplored until several years later. Examinations of Summit's \n(1983) groundbreaking proposition of the CSA accommodation \n(CSAA) model produced varying results as to whether his five \nstages of secrecy, helplessness, entrapment and accommoda-\ntion, delayed, conflicted, and unconvincing disclosures, and \nretraction or recantation, hold validity (for a review, see Lon-\ndon, Bruck, Ceci, & Shuman, 2005). However, the idea of \ndisclosure as a process has been carried over into contemporary \nthinking. \nRecently, McElvaney, Greene, and Hogan (2012) detailed a \nprocess model of disclosure wherein they describe an interac-\ntion of internal factors with external motivators which they \nliken to a \"pressure cooker\" effect, preceded by a  period of \ncontainment of the secret. Moreover, this and other studies \nstrongly suggest disclosures are more likely to occur within a \ndialogical context—activated by discussions of abuse or pre-\nvention forums providing information about sexual abuse \n(Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Jensen, Gulbrandsen, Mossige, \nReichelt, & Tjersland, 2005; Ungar et al., 2009a). The term \nEFTA00024192\n\nMaggie et al. 277 \ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue. Key dialo-\ngical vehicles identified in these studies were providing sexual \nabuse information through prevention programs, being asked \nabout sexual abuse, and being prompted to tell (McElvaney \net al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009a). \nContemporary models of CSA disclosure reflect a  social cological \nperspective. Knowledge on CSA disclosure has been steadily \nadvancing toward a  holistic understanding of the complex \ninterplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural fac-\ntors (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Brazelton, 2015; Fontes \n& Plummer, 2010). Where at one time factors examined and \nidentified were predominantly of intrapersonal factors of child \nvictims, knowledge construction has shifted to fuller social—\necological, person-in-environment explanations (Alaggia, \n2010; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Easton et al., 2014; Hunter, \n2011; Ungar, Tutty, McConnell, Barter, & Fairholm, 2009b). \nSocial-ecological explanations open up more opportunities to \nintervene in facilitating earlier disclosures. Alaggia (2010) pro-\nposes an ecological mapping of what individual, interpersonal, \nenvironmental, and contextual influences impede or promote \nCSA disclosures based on analysis of in-depth interview data of \n40 adult survivors. Subsequently, based on a sample of 67 adult \nsurvivors, Collin-Vezina, Sablonni, Palmer, and Milne (2015) \nidentified three broad categories, closely aligned with an eco-\nlogical framework that impede CSA disclosure: (1) barriers \nfrom within, (2) barriers in relation to others, and (3) bathers \nin relation to the social world which can be aligned to intra-\npersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors. \nA summary of knowledge building using a social—ecologi-\ncal framework follows. Knowledge gained in the intrapersonal \ndomain includes expanded conceptualization of disclosure by \nbuilding on previous categories of accidental, purposeful, and \nprompted disclosure to also include behavioral and indirect \nattempts to tell, intentionally withheld disclosure, and triggered \nand recovered memories (Alaggia, 2004). Categories of indi-\nrect behavioral disclosure patterns have been further verified in \nfollow-up research by Hunter (2011), and through an extensive \nfile review that used Alaggia's (2004) disclosure framework to \nanalyze their data (Collings et al., 2005) for verification. \nInterpersonal factors have also emerged in regard to certain \nfamily characteristics as disclosure barriers. Families with \nrigidly fixed gender roles, patriarchal attitudes, power imbal-\nances, other forms of child abuse and domestic violence, chao-\ntic family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social \nisolation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia \nKirshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & \nPlummer, 2010). In addition, relationship with perpetrator is \na  factor whereby research indicates that disclosure is made \nmore difficult when the perpetrator is a family member or close \nto the family (Dumont, Messerschmitt, Vila, Bohu, & Rey-\nSalmon, 20 I 4;Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; \nHershkowitz et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Schanbucher \net al., 2012). This is especially a  barrier when the perpetrator \nlives with the victim (LeClerc & Wortley, 2015). \nIn terms of environmental factors, one study revealed that \nneighborhood/community conditions can hinder disclosure \nwhen there is lack of school involvement in providing a sup-\nportive environment, such as in following up on troubling stu-\ndent behavior (Alaggia, 2010). Additionally, a child victim's \nanticipation of a negative response to disclosure, especially that \nthey may not be believed by others outside their family such as \nneighbors or other community members, has shown to deter \ndisclosure (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015). \nCultural factors influencing CSA disclosure have been stud-\nied to a  much lesser degree. Despite this, a few important \nstudies examining critical sociocultural factors now exist for \nbetter understanding CSA disclosure within a cultural context \n(Brazelton, 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Among these \nimportant contributions, Brazelton's (2015) research has deli-\nneated CSA disclosure processes as \"shaped by relational, \nracial, socio-cultural, historical, and developmental factors\" \n(p. 182). In a  unique study using culturally focused research \nliterature as data triangulated with clinical case material, cul-\nturally based belief systems in many cultures have been found \nto foster family climates that can silence children from disclos-\ning abuse (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Taboos about sexuality, \npatriarchal attitudes, and devaluation of women are among \nsome of the cultural barriers that inhibit disclosure (Fontes & \nPlummer, 2010). \nClearly, disclosure conceptualizations are being integrated \ninto a social—ecological model of individual and developmental \nfactors, family dynamics, neighborhood, and community con-\ntext as well as cultural and societal attitudes toward better \nunderstanding disclosure barriers and facilitators (Alaggia, \n2010), although more data are needed on cultural and contex-\ntual factors. \nAge and gender as predictors of disclosure \nAge. Age is consistently found to be an influential factor in \nCSA disclosure, making the life stage of the victim/survivor a \ncritical consideration. Studies draw distinctions in age-groups \nfalling into either under or over 18 years of age. Eighteen years \nof age was the common age cutoff point that investigators chose \nin order to distinguish child/youth populations from adult sam-\nples. Sixteen of the studies drew on samples of children and \nyouth, while the other 15 studies sampled adults over the age \nof 18, and a further two studies used mixed age-groups (refer to \nTable I). Among the child and youth samples, the age ranges \nspanned from preschool to late adolescence (3-17 years of age), \nwith varying methodological approaches implemented across \nage cohorts. For younger cohorts, file reviews and secondary \ndata analyses of CSA reports were typically undertaken. Ado-\nlescents were most often given surveys. Sometimes children and \nyouth were interviewed as part of administering a survey or as a \nfollow-up (Crisma et al., 2004; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Ungar \net al., 200%). In the majority of child and adolescent samples, \nsexual abuse concerns were already flagged to investigative \nauthorities. However, the work of Ungar, Barter, McConnell, \nTutty, and Fairholm (2009a, 200%) is one exception, whereby \ntheir survey elicited new disclosures. \nEFTA00024193\n\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) \nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 40 and 50 \nyears. Interviews were the main data collection method with a \nfew exceptions using survey designs (i.e., Easton, 2013; Kogan, \n2004; Smith et al., 2000) and case file reviews (i.e., Collings \net al., 2005; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003). Results show a clear \ntrend toward increased likelihood of disclosure in older youth, \nand findings from adult samples showing a  preponderance of \ndisclosures in adulthood, with the large majority of participants \nof adults reporting never having had a sexual abuse complaint \nfiled with investigative authorities as a child or an adolescent \n(i.e., Hunter, 2011; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016; Sorsoli, \nKia-Keating, & Grossman, 2008; Ungar et al., 200%). \nWith children and youth under the ages of 18 distinct \npatterns emerged. First, accidental detection, rather than \npurposeful disclosure, is more likely to occur with younger \nchildren. For example, in one large-scale study of over \n1,737 file reviews, over half of the CSA-related cases were \nidentified through accidental and eyewitness detection (61%), \nwhile less than one third were purposeful disclosures initiated \nby the child victim (Collings et al., 2005). A second pattern \nwhich emerged is that rates of disclosure increase with age, \nespecially into adulthood, which is supported by persistent \nfindings of high rates of delayed disclosure reported later \nin the life course by adult survivors (Collings et al., 2005; \nCollin-Vezina et al., 2015 ; Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, \n2004; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015; Sorsoli et al., \n2008). While gender and relationship with the perpetrator are \nconsiderable factors in CSA disclosure, age is consistently a \nstronger predictor of disclosure (or nondisclosure) (Hershko-\nwitz et al., 2005; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015). Third, younger \nchildren who disclose are more likely to do so in an interview \nsituation or other environment that provides prompts or \nquestions about sexual abuse (Hershkowitz et al., 2005; \nMcElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., \n2011), but this trend can also be seen in older youth (Ungar \net al., 2009a, 2009b). \nGender. A number of studies have recently focused on CSA \ndisclosures with male victims, since males have been an under-\nstudied population (Alaggia, 2005; Easton, 2013; Easton et al., \n2014; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). Most investigations \nthat sampled both sexes show females outweighing male parti-\ncipants. Although women are at double the risk of being sub-\njected to CSA, the ratio of women to men in most disclosure \nstudies has not been representative. This finding may be indi-\ncative of male victims more likely delaying disclosing their \nCSA experiences, leaving male disclosure in child and youth \nsamples underrepresented (Hebert, Tourigny, Cyr, McDuff, & \nJoly, 2009; Ungar et al., 2009b). \nEaston, Saltzman, and Willis (2014) have been developing \ngender-specific modeling of disclosure examining male disclo-\nsures. Their proposed model groups male disclosures into barrier \ncategories as determined by individual factors, interpersonal \nissues, and factors that are sociopolitical in nature. These authors \nsuggest that predominant gender norms around masculinity rein-\nforce the tendency for male victims of CSA to blame themselves \nfor the abuse, resulting in no disclosure. Male participants in a \nsubsequent study also relayed that gender norms and stereotypes \ncontributed to them concealing the abuse because they were \nabused by a woman (Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). In the one \nstudy that compared male and female disclosures, investigator \nfound that men's fears of being viewed as homosexual; profound \nfeelings of stigmatization or isolation because of the belief that \nboys are rarely victimized; and fear of becoming an abuser acted \nas disclosure barriers. Whereas females felt more conflicted about \nwho was responsible for the abuse and more strongly anticipated \nbeing blamed and not believed (Alaggia, 2005). \nLack of a  life-course perspective. Given that the study of CSA \ndisclosure draws on age-groups ranging from samples of very \nyoung children to retrospective studies of adult survivors, with \nsignificant developmental considerations, this area of study \nlacks an intentional cohesive life-course perspective. Most data \nare derived from either cross-sectional or retrospective designs, \nwith few longitudinal studies. There are a series of sound, yet \ndisconnected, studies focusing on specific age-groups of chil-\ndren and adolescents, along with adult retrospective studies. \nThus, the available knowledge base does not allow for a cohe-\nsive picture of CSA disclosure processes and pathways over the \nlife course to emerge. \nThe life-course perspective has long been recommended as \na critical lens for the study of child abuse (Browning & Lau-\nmann, 1997; Williams, 2003). For example, a life-course per-\nspective has been utilized to understand the immediate- and \nlong-term effects of CSA on the developing child victim \n(Browning & Laumann, 1997). Further, a life-course perspec-\ntive is important in terms of examining age of onset of CSA to \nexplain the differential effects of sexual victimization and \ndevelopmental impacts in terms of understanding their ability \nto disclose—effects that need to be understood within a devel-\nopmental context, especially for designing appropriate inter-\nventions for disclosure at critical transitions from early \nchildhood through to adolescence and into adulthood. In addi-\ntion, important \"turning points\" in life may facilitate disclo-\nsures. For example, entry into adulthood given that delayed \ndisclosure occurs more often in adulthood. Alaggia (2004, \n2005) found that being in a committed relationship or the birth \nof children acted as facilitators for some survivors to disclose, \nespecially to their spouses. These significant life events, as \ncontributing to disclosures, bear further examination. \nSummary of barriers and facilitators. Research over the past 15 \nyears continues to uncover barriers to CSA disclosure at a \nhigher frequency than that of facilitators. As stated previously, \nthis might be the result of sampling methods whereby partici-\npants who volunteer for disclosure research may have had more \nnegative disclosure experiences, especially since many report \ndelays in disclosure. The following section outlines the major \ntrends in both barriers and facilitators (see Table 2). \nBarriers. Age and gender were found to contribute to barriers \nas covered in Theme 3. Disclosures generally increase with age \nEFTA00024194\n\nMaggie et al. 279 \nTable 2. Factors Influencing Child Sexual Abuse Disclosures. \nBarriers Facilitators \nAge: The younger the child victim, the less likely they will purposefully \ndisclose. \nGender: Males may be less likely to disclose in childhood/adolescence, \nfear of being seen as homosexual and as a victim, females experience \nmore self blame and anticipation of being blamed and/or not \nbelieved \nRelationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is a family member or in \na family like role. disclosure is less likely to happen \nInternal: Shame, self blame, and fear are psychological barriers. In \naddition, fear of negative consequences on the family and for self \nsafety inhibits disclosure \nFamily relations: families with a patriarchal structure, rigidly fixed \ngender roles, dysfunctional communication. other forms of abuse \n(i.e.. domestic violence), and isolation inhibit disclosure \nEnvironmental and cultural context Lack of discussion about sexuality; \npassive acceptance that unwanted sexual experiences are inevitable; \nnot wanting to bring shame to the family by admitting sexual abuse; \nlack of involvement from neighbors. school personnel; and stigma \nperpetuated by societal perceptions \nAge: Disclosures Increase with age. especially in adulthood. \nGender. Slight trend toward females who are older (adolescent) to \ndisclose before adulthood \nRelationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is not living with the \nvictim, disclosure rates increase \nDialogical context Opportunities to disclose through discussion. \ntherapeutic relationship, information sessions on sexuality, and \nsexual abuse prevention programs \nFamily relations: Supportive parent-child relationship. \nInvolvement of others: Eyewitnesses coming forward and reporting: \ndetection through community members, professionals \nEnvironmental and cultural context: Promotion of open discussion of \nsexuality; community member involvement \nas children gain more developmental capacity, understanding \nof sexual abuse as victimization, and increased independence. \nMales are somewhat less likely to disclose, but this is often in \ninteraction with other factors in the environment such as soci-\netal attitudes that promote hypermasculinity as desirable, atti-\ntudes that perpetuate negative views of boys and men who are \nvictims, and homophobic attitudes (Alaggia, 2010; Easton \net al., 2014; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). \nVictims of intrafamilial abuse when the offender is a parent, \ncaregiver, significant family member, or someone in a family-\nlike role are less likely to disclose immediately or at all in \nchildhood/adolescence because of obvious power differentials \nand dependency needs (Collings et al., 2005; Dumont et al., \n2014; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wort-\nley, 2015; Paine & Hansen, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2011). \nFurther, the perpetrator residing with their victim(s) \nincreases the likelihood of no disclosure (Leclerc & Wortley, \n2015). \nInternalized victim-blaming, mechanisms to protect oneself \n(such as minimizing the impact of the abuse), and developmen-\ntal immaturity at the onset of abuse constituted internal bar-\nriers. Further, shame, self-blame, and fear have been identified \nas significant factors deterring disclosure (Collin-Vezina et al., \n2015; Crisma et al., 2004; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; Hun-\nter, 2011; Kogan, 2004; McElvaney & Culhane, 2015; McEl-\nvaney et al., 2014). However, aspects of shame, self-blame and \nfear, and have not been fully explored in research. Since these \nare strong predictors of disclosure suppression, they bear fur-\nther examination in future research to understand more fully \nhow they operate in disclosure processes. \nIn terms of interpersonal and environmental factors, family \ndynamics can play a part in deterring disclosure. As previously \nmentioned, families characterized by rigidly defined gender \nroles, patriarchal attitudes that perpetuate power imbalances \nbetween men and women, parents and children, presence of \nother forms of child abuse and/or domestic violence, chaotic \nfamily structure, dysfunctional communication, and social iso-\nlation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia & Kir-\nshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & \nPlummer, 2010). In regard to broader environmental factors, \ndisclosure can be hindered when involved and supportive com-\nmunity members are not available, or not trained in sensitive \nresponses, or when child victims anticipate not being believed \nby neighbors and other people outside the family (Alaggia, \n2010; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015). Further, barriers in relation \nto the social world were identified as stigmatization, the neg-\native labeling of sexual abuse victims, and taboos surrounding \nsexuality and talking about sex as driven by cultural norms \n(Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). \nIdentification of cultural barriers is important recent contri-\nbution to understanding disclosure processes—and in particular \nto the obstacles. Findings related to cultural barriers included \nthemes of children's voices not being heard leading to silen-\ncing, the normalization of the sexualization and objectification \nof girls and women, and the perpetuation of hypermasculinity \nin men—all acting as barriers in terms of stigma to disclosure \n(Alaggia, 2005, 2010; Easton et al., 2014). Brazelton (2015) \nsimilarly found that lack of discussions about sex, young age at \nthe onset of sexual abuse, therefore not having the language to \nexpress what was happening to them, and preserving the family \ngood name by not talking about abuse in the family were also \nbarriers to disclosure. \nFinally, it may be the case that more barriers continue to be \nidentified over facilitators of CSA disclosure perhaps because \nof the methods employed in studies—particularly those draw-\ning on adult populations who delayed disclosure. These sam-\nples may not be representative of the overall population of CSA \nvictims, since they may have had more negative disclosure \nEFTA00024195\n\n280 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) \nexperiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers. \nOn the other hand, these findings may speak to the actual \nimbalance between facilitating factors and barriers for disclo-\nsure, the latter carrying more weight in the victims/survivors' \nexperiences, thus, explaining the high rates of disclosures \ndelayed until adulthood. \nFacilitators. Although fewer disclosure facilitators are identi-\nfied in this review, very important facilitators were nonetheless \nuncovered—ones that should be noted for professionals in this \nfield of practice. Internal factors that facilitate disclosures \ninclude symptoms that become unbearable, getting older with \nincreased developmental efficacy, and realizing that an offence \nwas committed (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Crisma et al., 2004; \nEaston, 2013; Hershkowitz et al. 2007; McElavaney, Greene, \n& Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 2011). Circumstantial facil-\nitators are those where the child discloses because there has \nbeen evidence provided, eye-witnessing has occurred, and a \nreport has been made. Environmental factors include settings \nthat provide opportunities such as counseling, interviews, \ninformation sessions and educational forumsAvorIcshops, and \nprevention programs for children and youth to disclose. \nTo elaborate, dialogical contexts about CSA for children \nand youth can provide opportunities for discussion that may \nfacilitate disclosures (Jensen et al., 2005). The research shows \ncreating open dialogue in relationship contexts, to offset the \npower and influence of the perpetrator, can facilitate earlier \ndisclosure. Among disclosure facilitators is being asked about \nabuse and given the opportunity to \"tell\" (McElavaney et al., \n2014); workshops on abuse and sexual abuse, in particular, can \nfacilitate disclosures (Ungar et al., 2009b); and using culturally \nsensitive probes and questions (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In \nGagnier and Collin-Vezina's (2016) study, positive disclosure \nexperiences were described by participants as those where they \nfelt that they had been listened to, were safe, were believed, and \nwere not judged by the person they disclosed to. Further, family \nmembers and friends (peers) of the child victim can act as key \nsupports to creating an open relational context and fostering \npositive responses (Jensen et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; \nSchonbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 20096). In particular, as \nchildren grow older, they are more likely to disclose to a peer, \nas shown in a number of studies, and this is an important reality \nfor counselors and educators to be aware of (Dumont et al., \n2014; Kogan, 2004; Sclainbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., \n2009b). \nDiscussion \nThrough examination of 33 studies published since the year \n2000, this review identified five distinct themes regarding CSA \ndisclosure: (1) Disclosure is best viewed as an iterative, \ninteractive process rather than a  discrete event done within \na  relational context; (2) contemporary models reflect a \nsocial—ecological, person-in-environment framework for \nunderstanding the complex interplay of individual, familial, \ncontextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; \n(3) age and gender are significant disclosure factors; (4) there \nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclo-\nsure continue to outweigh facilitators. Based on these themes, a \nnumber of conclusions are drawn from this review. First, dis-\nclosure as a  process is emphasized throughout contemporary \nresearch. Advances have been made in understanding these \ncomplex processes. However, the disclosure process over \ntime—for example, how the first detection of CSA or attempts \nto disclose in childhood impact later disclosures—are not well \nunderstood. This is the result of the absence of a cohesive life-\ncourse perspective in investigations, although age consistently \nsurfaces as significantly influencing CSA disclosure. Using a \nlife-course perspective through the use of longitudinal studies \nis recommended. \nThe use of varied methodological designs, depending on the \ndevelopmental stage of the victims/survivors, influences the \ndata generated and subsequent findings. For example, most \nstudies on children and youth are based on file reviews of cases \nthat have been brought to the attention of authorities, or sur-\nveys, with only a  few studies using interviewing of younger \nchildren. Therefore, there is less information available on pro-\ncess issues with children and youth. In contrast, research on \nadult populations largely favors the use of qualitative interview \nmethods for retrospective inquiry producing important process \nfindings. In addition, investigations have not yet captured the \ndisclosure experiences of adults in the \"emerging adult\" stage \ngiven that adult studies have failed to recognized that the age \nrange of 18-24, which is now considered a  developmental \nphase defined by neurobiological developmental uniqueness. \nAs well, late adulthood has not been given attention as shown \nby the absence of participants representing this age-group in \ncurrent research (70+). With a swelling geriatric population in \nNorth America, issues of historic CSA can be expected to \nsurface and, with that, new disclosures. This trend is also antici-\npated due to attitudinal shifts that have presumably occurred \nover the last two generations about revealing such traumas and \nchanging views about discussing sexual victimization. \nInterview guides used in a number of studies intentionally \nprobed for facilitators, producing notable findings. For exam-\nple, one such finding focuses on the importance of creating a \ncontextually supportive environment to promote disclosure \nacross the life course. These include developing therapeutic \nrelational contexts for disclosure by providing information \nabout sexuality, sexual abuse, prevention programming, and \nby asking directly. Disclosures to professionals are positive \noutcomes of how therapeutic contexts work; however, for for-\nensic purposes prompting such disclosures would be viewed as \nproblematic in legal settings, seriously compromising testimo-\nnies for trial proceedings. This is one example that speaks to the \nstructural barriers victims and survivors run up against time and \ntime again. Facilitators that show evidence to promote disclo-\nsure in one domain (therapeutic) are seen to work against CSA \nsurvivors in another domain—such as legal settings when per-\npetrators face prosecution. Defense attorneys will use this as \nevidence that the disclosure was prompted, and therefore the \ndisclosure is potentially seen as not credible. Broadcasting of \nEFTA00024196\n\nAlaggia et al. 281 \nthe frequency of acquitted cases or rulings in favor of the \nperpetrator through media outlets, often sensationalized, \nbecome a further compounding barrier. Given the review find-\nings, we conclude that barriers and facilitators to CSA disclo-\nsures are nuanced and clearly embedded within intrapersonal, \ninterpersonal, environmental, contextual, and cultural \ndomains—often interlocked in complex ways. \nLimitations \nAlthough comprehensive in nature with its life-course cover-\nage, this review may be limited by its qualitative, thematic \nfocus rather than providing an evaluative, quantitative account-\ning of CSA disclosures. However, because of the recent focus \non disclosure processes, the authors chose a suitably compati-\nble approach—qualitative in nature. As well, a  traditional \nchecklist approach in rating the studies was not employed for \ninterrater reliability, since two of the authors hold expertise in \nCSA disclosure research and are well versed with the literature. \nThis expertise, and through closely following a  systematic \nreview framework (Kiteley & Stogdon, 2014), assures that a \nthorough adjudication of the research literature was completed. \nImplications for Research and Practice \nThese review findings have implications that can be useful in \nguiding future research and practice: \n• Solid strides are being made in the use of a social—eco-\nlogical framework to underpin investigations in the CSA \ndisclosure investigations. Research efforts and practice \nconsiderations should continue in this vein. Investigat-\ning environmental factors and contextual and cultural \nforces is understudied, necessitating more research in \nthese areas to more fully fill out understanding of CSA \ndisclosure from a social—ecological perspective. \n• There is good evidence that CSA disclosures are more \nlikely to occur in a dialogical context—formal helping \nrelationships but as well as other relationships such as \npeers and trusted adults. Providing information and edu-\ncation on topics of sexuality in general, and sexual abuse \nspecifically, can help children and youth to disclose. \nRaising awareness and prevention programs can pro-\nmote disclosures of sexual violence committed against \nchildren and youth. \n• Goals of therapeutically supported disclosures (i.e., \nthrough therapy) may need to take precedence over for-\nensic approaches, if well-being of child victims and \nadult survivors is to be made paramount. Legal pro-\ncesses may act to facilitate disclosures but can also act \nas barriers because of the negative outcomes experi-\nenced in the court process. \n• \nPractitioners need to keep in mind that the legal system \nis lagging far behind in knowledge uptake of recent \nevidence on CSA disclosures so that victims and \nsurvivors continue to be systemically and structurally \ndisadvantaged in legal proceedings. \n• Health-care practitioners (i.e., child abuse pediatricians, \nfamily practice doctors, clinical nurse specialists, and \npublic health nurses) should be made aware of the evi-\ndence in the CSA disclosure literature to create environ-\nments for facilitating therapeutic disclosures. \n• Given that age is a stable predictor of disclosure of CSA, \nmore studies are needed that make use of a life-course \nperspective. More longitudinal studies are needed to \nbetter identify trends over different life stages. \n• The emerging young adult as a developmental age group \nneeds specific investigation. Neuroscience research has \nestablished that ages 18-24 is a distinct developmental \nphase. Late adulthood is another life stage that deserves \nto be researched. \n• Gender needs to be more fully investigated in relation to \nimpact on disclosure. Awareness that boys and girls \nhave unique challenges and barriers in disclosing CSA \nshould be paramount for practitioners. \n• Intervention planning should take note that disclosures \nincrease when perpetrators no longer reside with vic-\ntims, and this finding should be heeded by policy and \nlaw makers. \n• Shame, self-blame, and fear are intrapersonal factors \nthat persistently emerge as barriers to CSA disclosures \nand warrant more research to understand how to redress \nthese barriers for earlier disclosures. \nConclusion \nThere are still a  substantial number of children and youth \nwho are subjected to sexual abuse, despite preventative \nefforts. Just as concerning is the fact that many victims \ncontinue to suffer in silence as evidenced by the high num-\nbers of delayed disclosure. These hidden cases should not be \noverlooked, and these victims should not be forgotten. \nDespite significant progress in bringing the issue of CSA \nto the forefront, improving facilitation of disclosure and \nincreasing positive influences on disclosure processes are \nstill critical in order to protect current and future genera-\ntions of children and youth from the grave effects of sexual \nviolence. Further, the focus should not be simply on \nstrengthening and shoring up intrapersonal resources of vic-\ntims to disclose but rather to change environmental condi-\ntions to create a more supportive and safer context for CSA \nvictims and survivors to disclose. \nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests \nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with \nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this \narticle. \nFunding \nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research. author \nship, and/or publication of this article. \nEFTA00024197\n\n282 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) \nReferences \nAlaggia, R.

This paper reviews the research on disclosure patterns \nof childhood sexual abuse, specifically delays in disclosure, non-disclosure \n(as evident through adult retrospective studies) and partial disclosures, and \ndiscusses implications for practice. Literature searches of the online databases \nPSYCINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, in addition to manual searches \nof texts published since 2000, were conducted using the search terms 'child \nsexual abuse', 'sex abuse' and 'disclosure'. \nThe research to date on disclosure patterns is based on two sampling \nmethodologies —  studies of adults reporting retrospective experiences and \nstudies of children. The former group of studies has the benefit of drawing \non large-scale national probability samples which can be considered to be \nrepresentative of the general population. The latter group with some small \nexceptions (predominantly adolescent studies) uses samples of young people \nwho have disclosed sexual abuse but would not be considered as representative \nof all children who have been abused: \n'children who decide to tell someone about being sexually abused and whose \ncases therefore come to court are not representative of sexually abused children in general' \n(Olafson and Lederman, 2006, p. 29). \nPatterns of Disclosure: Delays and Non-disclosure \nThere is consensus in the research literature that most people who experience \nsexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when \ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common. Table 1 \nsummarises two large-scale studies to highlight the extent of delays in disclosure \nand the percentage of those who did not disclose to anyone prior to the study. \nKogan (2004) examined the timing of disclosure of unwanted sexual \nexperiences in childhood or adolescence in a sub-sample (n = 263 adolescent \nwomen, aged 12 to 17) of the National Survey of Adolescents (Kilpatrick and \nSaunders, 1995) in the USA —  a  nationally representative study. Kogan's \nresults can be summarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month) \n43 per cent, delayed disclosure (less than 1 year) 31 per cent and non-disclosure \n(disclosed only during the survey) 26 per cent. Smith and colleagues (2000) \nexamined a  sub-sample (n = 288) of the National Women's Study in the \nUSA (Resnick a al., 1993, cited in Smith et at, 2000) who had reported a \nchildhood rape prior to the age of 18. Smith el al.'s findings can be \nsummarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month) 27 per cent, \ndelayed disclosure (more than a year) 58 per cent and non-disclosure (survey \nonly) 28 per cent. Those who had never disclosed prior to the survey constitute \ncomparable proportions in these two studies while the rates for immediate \nTable I.

Their categories were slightly different from the previous \ntwo studies but in summary, immediate disclosers (within 1 month) constituted \n64 per cent of the sample while 29 per cent disclosed within six months. \nThis study is unusual insofar as the sample studied had reported their \nexperience of abuse to the authorities and a  prosecution was in progress. \nGoodman-Brown et at also pointed out that families who participated in this \nstudy were more likely to represent those children who experienced abuse by \nsomeone outside the family. Research has found that delays in disclosure are \nlonger for those abused within the family (Sjoberg and Lindblad, 2002; \nGoodman-Brown et at, 2003; Kogan, 2004; Hershkowitz a at, 2005). \nTherefore, children who disclose more promptly may be overrepresented in \nlegal samples. \nIn Sweden, Priebe and Svedin (2008) conducted a national survey of 4339 \nadolescents, of whom 1962 reported some form of sexual abuse (65% of girls \nand 23% of boys). Details of the time lapse in disclosing were not available \nfrom this study. However, of those who had disclosed and answered the \nquestions on disclosure (n = 1493), 59.5 per cent had told no-one of their \nexperiences prior to the survey. Of those who did disclose, 80.5 per cent \nmentioned a 'friend of my own age' as the only person who they had told. In \nthis study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities \nor police. A further Swedish study of 122 women who had experienced \nchildhood sexual abuse (Jonson and Lindblad, 2004) found that 32 per cent \ndisclosed during childhood (before the age of 18) while the majority told in \nadulthood (68%). The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 21 years \n(SD = 12.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person. \nIn Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3118, McGee et al., 2002) found that 47 per \ncent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault \nprior to age 17 had told no-one of this experience until the survey. McElvaney \n(2002) investigated delay in a legal sample of ten adults who had made formal \ncomplaints of childhood sexual abuse in Ireland and found delays ranging from \n20 years to 50 years. \nStudies of children in the context of forensic/investigative interviews \nwhere children are interviewed by professionals due to concerns that the \nchild has been sexually abused also point to high non-disclosure rates, \nparticularly striking in cases where there is corroborative evidence that \nabuse has occurred —  medical evidence (Lyon, 2007), or confessions from \nthe abuser or videotaped evidence/witness reports (Sjoberg and Lindblad, \n2002). Lyon (2007) reported his findings from a review of studies \npublished between 1965 and 1993 of children diagnosed with gonorrhoea \nwhere the average disclosure rate among 579 children was 43 per cent \n(n = 250). In a study where the evidence for the abuse was available on videotape, \nchildren have denied abuse when interviewed by the police (Sjoberg and \nLindblad, 2002). \nIn summary, significant numbers of children do not disclose experiences of \nsexual abuse until adulthood and adult survey results suggest that significant \nThe rates for \nimmediate disclosure \nare lower in the \nadolescent study than \nin the adult study' \n'Children who disclose \nmore promptly may \nbe \noverrepresented in \nlegal samples' \n`Delays ranging from \n20 years to 50 years' \nCopyright ID 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by \nearlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (1999) of five- to ten-year \nolds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in \nformal interviews) and Elliott and Briere (1994) of children aged eight to \n15 years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external \nevidence that led to more complete disclosures). \nMore recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and \nquestioning styles in the forensic interview and how this impacts on children's \ndisclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkowitz et at \n(2006) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse \nand those who did not (but about whom there was `substantial' reason to \nbelieve that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved \ndifferently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children \nwho presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave \nmore uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would \nappear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by \nincreasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children \nbeing less forthcoming. Lamb el al. (2002) have found that the use of a \nprotocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. 'tell \nme about that') as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no \nresponse) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children's \naccounts. \nAlthough few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of disclosure in \ninformal settings (when disclosure is made to a  friend or family member), \nsome qualitative studies have described this process. McElvaney (2008) quoted \none teenage girl who described hinting to her mother prior to disclosing the \nexperience: 'I didn't tell her what happened but I  was saying things that made \nher think it made her think that it happened but I  didn't tell her' (p. 127). A \nparent described how her teenage son told her over a period of days, keeping \nthe most difficult parts of the story until last: \n'Ile came out with like it came out over two or three days so you know.. _he'd say well \nI've something else to tell you... the bad stuff last... what hun him most and what he's \nsaying what hurt him most' (p. 92) \nAnd finally, one young person described how she told her social worker: \n'I couldn't tell her most things but I just gave things to her to read... I  told her at first I told \nher bits of it and em then just the others. I  finished writing and then I gave them to her... later \nI  told her that it was the father as well.' (p. 93) \nThis young person had been abused by both a father and son in a family with \nwhom she was staying. \nCopyright O 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Chid Abuse Rev. Vol. 24: 159 169 (2015) \n10.1002/ear \nEFTA00024203\n\nDisclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse 163 \nIn reviewing the literature on this subject, London and colleagues (2005) \nnoted, `when children do disclose, it often takes them a long time to do so' \n(p. 204). \nReasons for Patterns of Delay, Partial Disclosure and Non-disclosure \nThere are many influences on disclosure that have been identified in the \nresearch literature to help explain why it is that children delay disclosure, are \nreluctant to disclose, provide details of their experiences over time or do not \ndisclose at all. Age has been identified as a significant predictor of disclosure \nin that younger children are less likely to disclose than older children. Children \nwho are abused by a family member are less likely to disclose and more likely \nto delay disclosure than those abused by someone outside the family (Smith \na at, 2000; Goodman-Brown a at, 2003; Kogan, 2004). Children who do \ndisclose during forensic interviews compared to children who do not disclose \nin such contexts (yet concerns remain that they have been abused) are more \nlikely to have parents (particularly mothers) who are more supportive (Lawson \nand Chaffin, 1992). In Priebe and Svedin's (2008) study of young people, \nparental bonding (positive relationship with parent who was not overprotective) \nwas identified as the most significant predictor of disclosure for both boys and \ngirls. However, close relationships can also act as an inhibitor to disclosure. \nMcElvaney (2008) found that many young people in her study were reluctant \nto disclose due to concerns of upsetting their parents while others were concerned \nabout the consequences for others of their disclosure. One 13-year-old girl \ndescribed her concern that if she told, her uncle would go to jail and her small \ncousins would be left without a father: \n'I didn't want them to grow up with no Dad and just looking at ... their other little friends \nhaving their Dad holding their hand I  felt like I  was taking their Dad away from them' (p. 130) \nGender has been found to influence disclosure in that boys appear to be \nmore reluctant to disclose than girls (Goodman-Brown a at, 2003; \nHershkowitz a  at, 2005; Ungar a al., 2009a). Mental health difficulties on \nthe part of the child have also been found to be relevant, particularly when \nchildren experience dissociative symptoms or other post-traumatic stress \nsymptomatology (Priebe and Svedin, 2008). \nSome studies have found that the severity of abuse (e.g. penetrative abuse) \npredicts earlier disclosure while other studies have found no relationship \nbetween different types of abuse and disclosure timing. Similarly, the relationship \nbetween the duration of abuse — one-off incidents of abuse compared with abuse \nthat takes place over a significant period of time — and timely disclosure has been \ninvestigated with mixed findings. Fear of the consequences of disclosure has been \nidentified as a predictor of delayed disclosure and this in turn is associated with \nthe age of the child (Goodman-Brown a at, 2003). Older children are more \ncognitively competent in terms of being able to reflect on and anticipate possible \nreactions to their disclosure. This can act then as an inhibitor to disclosure, \nalthough as noted above, most studies have found that older children are more \nlikely to disclose than younger children. Fears of not being believed have been \ndescribed by young people as inhibiting their disclosure and these fears are often \n\"When children do \ndisclose, it often takes \nthem a long time to do \nso\" \n`Younger children are \nless likely to disclose \nthan older children' \n`Many young people \nin her study were \nreluctant to disclose \ndue to concerns of \nupsetting their \nparents' \n`Fear of the \nconsequences of \ndisclosure has been \nidentified as a \npredictor of \ndelayed \ndisclosure' \nCopyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hershkowitz a at (2007) interviewed children about their initial \ndisclosures prior to formal interview and 50 per cent of the sample (n = 30) \nreported feeling afraid or ashamed of their parents' reaction. The authors reported \nthat parents did show a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to \nthe disclosure. \nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct \nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose, \nsignificant proportions disclosed following prompts rather than it being \ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2004). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews \nwith children that focus on the disclosure process are important in \ninvestigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children. \nMcElvaney (2008) found that parents' questioning of children was prompted \nby their concern about the young person's emotional distress. On occasion, \nyoung people were communicating that something was not right in their world \nbut were not able to articulate this verbally. Signs of psychological distress \nwere, however, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress \nwere identified by McElvaney as a  factor that helped young people to tell. \nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse \nbecause they were not asked. McGee a al. (2002) followed up a sample of \ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their \nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many \nrespondents noted that it was because they had not been asked. Increasingly, \nresearch studies are finding that significant proportions of disclosure have \nbeen prompted by questions by caregivers, friends or others in the child's \neducational and social milieu that in themselves provide an opportunity for \nthe young person to tell (Jensen et at, 2005; Hershkowitz a at, 2007; \nMcElvaney et al., 2012). \nFinally, some children need time to tell. Mudaly and Goddard (2006) quote \na  13-year-old girl: `she (mother) helped by not making me, not rushing me \nto get it out, which, um, I  think it's a  really stupid idea to make kids get it \nout A.S.A.P.' (p. 91). \nImplications for Practice \nThe consensus in the research literature at the present time is that disclosure is \nmulti-determined, influenced by a complex range of factors that may influence \neach child in a different way. Large-scale national probability studies confirm \nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing \nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the \nwellbeing of children. Children's fears and anxieties in relation to telling need \nto be understood and contained by those in their environment so that early \ndisclosure can be encouraged and facilitated. \nThe implications of these findings can be considered in interrelated \ncontexts: the legal context where action can only be taken if the child is able \nto give a clear, credible account of his/her experiences; child protection and \ntherapeutic contexts where a comprehensive account is required to enable child \nprotection professionals to intervene and where the psychological sequelae can \nbe addressed to minimise the long-term impact of the experiences; and family \nand community contexts where early disclosure needs to be encouraged, and \nCopyright O 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Chid Abuse Rev. Vol. 24: 159 169 (2015) \nDOI: 10.1002/ear \nEFTA00024205\n\nDisclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse 165 \nother family issues addressed in the aftermath of disclosure and where peers \nplay an important role. \nStudies have confirmed the importance of professionals asking children and \nyoung people in a sensitive, open manner about possible experiences of abuse \nusing non-leading questioning styles to minimise inaccurate accounts or \ncontaminate children's narratives. It  is clearly important for professionals to \nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally \nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning \nthose children who are 'reluctant disclosers'. Similarly, professionals engaged \nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both \ninitial and further disclosures. \nContradiction in witness statements is a well-known feature of false statements \nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted \nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an \nearlier account. Listening to children's accounts of their experiences of disclosure \nhelps us understand why it is that disclosure can be delayed and that when they do \nfeel ready to tell this is not an 'all or nothing' decision. As one young person in \nStaller and Nelson-Gardell's (2005) study noted, 'it's never finished, never' p. \n1426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and \nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose. \nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an \nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in \ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it  is clear \nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education \nand increased awareness are needed on how to question children in an \nappropriate manner. McElvaney (2008) noted that questions did not need to \nbe about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young \nperson's psychological distress, asking after the young people's wellbeing. \nThis questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person \nto tell his/her secret (McElvaney et al., 2012). In Ungar el at's (2009a) study \nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a  range of disclosure \nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours, \nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from \npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service \nproviders), representing a  process that relied heavily on others to 'build the \nbridges between the youth and formal care providers' (p. 352). \nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures \nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In \naddition, the knowledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if \nonly a  percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with \nthis system. The disproportionately high 'immediate disclosure' rate found \nin Goodman-Brown a al.'s (2003) legal sample compared to Kogan's \n(2004) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed \ndisclosers in the legal system. Are children who delay in disclosing less likely \nto engage with the legal system? Are delays in disclosing contributing to \ndecisions not to prosecute child sexual abuse crimes? In Ireland, the 1990s \nsaw a significant increase in the numbers of complainants coming before the \ncourts reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse. Many of these cases \nwere referred to the higher courts for judicial review proceedings to establish \nwhether the cases could proceed without prejudicing the accused given the \n'Contradiction in \nwitness statements is \na well-known feature \nof false statements' \n'Education and \nincreased awareness \nare needed on how to \nquestion children in \nan appropriate \nmanner' \n'Are children who \ndelay in disclosing \nless likely to engage \nwith the legal system?' \nCopyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Child Abuse Rev. Vol. 24: 159 169 (2015) \nDOI: 10.1002/car \nEFTA00024206\n\n166 McElvaney \n'Concerns that \nengagement with the \nlegal system will lead \nto \nfurther \npsychological trauma \nneed to be considered' \n'Many young people \nwho delayed \ndisclosure to an adult \nhad told a  friend' \n'An adaptive strategy \non \nthe part of the \nyoung person to \ncontain the experience' \ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused's right \nto a speedy trial. Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these \nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable \nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see \nMcElvaney, 2002). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance \nthe knowledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved \nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for \nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more \nsympathetic to children's difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be \nthe case that the belief that 'if the child was really sexually abused, why would \nthey not tell?', as articulated by Summit (1983), still prevails. \nIn addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further \npsychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study \nconducted by Quas et al. (2005) indicated that the consequences of legal \ninvolvement change over the course of development and as a function of the \nchild's reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations \nbetween legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors \nsuggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some \nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at \nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative attitudes \nof others toward them. Quas and Goodman's (2011) recent review notes that \nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes. \nThus, as noted earlier, young people's fears of the consequences of disclosure \nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure \nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may \ngo some way to addressing children's fears. \nOne interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who \ndelayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2008) and Ungar \net al. (2009b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure \namong adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless \nof the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a  'critical period' for \ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those \nat risk of abuse) may be a  powerful prevention tool in encouraging early \ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shown \nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children \nand young people (Rispers et al., 1997; Zwi el al., 2007). It may be that the \nincreasing trend towards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational \nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness \ncampaigns when implemented as part of a  multi-dimensional strategy that \ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney, \n2010, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in \nthe prevention of child abuse. \nMcElvaney et al. (2012) describe the importance for young people of \ncontaining the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality following \ndisclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person \nto contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it. The conflict \nbetween wanting/needing to keep the secret and wanting/needing to tell is \nmediated by what they term the 'pressure cooker effect'. Young people in their \nstudy described influences from within and without that led to a build up of \npressure, ultimately leading to disclosure. They suggest that building up the \nCopyright (0 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Child Abuse Rev.

However, the lack of control that young \npeople experience following disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2009b; \nQuayle a  al., 2012). This highlights the need for dissemination of information \ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of \ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young \npeople and their families interface with the legal system. \nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in \nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying bathers to disclosure is \nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and \nprofessional interventions. The author is involved in a  large-scale review of \nchildren's files in an assessment service to ascertain those factors that helped \nchildren tell about their experiences of sexual abuse. A pilot study has \nsuggested that this is an appropriate methodology for gathering data on \nchildren's experiences of informal disclosure, acknowledging the limitations \nof such an approach. Ungar a  al. (2009a) describe the optimal conditions for \ndisclosure as follows: being directly asked about experiences of abuse; having \naccess to someone who will listen, believe and respond appropriately; having \nknowledge and language about what constitutes abuse and how to access help; \nhaving a sense of control over the process of disclosure both in terms of their \nanonymity (not being identified until they are ready for this) and confidentiality \n(the right to control who knows); and effective responses by adults both in \ninformal and formal contexts. \nUngar etal. (2009b) support recent developments in prevention programmes \nthat target supportive formal and informal caregivers in being better able to \ndetect the possibility of abuse and support disclosures rather than focusing \non empowering children themselves in making disclosures. Their findings in \nrelation to the importance of bridge building for young people to access formal \nsupports are supported by Jensen et at's (2005) emphasis on the dialogical \nnature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play \nin the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and \nasking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings a al., \n2005; Jensen et at, 2005; McElvaney et at, 2012).

The purpose of this study was to compare \nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers \n(i.e., more than I  week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure. \nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323 \nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (12 25 years). who were victimized by rape, but had no \nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse. \nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within I week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical \nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed \nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of \nage category 12 17 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, confidence intervals (CI) 1.13 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36, \nCI 1.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52 4.60) contributed significantly to the prediction \nof delayed disclosure. \nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to \ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services. \nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults: rape: sexual assault: disclosure; latency to disclosure; posurauniatic stress disorder \nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaett Ingolstadt.

There is \nevidence to suggest that victims believe that professionals \nwill not be helpful to them because their rape experience \ndoes not match stereotypical conceptions of rape, such \nas involving a  stranger, a  weapon, and severe injury \n(Patterson, Greeson, & Campbell, 2009; Resnick et al., \n2000). Accordingly, adolescents and young adults, who \nare more at risk to be victimized by rape than other age \n88flon \ngroups (De Haas, Van Berlo, Bakker, & Vanwesenbeeck, \n2012; Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006), may not receive targeted \nmental health care and may not report the crime to the \npolice (Ruch, Coyne, & Perrone, 2000). \nFor reasons of mental health and public safety, it is \nimportant to understand the potential factors that are \nrelated to disclosure. Timing of disclosure may be a crucial \nfactor, as early disclosers are more likely to utilize appro-\npriate medical care and report to the police than delayed \ndisclosers (Ahrens, Stansell, & Jennings, 2010; Ullman & \nFilipas, 2001). In contrast, adults who wait longer than \nmonth to disclose the rape are more likely to suffer \nfrom posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depres-\nsion compared to early disclosers (Ruggiero et al., 2004). \nEuropean Jamul or Psychotraumatciagy 2015.

E. Scant et al. \nIn addition, adolescents who disclose their rape experience \nat least I  month after the incident took place are found \nto be at higher risk for major depressive disorder and \ndelinquency (Broman-Fulks et al., 2007) compared to those \nwho disclosed within I month. \nVictim—assailant relationship is  crucial in disclosure \nlatency, with victims being at higher risk for delayed dis-\nclosure if there is a close relation with the assailant (Kogan, \n2004; Koss, 1988; Rickert, Wiemann, & Vaughan, 2005). \nIn contrast, delayed disclosure is less common in victims \nof a stereotypical rape, i.e., rape by a stranger including a \nweapon and injury (Smith et al., 2000). Victims of prior \nsexual trauma are more likely to postpone disclosure of a \nsubsequent assault than those without prior victimization \n(Smith et al., 2000; Ullman, 1996). This is in contrast with \nthe findings of Ahrens et al. (2010), who report no dif-\nference in rates of prior sexual trauma between early and \ndelayed disclosers. In addition, the victim's age appears \nto be an important variable in predicting disclosure. \nEvidence suggests that young children are at higher risk \nfor delayed disclosure than adolescents (Kogan, 2004; \nSchonbucher, Maier, Mohler-Kuo, Schnyder, & Landolt, \n2012). Thus, various rape and victim-related character-\nistics have been found to be associated with timing of \ndisclosure. \nThe majority of the aforementioned studies included \ncollege and adult female rape victims. It is important to \nexamine rape disclosure latency in an age and sex group \nthat is most at risk for rape victimization. There is  only \none prior quantitative study in adolescents (those aged \n12-17 years) that identified factors that might influence \ndisclosure latency (Kogan, 2004). He found that identity \nof the assailant, a familial relationship with the assailant, \nand a history of drug abuse in the household were related \nto the timing of disclosure. The results suggested that \na  familial relationship with the assailant will postpone \ndisclosure, whereas a history of drug abuse in the house-\nhold, albeit this seems counterintuitive, makes prompt \ndisclosure more likely. This study had some limitations, \nincluding the fact that the interviews were conducted by \ntelephone and that the description of the relationship with \nthe assailant was limited. Therefore, in the present study, \nwe investigated a sample of female adolescent and young \nadult victims of rape who were admitted to a specialized \nmental health centre for victims of sexual assault. The first \naim of this study was to compare demographics, post-rape \ncharacteristics, and psychological functioning between \nearly and delayed disclosers in this group. The second aim, \nbased on the exploratory findings of Kogan (2004), was to \ndetermine the predictors for delayed disclosure in adoles-\ncents and young adults, including age, prior trauma, and \nvictim—assailant relationship using logistic regression \nanalyses. Insight into the predictors for delayed disclosure \nfor adolescents and young adults may reveal not only \npotential causal mechanisms but also possible targets for \ninterventions that increase victims' opportunities to \nreceive timely post-rape services. \nMethods \nSubjects and data collection \nRape was defined as \"an event that occurred without the \nvictim's consent that involved the use or threat of force in \nvaginal, anal, or oral intercourse\" (Tjaden & Thoennes, \n2006). The definition includes both attempted and com-\npleted rape; the term \"completed\" referring to vaginal, \noral, anal, or multiple penetrations. Victims who disclosed \nwithin 1 week were defined as \"early disclosers,\" whereas \nthose who disclosed at least after 1 week were defined as \n\"delayed disclosers.\" This dichotomization of the variable \n\"disclosure latency\" was based on the study of Ahrens \net al. (2010) and the national standard criteria for admis-\nsion to a Rape Centre in the Netherlands, i.e., a maximum \nof 7 days post-rape. \nThe study was conducted in the Dutch National \nPsychotrauma Centre, which provides psychological ser-\nvices for rape victims aged 12-25 years and their parents. \nBetween May 2005 and December 2011, the centre re-\nceived 621 phone calls concerning alleged rape victims \nfrom police authorities, mental health services, and self-\nreferrals. In 178 cases, the phone call did not result in \nadmission at the centre because of age limitations, or \nmotivational reasons. In 108 cases, referrals were made to \nother institutions because the index trauma was chronic \nchildhood sexual abuse rather than rape in adolescence/ \nyoung adulthood. Of the 335 cases admitted to the centre, \n12 were not included in this study because of male gender, \nresulting in a  final sample of 323 females with the index \ntrauma being single rape. Referral sources for this final \nsample included the police (33.7%), mental health services \n(40.7%). and self-referrals, i.e., victims or parents (25.6%). \nProcedure \nDuring admission, all patients underwent a psychological \nassessment, consisting of 1) a  structured interview for \nobtaining demographic and post-rape characteristics and \n2) self-report questionnaires to obtain information about \nmental health functioning. Information from the inter-\nview was transcribed onto a form designed for this \npurpose. The following variables were obtained and \ndichotomized or categorized for the purpose of the study: \nDemographic and victim characteristics \nWe asked patients about their current age, educational \nlevel (lower, middle, or higher), and whether they were of \nDutch origin (i.e., in case of having parents born in the \nNetherlands). Those between 12 and 17 years of age were \ndefined as adolescents and those between 18 and 25 years \nof age as young adults. We also asked whether the patient \nwas living with their parent(s) (yes/no), and whether the \n2 \n*we number molter \nellnibn Disposal \nClaten: European Journal of Psychofnaumatdogy 2015. 6: 25883 htlp://thartorW10.3407Jept.v6.25BE3 \nEFTA00024212\n\nPrecictors of  delayed disclosure of  rape \nfamily structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological \nparents were living together (yes/no). Patients were then \nasked to confirm the presence of prior negative sexual \nexperiences (yes/no), and whether they had a current \nsexual relationship (yes/no). \nRape characteristics \nInformation about date and time of the rape was ob-\ntained to calculate the time since rape at admission. Next, \npatients were requested to describe the rape. Their re-\nsponse was categorized into use of penetration (yes/no), \ngroup rape (yes/no), use of physical violence (yes/no), and \nuse of threats verbally and/or with a  weapon (yes/no). \nAlso, information regarding the victim's relationship to \nthe assailant was obtained. The assailant was defined as \na  stranger when the victim had never been in contact \nwith the assailant before the rape. Responses were used \nto form a closeness category (yes in case of family, (boy) \nfriend, or mentor). Patients were also asked about the \n(estimated) age of the assailant (categorized into 12-17 \nyears or > 18 years), and whether the victim had used \nalcohol prior to the rape (yes/no). \nPost-rape characteristics \nPatients were asked when they first talked about the rape. \nThe response was used to calculate the disclosure time \nand the help-seeking time. At the end of the interview, \npatients were asked whether they had reported to the \npolice after the incident (yes/no), and whether they had \nreceived any medical care after the incident (yes/no). \nThe study was performed in accordance with the \nprecepts and regulations for research as stated in the \nDeclaration of Helsinki, and the Dutch Medical Research \ninvolving Humans Subjects Act concerning scientific \nresearch. According to the Ethical Medical Committee \nof the University Medical Centre Utrecht, this act was not \napplicable to the present study. Written informed consent \nwas obtained from both patients and parents. \nMeasures \nPosttraumatic stress \nThe Children's Responses to Trauma Inventory (CRTI; \nAlisic, Eland, & Kleber, 2006) was used for participants \naged 12-18 years. This is a  34-item questionnaire asses-\nsing severity of PTSD symptoms according to DSM-IV. \nPatients are asked to indicate to what extent a  reaction \nto a  traumatic event was present during the past week. \nScores range from I  to 5, with higher scores indicating \nmore symptomatology. The four subscales: Intrusion, \nAvoidance, Arousal, and Other Child-Specific Reactions \nconsist of 7, 11, 6, and 10 items, respectively. The reli-\nability of this instrument is good to excellent (Cronbach's \na 0.92 for total score, 0.79 for Intrusion, 0.77 for \nAvoidance, 0.71 for Arousal; Alisic & Kleber. 2010). \nFor the purpose of the study, only the total score was \nanalysed. \nDepression \nChildren Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992; \nTimbremont & Braet, 2002) was used for participants \naged 12-17 years of age. The CDI is a 27-item ques-\ntionnaire, assessing cognitive, affective, and behavioural \nsymptoms of depression. The Dutch CDI has a satisfac-\ntory internal consistency, with Cronbach's a ranging \nbetween 0.71 and 0.89 (Timbremont & Braet, 2002). \nBehavioural problems \nThe Youth Self-Report (YSR; Achenbach & Rescorla, \n2001) was used for participants aged 12—I8 years. This \nquestionnaire evaluates the teenager's perception of be-\nhavioural and emotional problems. YSR has shown to \nbe internally reliable (Cronbach's a's ranging from 0.71 \nto 0.95), and convergent and discriminant validity is \nreported to be satisfactory (Berube & Achenbach, 2006). \nThe YSR includes four broadband scales and nine \nnarrow-band scales to assess behaviour problems. For \nthe purpose of the study, only the total score on behaviour \nproblems was included in the analyses. \nGeneral psychopathology \nThe Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R; Arrindell & \nEttema, 1986) was used for participants aged 12-25 years. \nThis is a 90-item self-report inventory to assess psycho-\nsocial distress. Patients were instructed to indicate the \namount they were bothered by each of the distress \nsymptoms during the preceding week. Patients rated 90 \ndistress symptoms on a five-point Liken scale with \nbeing \"not at all\" and 5  being \"extremely.\" The state-\nments are assigned to eight dimensions, reflecting various \ntypes of psychopathology: anxiety, agoraphobia, depres-\nsion, somatization, insufficiency, sensitivity, hostility, and \ninsomnia. The Global Severity Index (GSI) can be used \nas a summary of the test and reflects the severity of all \nanswered statements as a global measure of distress. \nCronbach's a has been found to range from 0.73 to 0.97. \nFor the purpose of the study, only the GSI was analysed. \nData \nanalyses \nTo compare demographic and post-rape characteristics \nbetween the early and delayed disclosers, chi-square tests \nwere used. To compare multiple continuous psychological \nscores, MANCOVA was used with \"time since trauma\" as \na covariate to correct for the potential influence of time \nsince trauma. \nDelayed disclosure was used as a  dependent variable. \nThe strength of the univariate associations between each \npotential risk factor and delayed disclosure was estimated \nby calculating the odds ratio (OR) along with 95% \nconfidence intervals (95% CI). To determine the strongest \nrisk factors for delayed disclosure, each potential risk \nCitation: Eurccean Jame) of Psychoireumacology 2015. 8: 25883 ritip://cbc.dol.mgn0.3402teipt.v8.25883 3 \n(pope rwmber no. oor noon puma* \nEFTA00024213\n\nNa A.

Victims' age ranged from 12 to 25 \nyears, with a mean age of 16.7 years (SD =2.7) and a \nmedian age of 16.1 years. Victims' mean age at time of \nrape was 14.3 years (SD =2.7) and a median age of 13.9 \nyears. Penetration occurred in 79.6% of the cases. None \nof the victims reported prior chronic child sexual abuse. \nData about victim—assailant relationship are presented in \nTable 2. Victims first disclosed after a mean 20.8 weeks \n(SD =56.8, range 1-624 weeks), although 58.5% of the \ncases told within 1 week. First disclosure was to a friend \n(45.8%), parent(s) (17.1%), (ex) boy-friend (9.4%), family \nmember (6.8%), professional (5.8%), or other adult \n(15.2%). With regard to post-rape services, 53.8% of all \nvictims consulted a  doctor for medical care and 51.4% \nreported to the police. On average, victims were admitted \nto the centre 59.8 weeks post-rape (SD =93.7, range \n1-676).

No significant differ-\nences in demographic characteristics were found between \nearly and delayed disclosers, except that there were \nmore delayed disclosers in the age category 12-17 years \ncompared to the early disclosers group (x2  (1) =6.96; \np = 0.008). For rape characteristics, significant differences \nbetween groups were found for the use of penetration, \nwith more victims of penetration in the delayed disclosers \ngroup compared to the early disclosers group (x2 (I) = \n5.37; p =0.02). Also, the delayed disclosers group pre-\nsented more victims of verbal and/or weapon threats \nthan the early disclosers group (x2 (I)=5.35; p =0.02). \nFurthermore, among the delayed disclosers more victims \nidentified the assailant as a close person compared to the \nearly disclosers (x2  (I) =10.84; p =0.001). Alcohol was \nused more often in the early disclosers group compared \nto the delayed disclosers group (x2 (I) =20.24;p <0.001). \nWith respect to post-rape characteristics, a significantly \nsmaller proportion of the delayed disclosers (15.9%) \nutilized medical services following the rape compared \nto the early disclosers (30.3%; z2  (1)=5.32; p =0.02). \nSimilarly, a significantly smaller proportion of the delayed \ndisclosers (14.6%) compared to the early disclosers \n(34.3%) reported the rape to the police (x2 (I) =16.15; \np <0.001).

Mean and median \ntime to seek help were 37.7 and 12.0 weeks, respectively. \nMean time to seek help did not differ between groups \n(1(309)=2.54, p <0.48). Excluding outliers (M±3 SD, \nN = II) did not change the outcome of this analysis. Both \nearly and delayed disclosers scored in the highest level \nof psychological distress when compared to previously \nreported norm scores (CRTI, Alisic, Eland, Huijbregts, \n& Kleber, 2012; CDI, Timbremont et al., 2008; YSR, \nAchenbach & Rescorla, 2001; SCL-90, Arrindell & \nEttema, 1986), but the MANCOVA results showed that \nwhen comparing multiple continuous psychological \nscores, the overall psychological functioning (posttrau-\nmatic stress, depression, behavioural problems, and gen-\neral psychopathology) did not differ significantly between \nearly and delayed disclosers (F(6,I98) = 0.88, p =0.51). \nTable 3  shows the ORs with 95% Cls for the associa-\ntions between potential risk factors and delayed disclosure. \nDelayed disclosers, when compared to early disclosers, \nwere significantly more likely to be in the age category \nof 12-17 years (OR =2.10), to have experienced rape by \na  close person (OR = 2.35), to have been threatened \nverbally and/or with a weapon (OR =1.75), and to have \nexperienced penetration (OR = 1.99). Delayed disclosers \nwere also found less likely to have used alcohol prior to \nthe rape (OR = 0.22). None of the other factors were \nfound to be significant risk factors for delayed disclosure. \nPredicting delayed disclosure \nA stepwise forward LR analysis was conducted to predict \ndelayed disclosure, using \"age category,\" \"close assailant,\" \n\"use of threats,\" and \"penetration\" as predictors. Victims' \nalcohol use was not entered in the analysis because of \nmissing values for 33.4% of the cases. The use of threats \nwas not a significant predictor in the model. A test of the \nfull model against a constant-only model was statistically \nsignificant, indicating that the predictors (i.e., age cate-\ngory 12-17 years, close assailant, penetration) reliably \ndistinguished between early and delayed disclosers (22\n(3) = 23.09, p <0.000). There were no significant interac-\ntions between the predictors. Nagelkerke's R2  of 10.5% \nsuggests only a modest association between the predic-\ntors and delayed disclosure, although the model did show \nan adequate fit to the data (Hosmer-Lemeshow x 2  (4) = \n2.77, p <0.60). In total, 62% of the respondents were \ncategorized correctly, when using the three predictors \nthat contributed significantly to the prediction of delayed \ndisclosure: age category 12-17 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.13-\n3.73), penetration (OR 2.36, CI 1.25-4.46), and closeness \nto the assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52-4.60). \nDiscussion \nThe results of this study show that, although no dif-\nferences were found between delayed and early disclosers \nin psychological functioning and time to seek help, \ndelayed disclosers were less likely to use medical services \nand to report to the police than early disclosers. \nFurthermore, this study identified a  number of factors \nrelated to the timing of rape disclosure, showing that \ndelayed disclosers represented significantly more adoles-\ncents than young adults, significantly more victims of \npenetration than assault, significantly more victims who \nwere threatened than not threatened, and significantly \nmore victims who were close with the assailant. \nThe finding that delayed disclosers are less likely to \nutilize medical services and report to the police than early \ndisclosers is in line with previous studies in adult women \n(Ahrens et al., 2010; Ullman, 1996; Ullman & Filipas, \n2001). It suggests that disclosure latency is important for \npublic health and safety, as delayed disclosure may not \nonly impede reception of proper medical care, such as \ntreating anogenital injuries and preventing the onset of \nSTDs and unwanted pregnancy (Linden, 2011), but also \nimpede the forensic investigation and apprehension of the \nassailant (Lacy & Stark, 2013). \nThree variables were identified that successfully pre-\ndicted delayed disclosure: age category 12-17 years, \npenetration, and the assailant being a close person. The \nfinding that the victim's age significantly predicts disclo-\nsure latency is in line with previous research showing that \nadolescents are at a  greater risk for delayed disclosure \nwhen compared to their older counterparts (Kogan, 2004; \nSmith et al., 2000). Adolescents may be less able to over-\ncome the barriers to disclose, including factors such as \nassailant tactics for maintaining secrecy, stigma that often \naccompanies rape, and fear that their parents would \nconsequently limit their freedom (Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, \n& Romito, 2004). Also, as victims approach adulthood, \nthey may possess more information about their rights and \noptions after victimization, and have more possibilities for \nwhom to disclose. In our study, most adolescents disclosed \nthe rape event to peers, in line with prior research (Crisma \net al., 2004; Priebe & Svedin, 2008). \nThe use of penetration was found to make victims \nmore likely to postpone disclosure, opposite to the results \nfrom Priebe and Svedin (2008), but in line with an older \nstudy by Arata (1998), who found that more severe forms \nof sexual abuse were associated with less disclosure. \nPenetration may influence disclosure latency through \na variety of mechanisms. It could be argued that more \nsevere rape, indicated by the use of penetration, is more \nlikely to be accompanied by extensive coercive use of \ntactics to maintain the victim's silence, with fear of re-\nprisal possibly contributing to the finding of delayed dis-\nclosure (Kogan, 2004). Also, adolescents may think that \nsocial reactions in response to disclosure are more nega-\ntive in case of completed rape compared to assault. \nAnother factor that seems to make immediate dis-\nclosure of rape less likely is closeness to the assailant, \nas indicated by the assailant being a  (boy)friend, family \nCitation: European Jcumal of Paychouaumacology 2015. 6: 25883 rittp:adidoicrono.34o2tetpt.y6258.83 5 \n(pope tuft., ,or be moon puma* \nEFTA00024215\n\nIva A.

This finding is consistent with pre-\nvious studies showing that the closer the relationship \nbetween the victim and assailant, the less likely the young \nwoman was to report this victimization to anyone (Koss, \n1988; Rickert et al., 2005; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011). \nThe dynamics of intrafamilial abuse is often proposed as \n6 \nimp \nmeow 101 \nMr \nOS*, wpm) \nCrlaten: European Journal of Psycholraumatdogy 2016. 6: 25883 htlp://dxsttorW10.3607Jept.v6.25666 \nEFTA00024216\n\nPredictors of delayed disclosue of rape \nthe explanation for delayed or non-disclosure (Kogan, \n2004; Smith et al., 2000). In the present study, however, \nonly 5% of the assailants were identified as a  family \nmember. Most close relationships referred to (boy)friends, \nsuggesting that a  significant percentage of the sample \nexperienced peer-to-peer victimization. This type of vic-\ntimization is most likely to occur during adolescence, as \ncompared to childhood or young adulthood, and greatly \nincreases the risk of revictimization (Humphrey & White, \n2000). Hence, victims of rape by peers may be a  target \ngroup for interventions promoting early disclosure. \nClearly, there are many variables working in tandem to \naffect the timing of victim's disclosure. A closer look at \nthe final model, which identified three unique variables that \ncontributed significantly to the prediction of delayed dis-\nclosure, can help us to better understand the phenomenon \nof initial disclosure in adolescents and young adults. \nYounger adolescent victims who are raped by a close per-\nson are more likely to delay disclosure than older victims \nof attempted rape by a stranger or acquaintance. Perhaps, \nthey struggle with the notion that someone close to them \nperformed such a  violent act against them, which con-\nfuses them about what might happen in terms of safety \nif they would disclose (or not). This finding is especially \nimportant in the light of the fact that approximately 80% \nof victims had some sort of relationship with their per-\npetrator prior to the assault (Basile, Chen, Black, & \nSaltzman, 2007). With regard to rape types, it would \nintuitively seem that less severe forms of sexual assault \nare associated with delayed disclosure and that completed \nrape would be easier to identify as clearly inappropriate \nand wrong. Victims of completed rape, however, may be \nmore likely to experience negative psychological reac-\ntions, e.g., self-blame and avoidance coping. It is con-\nceivable that they delay their disclosure as a  result of \nrape-induced psychological distress (Starzynski, Ullman, \nFilipas, & Townsend, 2005), not necessarily the severity \nof the assault. \nAlthough the final model showed acceptable goodness \nof fit, the percentage of explained variance of delayed \ndisclosure was modest. Thus. there must be other variables \npredictive of delayed disclosure, such as the assailant's \nuse of alcohol or weaker support systems, that we did not \nassess in this study. Besides this limitation, there are other \ndrawbacks of this study that should be mentioned. First, \na  clinical sample was used with patients reporting high \nmean levels of psychological distress. This ceiling effect \nmay explain why no differences were found between \nearly and delayed disclosers on psychological function-\ning, contrary to prior studies (Broman-Fulks et al., 2007; \nRuggiero et al., 2004). Second, posttraumatic stress was \nonly assessed for children up to 18 years, and for young \nadults additional suitable measures were not used. Third, \ninformation could have been lost due to dichotomizing \nthe variable disclosure latency. Fourth, results may not be \ngeneralizable to all rape victims, because the percentage \nof victims that consulted a  medical professional and \nreported to the police was higher in our sample than in \nmost studies (Hanson et al., 2003; Resnick et al., 2000; \nZinzow, Resnick, Bare, Danielson, & Kilpatrick, 2012). \nPerhaps, these differences could, at least partially, be \nexplained by the fact that stranger rape, representing 30% \nof our sample, leads to higher likelihood of help-seeking \nand police reporting because of its association with higher \nacknowledgment of victim status (Resnick et al., 2000; \nSmith et al., 2000). The fact that this is  a  help-seeking \nsample is critical for the reasons cited in the discussion, \nbut also because the generalizability of these data to rape \nvictims who never tell anyone—perhaps the group most \nat risk—simply cannot be known. Besides these limita-\ntions, several strengths of the current study need to be \nnoted. One strength is the unique set of adolescents and \nyoung adults who presented at a  mental health care \ncentre after a single rape event, but who reported no prior \nchronic sexual abuse in childhood. For 85% of the \nsample, the index trauma was a first time rape. Moreover, \ndata were collected at a  designated referral centre for \nvictims of rape and, therefore, the sample is likely to \nrepresent the clinical population of Dutch victims in the \nage group of 12-25 years. \nThe findings of the current study, suggesting that \ndelayed disclosers are less able to benefit from emergency \nmedical care and evidence collection, have a number of \npractical implications. One of the strategies to enhance \nvictims' willingness to disclose within the first week post-\nrape may be sexual education campaigns in school and \nmedia, as being uninformed is one of the reasons for them \nnot to disclose (Crisma et al., 2004). Education may \ninclude medical information on rape-related pregnancy \nand STDs, as well as the need for timely emergency \ncontraception and prophylaxis, given that these concerns \nappear to be facilitators of seeking medical help (Zinzow \net al., 2012). Also, practical information about DNA evi-\ndence and how to best protect it, e.g., related to shower-\ning, clothing, eating, and drinking, may increase the \nawareness of opportunities in the early-phase post-rape. \nMoreover, facts about the potential psychological impact \nof rape, such as PTSD and revictimization, but also in-\nformation about evidence-based treatments (Elwood et al., \n2011; Littleton & Ullman, 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2013), \nmay increase help-seeking behaviour in an early stage. \nFurthermore, efforts to encourage early disclosure must \nconsider peer-to-peer victimization as a  primary factor, \nas most participants in this study experienced this type \nof victimization, and may initially not have defined or \nacknowledged the incident as rape because they rationalize \nsuch experiences as normal (Hlavka, 2014), leading to the \nfinding of delayed disclosure. \nIn conclusion, the results of the present study suggest \nthat adolescent victims of rape with penetration by \nCitation: Eurccean Journal d  Paychouaumatology 2015. 8: 25883 napiktx.doi.crott0.3402teipt.v8.25883 7 \n(pope number \nnot loe \nOtarken \npu.po.$ \nEFTA00024217\n\ntva A. E. Scant et al. \nsomeone close are at increased risk for delayed disclosure, \nand that delayed disclosers are less likely to use medical \nservices and to report to the police. These findings may \nassist clinicians and policymakers in understanding rape \nand help to develop interventions (Unterhitzenberger & \nRosner, 2014), specifically targeted to support adoles-\ncents and young adults to disclose in an early-phase post-\nrape. Although the vast majority of the participants was \nliving at their parental home, many of the sample did \nnot first disclose to their parents. Therefore, it could be \nargued that in prevention programs specific attention \nshould be given to the strengthening of the child—parent \nrelationship, to facilitate disclosure to parents (Schonbucher \net al., 2012). Next, as victims tend to disclose mostly to \npeers, prevention programmes may need to aim at teach-\ning adolescents how they can help a  peer victim if they \nbecome a  recipient of disclosure (Schonbucher et al., \n2012). In addition, education may increase victims' \nwillingness to disclose early, thereby increasing opportu-\nnities for access to health and police services. It is more \nlikely to reach adolescents with direct, active, and online \noutreach programs via communication channels that are \nfrequently used by adolescents and young adults parti-\ncularly social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, \netc.), forums, and mobile apps. Such programmes, where-\nin adolescents and young adults are being treated as \nagents and decision makers (Hlavka, 2014), should focus \non information concerning what rape actually is—not \nonly the stereotypical idea of rape and what (not) to do in \nthe aftermath of rape especially in the first week post-\nrape. Another way to help improve the support of victims \nof rape is the implementation of multidisciplinary sexual \nassault centres (Bicanic, Snetselaar, De Jongh, & Van de \nPutte, 2014; Bramsen, Elklit, & Nielsen, 2009), as these \nmay be the most suitable places to organize education \ncampaigns and offer integrated post-rape services in one \nlocation. Future research should investigate whether the \navailability of such centres increases the prevalence of police \nreporting and use of medical care. Moreover, as discussed, \nprevious research concerning the topic of disclosure has \nfocused on the disclosure process, mainly the effect of \nnegative social reactions, and not the latency. In future \nresearch, social reactions in relation to disclosure (latency) \nshould be assessed by using the Social Reactions Ques-\ntionnaire, as well as the victim's perception of their own \nexperience being defined as rape, as many girls and young \nwomen do not report or seek help because they regard \nsexual violence against them as normal (Hlavka, 2014). \nConflict of interest and funding \nThere is no conflict of interest in the present study for any \nof the authors. \nReferences \nAchenbach, T.
