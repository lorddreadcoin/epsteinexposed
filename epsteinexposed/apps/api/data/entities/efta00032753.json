Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nDecember 5, 2019 \nBY EMAIL \nScott \nA. Srebnick, Esq. \n201 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 1210 \nMiami, FL \n33131 \nScott@srebnicklaw.com \nRe: United States v. Michael Avenatti, \nSi 19 Cr. 373 (PGG) \nDear Mr. Srebnick: \nWe write in response to your letter dated December 2, 2019, which requests certain \ninformation in light of a New York Times article dated November 30, 2019 concerning Jeffrey \nEpstein and alleged videos, and Episode 22 of The Weekly, a television series of the New York \nTimes, concerning the same. \nIn your letter, you cite Federal Rule of Evidence 16(a)(1)(E)(i), the Due Process Clause, \nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), Giglio v.  United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and their \nprogeny. However, insofar as your request is premised on the proposition that, as you stated in \nthe email enclosing your letter, the information you seek may constitute impeachment material of \npotential Government witnesses associated with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (\"BSF\"), we \nunderstand it  to be a  request solely for impeachment material under Giglio and its progeny. As \nyou are aware, the defendant is not entitled to such material at this time (nor has the Government \nyet determined precisely which witnesses it will call at trial). Rather, the parties have previously \nagreed, in writing, that the Government will provide such material, if any exists, on or before \nJanuary 14, 2020. We are aware of our obligation in this respect, and intend to comply timely. \nIn any event, to the extent that we understand your request, we do not agree that you are \nentitled to what you seek, assuming arguendo that it exists, and assuming further that the \nprosecution team (which is not on any Jeffrey Epstein-related investigation) both had it and was \nat liberty to provide it. See generally United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109 n.16 (1976). We \nalso note that Scott Wilson, Esq. has moved from BSF to DLA Piper. Notwithstanding this view, \nwe are available to confer at your convenience regarding your request, to ensure that we understand \nit fully, and in the interest of seeking to narrow or moot potential disputes in advance of trial. \nPlease be advised, however, that irrespective of the resolution of your request, we expect \nthat we would object to you offering any evidence or argument concerning the above-referenced \nallegations, including during your opening statement or in cross-examination, as both improper \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00032753\n\nPage 2 \nand inflammatory. We accordingly request that, if you intend to raise such allegations in any form \nbefore the jury, you either move in !amine on the present schedule, or, if you have not yet decided \nyour position, you inform us sufficiently advance of trial so that we may confer further and then \nthe matter may be raised with the Court. If you do not agree with this request, please advise \nus. \nVery truly \nyours, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States Attorneys \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00032754",
