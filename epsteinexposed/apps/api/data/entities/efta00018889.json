Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Counsel: \nToday the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and \nGiglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced \ncase. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. \nThe Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the \nGovernment does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. \nThese materials do not contain a  comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the \nGovernment does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials \ncontain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing \nthese materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it \nhas any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. \nMoreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the \nenclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine \nthat it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. \nEFTA00018889\n\nPage 2 \nPlease note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are \ngoverned by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, certain materials are \ndesignated as \"confidential\" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as \n\"confidential,\" because it includes information regarding records designated as \n\"confidential\" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to \ncease the dissemination of materials marked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid \npotential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to \nnote the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this \ncase, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO \nPROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to \nthe specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. \nAdditionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are \nrepresented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to \namend and supplement these disclosures. \nVery truly \nyours, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nby: s/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nEFTA00018890",
