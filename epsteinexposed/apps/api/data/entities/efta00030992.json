A reproduction \nof materials previously produced by the Government on August 12, 2020, which are stamped with \ncontrol numbers SDNY_GM_00086557 through SDNY_GM_00096055 and \nSDNY GM 00164920 through SDNY_GM_00165517 is also included.

Consistent with the Protective Order in this case, the \nGovernment is only producing these \"highly confidential\" materials to defense counsel and is not \nproducing these materials directly to the defendant. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00030992\n\nPage 2 \nPlease note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, \n2020 Protective Order in this case.'

The Government notes that the remainder of the Florida FBI \nFiles in PDF format designated as \"confidential\" under the protective order have been stamped \n\"confidential.\" However, certain files cannot be individually labeled as confidential on the \ndocuments themselves due to their file format. Such files include in their electronic names the \nword \"Confidential.\" \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00030993\n\nPage 3 \nfiles are loaded onto an electronic review platform and will be processed and produced on a rolling \nbasis as part of electronic discovery. \nAdditionally, the Government notes that the physical items referenced in the productions \nto date can be made available for you to review at the FBI New York office, upon request. Those \nphysical items include numerous hard copies of photographs and discs containing photographs, \nwhich were seized during searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences. As a courtesy, the FBI is in \nthe process of scanning those hard copy photographs and copying the photographs contained on \nthe discs. Once that process is complete, the Government intends to produce electronic copies of \nany such photographs that do not contain highly confidential images. Any photographs among \nthose physical items identified as highly confidential will be made available for review at the FBI \nNew York \noffice. \nFinally, the Government wishes to inform you, as a courtesy, that it is in possession of a \ncopy of the FBI's case file regarding the investigation of a former employee of Jeffre E stein's \nnamed for obstruction of justice (the \"=IM File\"). The File is \nmaintained under a different FBI case number from the investigation that led to the charges against \nyour \nclient. The File has no relation to your client and no bearing on the charges in this \ncase. Accordingly, the Government does not intend to produce the File because it  is \nnot discoverable in this case. \nPlease do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if \nyou wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody. \nVery truly \nyours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nActing United States \nAttorney \nAssistant United States Attorneys \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00030994",
