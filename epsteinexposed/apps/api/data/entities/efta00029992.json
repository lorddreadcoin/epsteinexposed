Barr \nUnited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York \nOctober 10, 2019 \nMCC-Epstein Investigation \nandWIMiwill present on \nerr investigation o e  events at t  e e ropo an Correctional \nCenter on August 9-10, 2019, the night that Jeffrey Epstein committed \nsuicide. In the last two months, our Office, along with agents from the \nFBI and \nDOJ-OIG, \nhave interviewed more than 40 witnesses, including \n27 MCC employees and 16 inmates at MCC; reviewed records from the \nMCC as well as financial records for the relevant employees; conducted \nsearches of the cellphones used by certain of the relevant prison guards, \nand reviewed dozens of hours of the limited videotape evidence the FBI \nhas thus far been able to recover in the face of technical data recovery \nissues. \nThe investigation has determined principally that the two prison officers \nresponsible for the SHU area during the night of August 9 and early \nmorning hours of August 10 — Michael Thomas and Tova Noel — did not \nconduct any of the required institutional \"counts\" at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and \n5 a.m., nor did they conduct most of the \"rounds\" they were required to \nconduct every 30 minutes. In particular, it appears that no prison official \nobserved Epstein from approximately 9:30 pm on the evening of August \n9 until his body was discovered at approximately 6:30 a.m. the next \nmorning. Thomas and Noel also falsified numerous forms, indicating \nthat they had performed the required rounds and counts overnight \nalthough they did not actually do so. Instead, Thomas and Noel were \nperforming other tasks, using the computer, talking, or sleeping during \ntheir overnight shift. In addition, the investigation has determined that, \ncontrary to MCC policy and a directive from the Chief Psychologist and \nthen-Warden, Epstein was left without a cellmate from the morning of \nAugust 9 through his death on the morning of August 10. It is not clear \nthat either Thomas or Noel was specifically made aware of the directive, \nalthough Thomas had been on duty in the SHU during Epstein's prior \nsuicide attempt and they were both trained on MCC policy and had the \nability to assign Epstein a new cellmate. \nThe case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit, led by \nCo\n-Chiefs \nEFTA00029992\n\nVisit of Attorney General William P. Barr \nUnited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York \nOctober 10, 2019 \nNine \nTrev \nProsecution \nwill be presenting on this \nimportant gang-violence prosecution, which culminated in a trial \nconviction last week. \nIn the spring of 2018, our Office began an investigation into high-\nranking members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, a violent set of the \nBloods gang. Working with our law enforcement partners from the \nNYPD, HSI, and ATF, the team built a racketeering case against some \nof the highest ranking and most violent members of Nine Trey. Our \ninvestigation resulted in charges against 14 members and associates of \nthe gang, including its leaders and shooters. \nNine Trey was responsible for distributing large amounts of heroin and \nfentanyl, as well as brazen acts of violence across New York City, \nincluding two shootings in Times Square, a shooting inside the Barclays \nCenter, and other shootings, robberies, and slashings near residential \nhousing complexes. Our investigation included the use of multiple \ncooperating witnesses, including a world-famous rap artist, who \npromoted the gang through his music and used the gang for protection \nand to taunt rivals. \nOf the 14 defendants, nine pled guilty; three pled guilty pursuant to \ncooperation agreements; and two were convicted of racketeering and \nnarcotics offenses following trial. \nThe case is being handled by the Office's Violent & Organized Crime \nUnit, led by Co-Chiefsnd \nCo-Chief, Violent & Co-Chief, Violent & \nOrganized Crimes Unit Organized Crime Unit \nEFTA00029993\n\nVisit of Attorney General William P.

The investigation expanded as minor victims \nidentified other minor victims and particular pimps for whom they had \nworked, including pimps who had used significant violence to force them \ninto prostitution. \nAs part of this investigation, the team has charged 19 defendants in eight \nseparate cases, involving dozens of victims. To date, 13 have been \nconvicted, including two following jut,' trials. \nThe case is being handled by the Office's General Crimes Unit, led by \nCo-Chief \nand Acting \nCo\n-Chief\n-\nCo-Chief, General Crimes Unit Acting Co Chief, General Crimes Unit \nEFTA00029994",
