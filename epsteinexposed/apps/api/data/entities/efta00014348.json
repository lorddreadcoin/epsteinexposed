When can we expect to get \neither some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with \nsomeone? \nI  understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, \nand given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please \nadvise. \nThank you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43, > wrote: \nEFTA00014348\n\nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be \nseeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to \nknow as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It \nhas now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a \nwritten report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his \ncounsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. \nPlease advise. \nThank you, \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 08:46,a, (USMS)     wrote: \nPassed away.
