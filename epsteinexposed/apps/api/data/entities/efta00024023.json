    "text": "\n\nGG\nCOHEN & \nGRESSER LLP \nMark S. Cohen \nChristian R. Evendell \nMarch 15, 2021 \nVIA ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District \nCourt \nuthern District of New York \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we will be filing the following reply \nmemoranda with accompanying exhibits: \nI. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Superseding Indictment for \nBreach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement \n2. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Four of \nthe Superseding Indictment as Time-Barred \n3. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion Under the Due Process Clause to Suppress \nAll Evidence Obtained from the Government's Subpoena to and to \nDismiss Counts Five and Six \n4. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six of the \nSuperseding Indictment Because the Alleged Misstatements Are Not Perjurious as a \nMatter of Law \n5. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for a  Severance of and Separate Trial on \nCounts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment \n6. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Strike Surplusage from the Superseding \nIndictment \n7. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One Through Six of the \nSuperseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay \n8. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Either Count One or Count \nThree of the Superseding Indictment as Multiplicitous \n9. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Superseding Indictment as \nIt Was Obtained in Violation of the Sixth Amendment \n10. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for a  Bill of Particulars and Pretrial \nDisclosures \nEFTA00024023\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nMarch 15, 2021 \nPage 2 \nII. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion Under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell, \nand the Fifth Amendment to Suppress All Evidence Obtained from the Government's \nSubpoena to and to Dismiss Counts Five and Six \n12. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Four of \nthe Superseding Indictment for Lack of Specificity \nSeveral of the reply memoranda reference or discuss Confidential Information produced \nin discovery and are therefore redacted pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. \n36). In order to give the government the chance to review the proposed redactions, we will not \nfile on the public docket any reply memoranda that contain redactions until we are instructed to \ndo so by the Court.' \nThe remaining reply memoranda do not contain any redactions. However, we are \nmindful of the fact that the government's Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to the \nDefendant's Pre-trial Motions, to which the reply memoranda respond, has not yet been filed on \nthe public docket. Accordingly, we will also refrain from filing the reply memoranda that do not \ncontain redactions on the public docket until we are instructed to do so by the Court. \nInstead, we will submit by email to the Court and the government all of the reply \nmemoranda and exhibits pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court's individual rules of criminal \npractice. For the reply memoranda and exhibits that contain redactions, we will submit two \nversions — an unredacted original to be kept under seal and a  version for public filing with \nproposed redactions. \nPlease contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated. \nRespectfully submitted, \nIs/ Christian R. Everdell \nChristian R. Everdell \ncc: All counsel of record (via email) \nI For documents that the government has designated as \"Confidential,\" we have preliminarily indicated that they be \nfiled under seal, as required by paragraph 15 of the Protective Order. However, because some of the exhibits are \n\"judicial documents,\" we intend to propose that those \"Confidential\" designations be amended consistent with our \nMarch 9, 2021 letter to the Court. \nEFTA00024024",
