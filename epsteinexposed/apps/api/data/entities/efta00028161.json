The defense has not filed a letter in response to your request to vacate the Court's \nprior order, but I will send you a copy if and when they do. \nRelatedly, our next update regarding Maxwell's conditions of confinement is due to the Court this Friday, February \n5th \nPer the attached order, we need to update Judge Nathan regarding the following topics: \n• Access to discovery (we have discussed this topic repeatedly, and my understanding is there are no material \nchanges here, but we need to confirm) \n• Access to legal mail (confirming Maxwell is receiving her legal mail on the same basis as all other inmates) \n• Access to legal email (confirming that Maxwell has access to email with legal counsel via the BOP desktop \ncomputer) \nEFTA00028161\n\n• Ability to communicate with legal counsel (confirming the frequency with which Maxwell receives legal calls and \nVTCs) \n• The frequency of searches of Maxwell (including all patdowns, mouth searches, ear searches, strip searches, \nbody scans, cell searches, and nighttime monitoring) \nIs there a time in the next couple days when we could have a quick phone call to check in on these topics, please? \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nl  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00028162",
