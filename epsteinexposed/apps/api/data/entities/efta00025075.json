We really appreciate you looking into this for us. To confirm, you searched the DOB and document \nnumbers for the three individuals? Thanks again) \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 29, 2021 9:47 PM \nTo: \nCc :\nSubject: RE: CBP Question \nHey.. \nAs discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in \nCBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for \nMaxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. \nHowever, if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date \nrange you looking for. \nEFTA00025076\n\nSince has two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were \nprovided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel \ncrossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in \nchronological order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review \nher travel rather than going back and forth between the two PDFs. \nIf you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't \nhesitate to reach out! \nRespectfully, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nTask Force Officer - SDNY \nUS Attorney's Office \n(LES/FOUO) LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWARNING: \nThe information contained in this email is considered confidential and sensitive in nature as well as sensitive but \nunclassified and/or legally privileged information.
