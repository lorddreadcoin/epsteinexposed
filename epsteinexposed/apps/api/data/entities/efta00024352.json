The Warden is preparing the formal letter for the Court, in which your office, the USMS, USPO, and \nlead counsel are cc'ed. Do you have an email address for him/her? \nThank you, \nSupervisory Staff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetro olitan Correctional Center \nNew York New York 10007 \n>  8/10/2019 11:30 AM > » \nIt is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we \ncan relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can \npass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? \nI understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the \nBOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. \nThank you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43, \n> \nwrote: \nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information \nin the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic \nfacts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. \nPlease advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get \nthat information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information \nthan the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nEFTA00024352\n\nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 08:46, \n> \nwrote: \nPassed away. We are completing a significant incident report for HQ for Death of a Federal Inmatehowever, I do not \nhave any specifics from the BOP yet. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 8:44 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Automatic reply: Epstein update \nThank you for telling us. What do you mean by \"passed\"? \nThanks, \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 8:18 AM, \n> \nwrote: \nBOP just provided another update- Epstein has passed. I have no additional info. I will push out updates as we \nreceive. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:52 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: Automatic reply: Epstein update \nFYI: \nThe BOP just informed us that Epstein is being taken by ambulance to the hospital from another apparent suicide \nattempt- no other information was provided. \nThey will update us as more info becomes available. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 7:26 AM, \n> \nwrote: \nI will be out of the office on vacation until Monday, August 12th.
