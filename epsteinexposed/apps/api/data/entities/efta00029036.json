I'm printing now and will have these out ASAP! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 2, 2020 9:05 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nThank you! These are all good to go, please go ahead and send these out. \nAlso, would you please pdf them and send back to me so I can email the attorney letter to the attorneys and the MDC \nletters to legal counsel at the MDC? \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 2, 2020 9:01 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nAttached are the three letters (so sorry to make you look at a screen again, !) \n• \"Maxwell Discovery Letter\" —  contains password; to be loaded on each drive and then emailed to the attorneys \n• \"Maxwell MAIN\" —  to be printed and mailed with Maxwell's drive to MDC \n• \"Maxwell PASSWORD\" — contains password; to be mailed in a separate envelope to MDC \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 2, 2020 8:43 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nThank you! What's your desk number? I just want to talk the next steps through (I'm a little fried and want to make sure \nI'm absorbing everything) \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 2, 2020 8:42 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nGreat, thank you! \nBoth drives have finished loading; Maxwell's drive contains the Reproductions, the Fourth Production, and VLC. The \nattorneys' drive contains the Fourth Production and VLC (just in case). I will update the cover letter with the password for \nEFTA00029036\n\nthe drives and print two copies, one for Maxwell (sent in a separate envelope) and one for the attorneys. \nDo you have a specific address for Maxwell at the MDC? I can get these out by 9am, I believe —thanks so much! \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 8:54 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nPerfect, thank you very much! Maxwell's drive should be FedEx'd to the MDC. The drive should be in one envelope and a \ncover letter with the password should be sent by a different FedEx envelope. The attorneys' drive can be left for pick-up. \nFine to produce these tomorrow. Just let me know when they've finished loading. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 6:52 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell - discovery production \nHi \nall, \nThe cover letter (attached) has been updated with instructions for viewing those problem files, if you'd like to review. \nMaxwell's drive is still copying; when and how are these to be picked up? It likely will be pretty late tonight that her drive \nfinishes, and then I can start on the drive for the defense. \nThanks! \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 4:37 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: US v.

In order to produce these, we will need two hard drives —  one for production to you and one for \nproduction to the MDC. Would you please provide us with drives to load? For the MDC production, please let us know \nif you would like us to ask the MDC to send us one of the drives that we previously sent to your client for us to load with \nthe new materials. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nI  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00029039",
