Combined edits from both of us, attached. Can you take a look and clean up —  we would then like to \ngive at least the option of weighing in before we send to defense counsel. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 11:44 AM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nCc: \nSubject: RE: draft response to Epstein defense preservation requests \n) \n(USANYS) < \nWanted to bump this from Tuesday, especially since I know you guys are out tomorrow — hopefully we can send it out \ntoday? Happy to incorporate any edits etc. Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 06, 2019 15:01 \nTo: (USANYS) < \nCc:\n1 \nSubject: RE: draft response to Epstein defense preservation requests \n) \n>; \n(USANYS)  \nThis has been in the works for a little while, due to various other things that have come up in the interim, but we didn't \nwant it to get lost given the discovery motion schedule.
