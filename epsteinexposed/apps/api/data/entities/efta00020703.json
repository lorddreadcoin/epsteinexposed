Hi Brad! How you guys doing? \nJS: We're doing fine, \nthank you. I'm sorry for all of the \ntrouble and before we go any \nfurther, let me \ntell you, if I  have your permission, I \nhave started a  tape recorder and I \nwant to be \nable to tape this conversation from the very \nbeginning. Is that alright with \nyou? \n▪ Sure, that's fine, Jack. No problem \nJS: Ok, \ngood, thank you. I  appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I  know \nthat Brad has spoken to you about \nme but I  am Brad's lawyer, and I  assume \nthat you can \nconfirm that you and I  have \nnever had any communication before. Is that right? \n▪ That's correct. \nJS: Alright. I  have, however, \ngotten some information from Brad about conversations that \nyou have had with him, and that \nwill enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit \nmore \nefficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information \nthat we think is going to be \nhelpful to us and to any jury that \nmight ultimately have to \nhear these facts. \nSo, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is. \nThat's my maiden name. My married name is \nGovernment Exhibit C \nCase No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA \nEFTA00020706\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 290-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/20/2015 Page 5 of 8 \nEdwards adv. Epstein \nTelephone interview with\n-\nPage 17 of \n23 \nYes, he did. He did all the \ntime. The worst one that I  heard \nfrom his own mouth was this \npretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his \nbirthday. It  was a surprise birthday gift \nfrom one \nof his friends and they were from \nFrance. I  did see them, I  did meet \nthem. \nJeffrey bragged afterwards after \nhe met them that they were 12 \nyear olds and flown over \nfrom France because \nthey're really poor over there, and their \nparents needed the money \nor whatever the case is and \nthey were absolutely free to stay \nand flew out. Those were \nthe worst ones. He was constantly bragging about \ngirls' ages or where he got them from \nor \ntheir past and how terrible their past was \nand good he is making it for them. \nJS: Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from \nFrance? Where did they come to? \nII Palm Beach. \nJS: And were they flown in on \nJeff's private plane or did they get \ntransported? \nNo. They \nwere transported by somebody else. \nJS: Ok. Was the sexual activity that \nwent on on the airplane conducted in such a \nway so that \nany of the crew was aware of \nwhat was going on? \nThey were told \nto knock if they had to come out, if \nthe crew had to come out. They were \ntold, \nyou know, to come out as little as \npossible, so they weren't out there hanging \nout \nwatching everything, no, \nbut it doesn't take an idiot to put \ntwo and two together to say \nwell there's a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on \nboard with this old man who is \nconstantly being massaged by them and he \nwants me to keep the door shut for what \nreason? I mean, only they could put that \ntogether, but yeah, they knew. \nJS: Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to \nyou about people of power and \ninfluence owing him favors? \nHe would laugh about it, you know, I never \nreally knew what to take serious from Jeffrey \nbecause he was such a funny character at \ntimes. You never knew if what he was saying \nwas true or not. \nYeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He's got \neverybody in his pocket, and \nhe would laugh about he helps \npeople for the sole purpose \nin the end they owe him something. That's why I  believe he does so \nmany favors in the \nfirst \nplace. \nJS: When and how did you first become \naware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law? \nI  was first informed by, I \nthink someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask \nme questions, and I started to \nanswer the questions but then fear \ntook over, and I just said \nlook, \nI don't know what's going on, I've got a young family that I don't want to risk, \nyou \nknow, please don't \nbother me about this again, and it was \nreal short simple conversation, \nand within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey's \nattorney, and then a week later, \nJeffrey \nhimself. \nGovernment Exhibit C \nCase No. 08480736-CIV-MARRA \nEFTA00020707\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 290-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/20/2015 Page 6 of 8 \nEdwards adv. Epstein \nTelephone interview with-\nPage 18 of 23 \nJS: Ok, well let's back up \nbefore we get to those conversations and tell me \napproximately \nwhen it was that you were \ncontacted by the person who you believe \nwas with the FBI. \nOk. \nIt's hard for me to pinpoint, if I had to \npinpoint it, it would be in 2007 sometime. \nJS: Alright. And you were living in \nat that time, correct? \nCorrect. \nJS: You were contacted by telephone? \nThat's correct, by my cell phone. \nJS: \nOk and do you have any idea how your name \ncame up leading to that contact. \nNo idea. No idea \nwhatsoever. When I  did ask, I  was told that some girls had revealed \nmy name, I guess, and that's \nhow everybody, the FBI knew \nto contact me. \nJS: \nOK. \nBut I don't know offhand or \nsorry, I just walked into the wrong room. \nJS: Ok. \nSorry go \non. \nJS: Yes & I'll never tell her you said that. how long was it \nafter that phone call \nfrom \nthe FBI person were you contacted by \nMr. Epstein's lawyers. \nLike a week. It was \nback to back to each other. I remember being so scared after talking \nto the FBI thinking what's \nhappening, what's going on. It's been like \n6 years, 7 years at \nthat stage, how did they find me & what do I  have to do with this? So yeah, I  do \nremember that very well, and it was only \nabout a week later I was called by his attorney. \nJS: \nWho was it that contacted you, \ndo you remember? \nI want to say \nBill Riley, but he might have been from the FBI. No, it was Bill Riley. Bill \nRiley. Not sure if that's \nhis correct name, but that's what is \ncoming to mind \nJS: What do you \nremember about that conversation? \nI\n: I \nremember a Mr. Goldberger as well, I \nremember, there might have been two of them. \nJS: \nAlright. \nGovernment Exhibit C \nCase No. 08480736-CIV-MARRA \nEFTA00020708\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 290-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/20/2015 Page 7 of 8 \nEdwards adv. Epstein \nTelephone interview with \nPage 19 of 23 \nII\nI can't remember which one it was. I want to say Bill Riley is the good one. \nIS: Alright, so either Bill Riley or a Mr. Goldberger or both of them contacted you, and what \ndo you remember about that? \nI don't know if it was the same guy who contacted me that week later who put me in \ntouch \nwith Jeffrey. I think he was on the phone and he put speakerphone on with Jeffrey. \nSo he connected me with Jeffrey. I don't know if it was the same guy or different, but I \ndefinitely know that Bill Riley was the first guy to \ncontact me. I'm pretty sure about that. \nJS: Ok. Tell me about that conversation. \nII\nHe asked me what I knew about what's going on with Jeffrey and \napparently, there was \nan investigation being held about some of the girls who \nhad come out and said that \nJeffrey had sexual contact with them under \nthe age of a  minor and that he was \ndiscrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes and \nwhat have you so they \nwouldn't be looked upon as worthy in the court's eyes so to \nspeak. \nAnd you know, he told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that \n\"I'll be looked after\" .  And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn't like you \nknow, \nI'm gonna pay you a \nzillion dollars or anything if you be quiet, but if I stay quiet, I would \n\"looked after\". And I remember saying I don't want any part to do with this. You know, \nthis is not something I want to be a part of, I've got a young family. I wish the best for \neverybody in this, you know, take care kind of thing. A week later, I was called after the \nhearing by one of Jeffrey's lawyers. I can't tell you exactly which one it was \nbut he had \nJeffrey on the other line and he connected Jeffrey and I, and Jeffrey tried to make some \nsimple conversation, \"How are you? \nHow have things been?\" You know what I  mean, \ncatching \nup. \nJS: Do you know if the lawyer, did the lawyer stay on the line while Jeffrey \nwas speaking to \nyou? \nI'm pretty sure he did. That's why I  think Jeffrey was on speaker phone bera'ise it \nsounded a lot different, and I was never taken off the \nline to begin with or connected to \nanother line, so I  was pretty sure \nJeffrey was on speaker phone and the lawyer was \nmaking the call. After the simple conversation, it led to what was going on again and you \nknow, Jeffrey couldn't believe it. You know, he thought he helped \nall these girls out. He \ndidn't think he was wrong in any circumstance here at all. A lot of these girls were drug \naddicts and just after drug money. You \nknow, he was really putting down these women \nor these girls I should say, not giving them the credit they deserved, and then he exactly \nrepeated what the lawyer said the week before is that he would \nlook after me if I stayed \nquiet, and if I need any help, \nyou know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get \nlegal help for me, whatever I need, he would do, and I told him \nexactly, I said, \"Jeffrey, \nI'm the mother of two children at that stage. I'm \naway from everything there, I don't \nwant to be a part of it. I'm not going to speak to anybody and I don't want to speak to \nanybody, I don't want to be involved.\" That was the last time I heard from him. And the \nGovernment Exhibit C \nCase No. 08.80736-CIV-MARRA \nEFTA00020709\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 290-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/20/2015 Page 8 of 8 \nEdwards adv. Epstein \nTelephone interview with\n-\nPage 20 of 23 \nnext thing I knew, I was sent my victim's letter, \nmy notification of being a victim through \nthe US Attorney's Office and that's when I knew it was \nwell out there enough not to have \nJeffrey's lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all \nthe other girls. So, I \ncalled up Joseph Bird who was the recommended \nlawyers on my \npaperwork that they had given \nme and started going from there. \nJS: So you contact Mr. Joseph Bergs' office and \nthen you were dealing with his office from \nthat point forward. \nThat's correct. \nJS: Tell me about \nthe ending of your relationship with \nJeffrey. That is, at what point in time \ndid your full time employment end and how did that happen? \nOk. So, it hadn't \nreally ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand \nwhere I met my husband and escaped to Australia, \nnever to return back to the states. \nAbout 6  months prior to that, he came up with a \nproposition that I  thought was really \ndisgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I \nhad been with \nhim that nothing was going \nto change and I was always just going to be used by \nhim(?) \nwhich I did not like. He \noffered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I \nforget what he called it, a monthly income of \nwhat he made to bear one of his children. \nThe proposition was that if anything ever happened \nbetween Jeffrey and I, that I would \nhave to sign my child over to \nhim basically and that the child would be \nhis and \nGhislaine's, and I \nwould be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey \nand I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey \nmore to please get me \nsome more \ntraining, you \nknow, \nand I was getting \nolder and not of as much interest to \nJeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to \nThailand, in September 2002_. I was \nfirst supposed to meet a girl there and \nbring her \nback with \nme, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai \nmassage \nso that was to shut me up about my training so I went \nthere, and one of my friends from \nschool \ninvited me to watch a fight, like a  muay thai \nfight, which is like a  form \nkickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a \nreally good fighter, \nand a girl's word, looked \nreally hot, so I asked my friend who knew \nhim to introduce me. \nWe got \nintroduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later proposed and 7 \ndays \nlater I was being married in a buddist \ntemple. I called Jeffrey and told him I'm \nsorry, I'm \nnever coming back. I've gotten married, \nI've fallen in love. I thought he'd wish the best \nfor me but he was kind of rude and he just said \"have a good \nlife\" and hung up the phone, \nand that was \nthe last time I'd talked to him ever \nuntil all this started again. \nJS: Ok. is there \nanything else that you would like to add to \nwhat you have told us \nup to \nthis point in time? \nI'd like to know \nthat this time around something's going to be done about it and that \nJeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how \nrich they are, will know that there is \nGovernment Exhibit C \nCase No. 08.80736-CIV-MARRA \nEFTA00020710",
