Mr. Epstein is only supposed to go directly from jail to work and back. If he deviates from that \nroute, right now no alarms will go off unless, during that deviation, he enters an exclusionary zone. If, for \nexample, his driver breaks the rules and takes him for a tour of Royal Palm Beach while en route to Mr. \nGoldberger's office, and that tour takes him near one of the programmed addresses, the alarm will go off. I don't \nknow what the radius is for the exclusionary zone, but, if the alarm were to go off, Mr. Epstein would know that \nhe is near one of the prohibited places, but wouldn't know whose address it was and whether the address was \ntheir home, place of work, or place of study. \nIf you need more detail, I will need to reach out to Captain Sleeth, and I am happy to do so. \nThank you. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nWest Palm Beach, FL \n33401 \nPhone \nFax \nFrom: ROBERT C.

Captain Sleeth from the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office informs me that the \ninformation will remain confidential and will not be provided to Mr. Epstein. \nCaptain Sleeth has asked that all such requests go through me rather than directly to him.
