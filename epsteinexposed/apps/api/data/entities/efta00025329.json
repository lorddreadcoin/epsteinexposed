As \nI'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, \nwhich also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might \nbe willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to \ndo it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any \nquestions at all.
