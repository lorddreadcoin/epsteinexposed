    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nLW 1O1x, JVPW mr. \nNovember 3, 2021 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nAttached please find the parties' joint request to charge and proposed verdict sheet. The \nGovernment is docketing a redacted version today and submitting the unredacted versions to the \nCourt. The redline text in the documents reflect the objections of the defense. Further detail of \nthe parties' objections are contained in comment bubbles. \nThe Government has proposed the only redactions in the Request to Charge. These \nproposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in \nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government's \nrequest to charge is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the \nproposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of a third party. \nThe Government is also providing under seal Exhibit A, which pertains to a  defense \ncomment. The defense informs the Government that this exhibit is a document from another case \nEFTA00018881\n\nPage 2 \nthat was not itself publicly docketed and therefore is submitting Exhibit A under seal. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  s/ \nMIE \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nCc: Defense \nCounsel (By ECF) \nEFTA00018882",
