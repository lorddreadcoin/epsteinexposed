We also note that we included questions about sexual contact because it is our very general understanding from you \nthat abuse occurred, but we do not make any presumptions about what happened, if anything, separate from what your \nclient recalls. On that note, as we've discussed, but to reiterate, if there are any questions or topics your client is \nuncomfortable addressing, there will be no pressure from us to do so, including at this early stage. \nWith those caveats, possible questions are below, and please let us know if it would be useful for us to chat again before \nyou talk with your client, or otherwise please let us know when it would next be appropriate to check in. \nQuestions / topics: \n1) General background queries: Where did you grow up? How far did you go in school? What is your date of birth? \nHow generally would you describe your upbringing and early professional life? \n2) How did you initially meet Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and how old were you at that time? What was the \nnature of your work with them, and did the role change over time? How long did you work for Maxwell and/or \nEpstein? \n3) In general, what kinds of tasks did you perform for Maxwell or Epstein, and in what locations? Did you travel with \neither of them? When you weren't traveling with them, where did you reside? Did you ever reside with Maxwell or \nEpstein? If so, where — in what locations and at which properties? \n4) Did there come a time when Epstein and/or Maxwell engaged in sexual contact with you? If so, how did that \nhappen the first time? Were there sexualized discussions or was there sexualized conduct leading up to any first \nincident? \n5) Were there other instances when you experienced sexual abuse or sexual contact while working for Maxwell? If so, \nhow did those incidents occur? Did they occur with Epstein alone, or was Maxwell ever directly involved in the \nsexual contact? Did Maxwell ever observe, or was she present for, sexual contact that she herself was not \nparticipating in? Were any other individuals present or participating? \n6) Were you aware of any other girls or women who were subject to sexual abuse or contact by Epstein and/or \nMaxwell, and if so, who? Did you ever see Epstein or Maxwell involved in sexual or other intimate contact with \nother girls you believed or suspected may have been under the age of 18? And if so, under what circumstances \n(when, where, etc.)? \n7) How did your interactions with Epstein and Maxwell end? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you \nwhen Epstein was under investigation in 2006-08? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you during \nthe New York investigation in 2018-20? If so, what was the nature of that contact? When is the last time you spoke \nwith or otherwise interacted with Epstein and/or Maxwell? \nthank you, \nEFTA00020775\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFieldfisher, Riverbank House, London EC4R 3TT. \nwww.fieldfisher.com \nWe do not intend to change our bank details. \nII \nyou receive any communicabon that any of our bank details have changed. telephone us and speak to your \ncontact at our office before transferring any funds.
