On Monday we have the NYCHA meeting with the Brass. The team circulated the relevant materials by \nemail earlier this week. \nRobert Adams Arrest.  At some point next week we expect to arrest Robert Adams, a guard at MCC who we \nindicted yesterday with bribery in connection with an incident last year when he caught a woman smuggling in \ncontraband, and told her she wouldn't get in trouble if she went to a motel and had sex with him, which she did. \nThe FBI is working on the details and exact timing of the arrest; we are exploring whether an arrest at MCC or a \nvoluntary surrender would be appropriate. (If the name sounds familiar, Adams was working in the SAMS unit the \nnight of Epstein's suicide, and we interviewed him and got him appointed counsel in connection with that \ninvestigation; this charge spun out of that). We plan to do a press release. \nHave a nice weekend! \nFrom: =, (USANYS)\nSent: Friday, September 18, 2020 8:52 AM \nTo: \nSubject: the week ahead \nHappy National Cheeseburger Day! Enjoy lunch (breakfast?), and then please promptly turn your attention to letting me \nknow what's happening in your unit next week. \nThanks as always. \nP.S.
