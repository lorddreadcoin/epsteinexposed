RICHARD M. BERMAN, \nDistrict Judge \nAPPEARANCES \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern \nDistrict of New York \nBY: \nAssistant United \nStates Attorneys \nMARTIN G. WEINBERG \nAttorney for Defendant \nSTEPTOE & JOHNSON, LLP \nAttorneys for Defendant \nBY: \nMICHAEL \nC. MILLER \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020203\n\nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nTHE COURT: So, today's conference was scheduled at \nthe end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date. \nI thought that we would devote at least the -- well, probably \nmost of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in \nthis case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if \nthey could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which \nwould include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc. \nDoes anybody want to let me know how you made out? \nMS. §§§: Yes, your \nHonor. \nWe have \nconferred with defense counsel and talked \nabout a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to \npropose to the court today a schedule for discovery, \nfor \ndiscovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are \nalso prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. \nTHE COURT: \nOkay. What have you got in mind? \nMS. III: So, with respect to discovery, we would \npropose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete \ndiscovery, with one \nexception. There are materials from \ndevices seized from the defendant's residence in \nNew York, and \nthe F.B.I. is beginning the \nprocess of reviewing that data. \nIn discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun \nto discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. \nIt's \npossible that process may take longer than October 31. But \naside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting \na schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020204\n\n.5 \nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nFor discovery-related motions, we would propose that \nthe defense file any motions that they are aware of relating to \ndiscovery, to include motions relating to the nonprosecution \nagreement, by September 13 --\nTHE COURT: By when? \nMS. September 13, your \nHonor. \n-- that the government be permitted to respond by \nOctober 4; with any reply due on October 11, as necessary. \nOf course we understand that if the defense comes to \nhave additional motions related to discovery based on the \nongoing \ndiscovery process that we will confer and propose an \nadditional briefing schedule beyond that, as necessary. But \nwith respect to motions that the defense is already aware of, \nincluding the \nNPA, that is the schedule that we would propose \nat this time. \nRegarding pretrial \nmotions, your Honor, we would \npropose that the defense file their motions by January 10, \nthat \nthe government be permitted to respond by February 10, and that \nany replies be due on or before February 24. \nTHE \nCOURT: Got it. \nMS. ill: And finally, your \nHonor, we are prepared to \ndiscuss a trial date in this case. The \ngovernment is asking \nthe court to set a trial date in this matter. We would propose \nthat the court schedule this matter for trial in \nJune of next \nyear, and we estimate that the trial would take approximately \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020205\n\nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nfour to six weeks, and so that trial date \nwould carry into \nJuly. \nAnd I understand that the defense has some comments \nabout that proposal, but that's the government's \nproposal with \nrespect to a trial date. \nTHE COURT: \nOkay. Let me hear from the defense. \nDo I understand it correctly that, with the exception \nof the trial date, those dates are agreeable? \nMR. WEINBERG: Those \ndates are agreeable, your Honor. \nTHE \nCOURT: Counsel, whatever you wish to add, that \nwould be \nfine. \nMR. WEINBERG: We \nwould ask the court to set a \npreliminary trial date \nimmediately after Labor Day. I say \npreliminary because we want time to assess Mr. Epstein's \nTHE COURT: \nThis year? \nMR. WEINBERG: \nYes. \nTHE COURT: This \nLabor Day. Okay. \nMR. WEINBERG: We want time \nto assess Mr. Epstein's \nability to .  . \n(Counsel \nconfer) \nMR. WEINBERG: I'm sorry. I am \nbeing told that your \nHonor was \ninquiring as to the year. Let me --\nTHE \nCOURT: Yes. I thought you wanted a speedy trial, \nand \nso \n--\nMR. WEINBERG: Not with a four- to six-week trial \nwith \ndiscovery coming in October, Judge. I apologize for being \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020206\n\n5 \nj7v2espC kjc \nimprecise. Labor Day 2020 or \nimmediately \nthereafter. And I \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmake that recommendation -- we haven't received the discovery \nyet. Understandably, it is \ncoming, and I'm not in any way \ncontesting that there has been a delay, but we haven't had an \nopportunity to start reviewing what the \ngovernment has \npredicted to be over a million pages of \ndiscovery with \nMr. Epstein and to assess Mr. Epstein's ability to exercise his \nconstitutional \nright, while at MCC, in assisting counsel \nprepare for a very difficult case that addresses events that it \nis alleged occurred 14 to 17 years ago. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nMR. WEINBERG: So, we need time to receive \na million \npages of discovery and to prepare to defend a four- to six-week \ntrial, when a lot of \nthe immediate attention is going to be on \nthe very \nunique and complex constitutional issues connected to \nthe nonprosecution agreement, our contention that the \ngovernment's allegations are inextricably intertwined and \nconstitutionally barred by the NPA. There are double jeopardy \nissues both connected to the conspiracy count, which looks to \nbe an overlap with one of the charges that was \nexpressly within \nthe immunity provisions in the \nNPA. We are going to be \nspending a lot of time, and that's why I agreed with the \ngovernment that we should make early discovery motions on the \nNPA-related issues, on double-jeopardy-related issues, so that \nwe could not only facially brief the motion to dismiss, but \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020207\n\nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nhave the discovery, the subfacial \ndiscovery, if you will, so \nthat we could make a \ncomprehensive briefing along the lines of \nthe schedule for motions. \nTHE COURT: \nThat's what I was going to suggest, if \nthere is \na time period when you could put it all together, as \nit were, and there is a \nlot of flexibility. So I will leave \nthese dates, you \nknow, for now. \nWith respect to the trial date, I could accommodate \neither June or September of 2020. The issue is not so much as, \nfrom my point of view, when you \nare all ready, but what part of \nthe calendar I block out. So is it realistic to block out time \nin \nJune? \nMR. WEINBERG: I think it is -- I don't \nwant to have \nthe court block out a six-week time and then come to the court \nin March and say we \nneed a continuance and risk a September \ndate. \nTHE \nCOURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you \nare saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic. \nMR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months \nsounds like the amount \nof time \nthat we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this \nmagnitude and scope. \nTHE COURT: All right. That is fine for me. \nJust while we are taking care of details, a speedy \ntrial issue \nor application? Why don't we extend it to \nSeptember of 2020? \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020208\n\nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMR. WEINBERG: This case certainly \nmeets all of the \nstatutory criteria for complexity and we would agree to that \nextension, Judge. \nMS. §§§: \nYour Honor, may I briefly be heard with \nrespect to the trial date? \nTHE COURT: Oh, sure. You know, it does sound like it \nis kind \nof premature, but I'm happy to hear you. It is often \nthe defense that is ahead of the government, or not often, but \nequally, but here it is the other way around. So if the \ndefense is not ready, it would be my practice to defer to the \ndefense, but I don't know that it is fixed in stone either \nway. \nBut, sure, I am happy to hear you. \nMS. ill: Your Honor, by way of background, we had \ninitially proposed to the defense a May trial date. We think \nthat there is a public interest in bringing this case to trial \nas swiftly as manageable. We understand, given their concerns \nin wanting to have \nmore time, we proposed a date in June as a \ncompromise \nposition. We understand if the defense has \nindicated that they need additional time. We are sensitive to \nthose concerns. But we do have a concern about the notion of \nsetting a September trial date and that that trial would be \npreliminary or as a \nplaceholder. Thirteen months is a \nconsiderable amount of time for a case of this nature to go to \ntrial; and, again, given \nthe time period of the charged conduct \nand the length of time that's passed, we do think that there is \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020209\n\nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \na public interest in scheduling a fixed trial date in this \ncase. Of course we understand if issues \narise in the interim, \nwe will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes \nsense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't \nthink that any delay in \nthis case is in the public interest. \nTHE \nCOURT: Counsel. \nMR. WEINBERG: We think that the delay in bringing \nthis charge, \nyour Honor, the natural corollary of that is to \nmake it more \ndifficult, not easier, for us to defend \nMr. Epstein. For \ninstance, there are certain sealed files for \npotential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to \nseek to unseal. There is an NPA to litigate. This case is not \nyour ordinary 1591 case. A case of four to six weeks is not \nthe ordinary \namount of time the government takes to prosecute, \nwhether it is old or new cases. We \nneed 13 months. I'm trying \nto make a \nprincipled argument, Judge, that that would be a \nschedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our \nability to work with Mr. Epstein \nunder the current conditions. \nThank you, \nsir. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nSo, we are going to monitor the case \nfrom now until \nthen anyway, so I think \neverybody will be in a better position \nto know \nwhat is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will \nexclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, \nof course, is without prejudice to hearing from \nthe defense and \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020210\n\n9 \nj7v2espC kjc \nthe government as to actually where things \nstand. Long before \nthen we will know. So we will have a \nconference, or several, \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbetween now and then. Let's see where everybody is as the \nmonths go \nby, and then we will know when we can effectively \nhold the \ntrial. \nSo I am going \nto find, under 18 United States Code \n3161, that the request for adjournment, joined in by both \nsides, is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned \ntime from Speedy Trial calculations. I further find that \nthe \nexclusion is designed to prevent any possible miscarriage of \njustice, to facilitate these proceedings, including \nextensive \npretrial preparation, and to guarantee effective representation \nof and preparation by counsel for both sides, and thus the need \nfor exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of \nthe public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 \nUnited States Code E. 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B).  So that exclusion \ngoes to June 8, \n2020 preliminarily. \nCounsel, is it your thought that these motions would \nbe on submission or did you want to have oral \nargument with \nrespect to any aspect of them? \nMR. WEINBERG: We would seek \noral argument, your \nHonor. \nTHE COURT: So let's set October 28, 2019 for oral \nargument, and I am \ntentatively reserving some time on my \ncalendar, as I said before, on June 8, \n2020, but I will have \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020211\n\nIC \nj7v2espC kjc \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmuch better feel for where things are long before that and \ncertainly I would say on October 28 we would have a much \nclearer \npicture of how things stand. \nSo there you have it. Did you have -- go ahead. \nMS. §§§: Just to clarify, your \nHonor, what time would \nthe court like the parties to appear on October 28? \nTHE COURT: \n10 a.m. \nMS. §§§: Thank \nyou, your Honor. \nTHE \nCOURT: And the June 8 date is 9 a.m. Okay? \nMR. WEINBERG: Would your \nHonor want to schedule an \nargument on the substantive motions that will be fully \nbriefed \nbefore the court on February 24? \nTHE \nCOURT: Yup. \nSo let's schedule that oral \nargument for March 12, \n2020, at 10 a.m. \nGreat. So anything anybody else has to talk about? \nMR. WEINBERG: Not from the \ndefense, your Honor. \nMS. III: Not from the \ngovernment, your Honor. Thank \nyou. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nMR. WEINBERG: Thank you very much, \nsir. \nTHE \nCOURT: Nice to see you all. \noOo \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00020212",
