I've attached the relevant AT&T records for your reference. The specific calls to \nare on April 23, 2004 and May 2, 2004 and are located on pages 9 and12 of the attached records. \nnumber at that time was and it appears in the \"Number Called\" column for entries on those two dates. \nI've updated the order of proofer to reflect that we need an AT&T custodian (instead of Cingular/T-Mobile). \nThanks! \nEFTA00022488",
