The charges set forth \nherein stem from the role \nof GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation \nand abuse \nof multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In \nparticular, from at least \nin or about 1994, up to and including \nat least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among \nother things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, \nand ultimately \nabuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under \nthe age \nof 18. The victims were as young as 14 years \nold when they were \ngroomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew \nthat certain victims \nwere in fact under the age of 18. \n2. \nAs a part and in furtherance of their scheme \nto \nabuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to \nEFTA00010993\n\nEpstein's residences in \ndifferent states, which MAXWELL knew \nand \nintended would result in their grooming \nfor and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal \nher crimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned \nabout her conduct, \nincluding in relation to \nsome of the minor victims described \nherein, \nwhen providing testimony under \noath in 2016. \nFACTUAL \nBACKGROUND \n3. During the time periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and \nprofessional \nrelationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his \nclosest \nassociates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and \nin or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with \nEpstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and \nEpstein were photographed together \non multiple occasions, \nincluding in the below image: \n2 \nEFTA00010994\n\n4. \nBeginning \nin \nat \nleast \n1994, \nGHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, \nthe \ndefendant, \nenticed \nand \ngroomed \nmultiple \nminor \ngirls \nto \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nJeffrey \nEpstein, \nthrough \na \nvariety \nof \nmeans \nand \nmethods, \nincluding \nbut \nnot \nlimited \nto \nthe \nfollowing: \na. \nMAXWELL \nfirst \nattempted \nto \nbefriend \nsome \nof \nEpstein's \nminor \nvictims \nprior \nto \ntheir \nabuse, \nincluding \nby \nasking \nthe \nvictims \nabout \ntheir \nlives, \ntheir \nschools, \nand \ntheir \nfamilies. \nMAXWELL \nand \nEpstein \nwould \nspend \ntime \nbuilding \nfriendships \nwith \nminor \nvictims \nby, \nfor \nexample, \ntaking \nminor \nvictims \nto \nthe \nmovies \nor \nshopping. \nSome \nof \nthese \noutings \nwould \ninvolve \nMAXWELL \nand \nEpstein \nspending \ntime \ntogether \nwith \na \nminor \nvictim, \nwhile \nsome \nwould \ninvolve \nMAXWELL \nor \nEpstein \nspending \ntime \nalone \nwith \na \nminor \nvictim. \nb. \nHaving \ndeveloped \na \nrapport \nwith \na \nvictim, \nMAXWELL \nwould \ntry \nto \nnormalize \nsexual \nabuse \nfor \na \nminor \nvictim \nby, \namong \nother \nthings, \ndiscussing \nsexual \ntopics, \nundressing \nin \nfront \nof \nthe \nvictim, \nbeing \npresent \nwhen \na \nminor \nvictim \nwas \nundressed, \nand/or \nbeing \npresent \nfor \nsex \nacts \ninvolving \nthe \nminor \nvictim \nand \nEpstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL'S \npresence \nduring \nminor \nvictims' \ninteractions \nwith \nEpstein, \nincluding \ninteractions \nwhere \nthe \nminor \nvictim \nwas \nundressed \nor \nthat \ninvolved \nsex \nacts \nwith \nEpstein, \nhelped \nput \nthe \nvictims \nat \nease \nbecause \nan \nadult \nwoman \nwas \npresent. \nFor \nexample, \nin \nsome \ninstances, \nMAXWELL \nwould \n3 \nEFTA00010995\n\nmassage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other \ninstances, \nMAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized massages during which a minor victim would \nbe fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in \nEpstein sexually abusing the minor victims. \nd. In addition, Epstein offered to \nhelp some \nminor victims by paying for travel and/or educational \nopportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept \nEpstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel \nindebted and believed that \nMAXWELL and Epstein were trying to \nhelp them. \ne. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed victims to \nengage in sexual activity with Epstein. In \nsome instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the \nsexual abuse of minor victims. Some such \nincidents occurred in \nthe context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. \n5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a \nsexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to \nengage in sexual activity with those \nvictims. Epstein's \nresulting abuse of minor victims included, among other \nthings, \ntouching a victim's breast, touching a victim's \ngenitals, \nplacing a sex toy such as a vibrator on \na victim's genitals, \n4 \nEFTA00010996\n\ndirecting a victim \nto touch \nEpstein while he \nmasturbated, \nand \ndirecting a \nvictim to \ntouch Epstein's \ngenitals. \nMAXWELL AND \nEPSTEIN'S \nVICTIMS \n6. \nBetween approximately \nin or about \n1994 and in or \nabout 1997, \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nthe defendant, \nfacilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's \naccess to \nminor victims \nby, among other \nthings, inducing and \nenticing, and \naiding and abetting \nthe \ninducement and \nenticement of, multiple \nminor victims. \nVictims \nwere groomed \nand/or abused \nat multiple \nlocations, \nincluding the \nfollowing: \na.
