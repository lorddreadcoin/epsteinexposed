I'm a reporter with The Daily Beast and have been covering Jeffrey Epstein. \nToday, attorneys for Mr. Epstein's victims said Mr. Epstein sexually abused a young woman while he was out on work \nrelease in 2008-09. \nHere is our story. Would love to get your insight: haps://www.thedailybeast com effrey-epstein-abused-victims-while-\nserving-time-in-florida-lawyer-brad-edwards-says\nWould you be able to comment on this? Did SDNY hear any complaints about Mr. Epstein's activities while on work \nrelease? Could this perhaps factor into the case—especially as Mr. Epstein's legal team is trying to get him out on bail? \nAlternately, could you provide any comment on background? \nPlease drop me a line or give me a call. My cell is \nThanks so much! \nSenior \nJoin Beast Inside  our new membership program, to get more of the journalism you trust and love. \nEFTA00014477",
