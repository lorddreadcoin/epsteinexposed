I made a few small changes (which I highlighted since we've got a fair bit of track already) which \nI think should make this broad enough to cover the Trust II stuff. Can you take a quick look and if everyone is okay with \nthis, perhaps we can plan to get this to CM on Monday morning?

But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it \ndoesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents —  that may be because they're not referenced in any \nwill? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless \nsomebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a  2019 Trust but I don't see any documents \non that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with and/or tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore \nit if I've misread. \nthanks, \nFrom: (USANYS):,\nSent: Thursday, January 30, 2020 12:05 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein Sharing Order Part II \n(USANYS) \nJust wanted to circle back on this —M, are you signed off?

If so, I'll just add it to every mention of each document, but if not then it's \nunnecessary.

Would you take a look when you can? \n- I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. \nWould you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized \nthe new stuff we're looking to share? \nThanks, \nEFTA00018081",
