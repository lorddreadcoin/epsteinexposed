There was no \nbreach. The address provided was a very secure line, however, it was \nalready one being used. We are creating a line as secure as possible. \nWe are hoping for this to be complete by the 9:30 scheduled call, but I \ncannot confirm it will be ready by then. \nI sincerely apologize for the confusion and inconvenience. \nBest, \n>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM \n<bcsternheim@mac.com> \n8/12/2021 11:29 AM >>> \nGood \nmorning-\nIn my email of 8/9 (see below), I raised concerns regarding use of the \nMDC \nZoom \nplatform because it does not preclude third parties with access \ninformation to the Zoom \"Courtrooms\" \nfrom interfering (inadvertently or intentionally) with Ms. Maxwell's \nprivileged communication. \nThat concern manifested itself today when third parties accessed the \nZoom room used by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. \nThis breach was reported to, and I believe witnessed by, MDC staff, \nincluding technician \nThis severely impacts confidential privileged attorney-client \ncommunication and is especially concerning in this \nhigh-profile case. \nI am requesting that we immediately revert back to the WebEx platform \ncontrolled by Cohen & Gresser. \nPlease contact me to discuss. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nPlease note my new office address and preferred email address: \nBOBBI C.
