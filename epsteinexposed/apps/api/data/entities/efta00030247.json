Berman \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States \nCourthouse \nJuly 12, 2019 \nRe: United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear Judge Berman: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for \nPretrial Release (the \"Release Motion\"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its \nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the \"Detention Memo\"), submitted to Magistrate Judge \nPitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). \nSimply put, the Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant law, belittles \nand smears the many dozens of victims of the defendant's appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails \nto meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will \nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. \nRather than even attempting to address the grave risks of releasing a defendant with extraordinary \nfinancial resources, the defendant instead proposes a bail package that is effectively an unsecured \nbond masquerading as a  14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and \norder him detained pending trial. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for \nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment against him setting forth allegations that he abused \ndozens of minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in multiple states. To this day, he is \ndesignated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, despite his attempts to \nlower that classification. And any doubt that he is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated \nwhen law enforcement agents discovered a trove of nude images of young girls in his Manhattan \nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime \ninvolving a juvenile. \nThe defendant faces substantial evidence of guilt founded on the corroborated testimony \nof numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will be go to prison for \nthe rest of his natural life. He has at his disposal a  vast fortune, nearly all of which remains \nEFTA00030247\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 2 \nconcealed or obscured from the Court and the Government. The defendant also has a history of \nobstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including as recently as when his offenses reemerged \nin the media mere months ago. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the \ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and \ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments. \nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and fast-growing—evidence, serious charges, and \nthe prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions that \nare preposterously inadequate. While there are no conditions of bail that would reasonably assure \nthe defendant's presence in court proceedings or protect the safety of the community, as further \nexplained below, the defendant's proposal here is not a  serious one. The defendant's Release \nMotion sets forth a woefully inadequate bail package that, among other things, offers to pledge as \nthe only security against at least hundreds of millions of net worth a single property that has already \nbeen designated by the Government for forfeiture and is therefore of no value whatsoever as \ncollateral. His proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable \nwould be little comfort to victims forced to wait additional months or years while the defendant is \nlocated and returned to this country. The promise to \"deregister or otherwise ground\" his private \njet is meaningless given his wealth and ability to secure other means of travel, and the two \nco-signers he proposes only reinforce his minimal community ties. Electronic monitoring would \nmerely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing. And the private security force he proposes \nto guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar circumstances, simply \nreinforced the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he can be secured at all \ntimes: a federal correction center. \nThe defendant faces a  presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended \ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. The Court should order him detained. \nBACKGROUND \nA. Overview and Offense Conduct \nAs previously set forth, a  federal grand July in this District returned an indictment (the \n\"Indictment\") charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, \nand conspiracy to commit the same. The defendant argues that the Government \"labels this a `Sex \nTrafficking' case,\" as if the Government invented the term just for this defendant. Release Motion \nat 2. In fact, the title of the statute for which a grand jury has found probable cause to believe the \ndefendant violated is: \"Sex Trafficking of Children.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1591. \nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those charges involve a years-long \nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens \nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in \ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide \"massages\" to the \ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual \nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect \ncontact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant \nEFTA00030248\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 3 \nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He \npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, \ncreating a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach. \nThe defendant keeps making clear the he does not understand the gravity of the offenses \nwith which he is charged, including his claim that he has \"no criminal history\"—other than a \nconviction for engaging in sexual conduct with a minor, precisely the same kind of conduct alleged \nhere. And following that conviction, as described previously by the Government, the defendant \ncontinued to maintain a vast trove of hundreds or thousands of nude photos of young subjects. The \ndefendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young as 14 years old \nwhen he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including because victims told \nhim directly they were underage. And he abused these victims repeatedly—day after day, month \nafter month, year after year. \nThe defense calls these appalling acts \"simple prostitution.\"' Mag. Tr. 12:12; see also \nD. Tr. at 6:15-19 (\"This is basically the Feds today . .  .  redoing the same conduct that was \ninvestigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking\"). That \noffensive and horrible labeling of underage girls as prostitutes is unrecognized in federal law, \nwhich criminalizes commercial sex acts with minors irrespective of the presence or absence of \nforce, fraud, or coercion. Defense counsel has already argued repeatedly that the Government's \ncase is infirm because no threats or coercion is alleged. Mag. Tr. at 12 (\"There was no coercion. \nThere were no threats. There was no violence.\"), 17 (\"there was no coercion. \nThere was no \nintimidation. There is no deception.\"); Release Motion at 2 (\"There are no allegations ... that he \nforced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody ....\"). \nThe most charitable explanation of this argument is that defense counsel may not yet realize \nwith which offense the defendant has been charged, wrongly believing it to be the provision of the \nrelevant statute that criminalizes recruitment or enticement of adults for commercial sex through \nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. The prong under which the defendant is \ncharged, conversely, involves minors. As the indictment properly alleges, and the statute provides \nfor, where victims are underage, the Government principally must prove that a minor is caused to \nengage in a  commercial sex act. See United States v. Afrare, 632 F. App'x 272, 278 (6th Cir. \n2016) (\"We hold that § 1591(a) criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) \nwith or without any force, fraud, or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults \n(18 or older), but only if done by force, fraud, or \ncoercion.\"). \nHere, incredibly, the defense has already effectively admitted that the Government will be \nable to present evidence of these primary elements—that the defendant engaged in sex acts for \nmoney with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion at 2. If the defendant dislikes the \nstate of federal sex trafficking law, he may petition any of the nine members of Congress who \n\"Mag. Tr.\" refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019; \n\"D. Tr.\" refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2019. \nEFTA00030249\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 4 \nrepresent his places of residence; meanwhile, in the case that has actually been brought, his \ninsistence that he is innocent of a crime with which he is not charged is irrelevant. \nB. The Defendant \nIt might not occur to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant is widely reported \nto be a billionaire—indeed, even the word \"million\" only appears once, to offer up as collateral a \nproperty the Government has already noticed for seizure and forfeiture. Release Motion at 4. \nOtherwise, there is not a single mention of net worth, income, or valuation of the defendant's vast \nassets. This is, at best, obscurative. \nPut plainly, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy. According to records from a financial \ninstitution (\"Institution-1\") relating to the defendant, in or about 2017, the defendant's estimated \nnet worth was listed as \"$500 MM +\" and his estimated annual income was $10 million. According \nto records from another financial institution (\"Institution-2\") relating to the defendant, from 2018 \nthrough the present, the defendant's personal and business accounts have spent more than $10 \nmillion on credit cards alone. \nThe defendant has six residences, a private jet, an estimated net worth of at least a half a \nbillion dollars. His extraordinary incentives to flee, as further discussed below, are equaled by his \nmeans to do so. \nARGUMENT \nThe Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be detained \npending trial. He is a  tremendous risk of flight, and a danger to the community, and he cannot \novercome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. \nI. The Defendant's Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk \nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances \nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do nothing \nwhatsoever to mitigate that risk. \nA. The Defendant's Financial Resources \nAs set forth in the Government's Detention Memo, the nature and circumstances of this \noffense and the strength of the evidence create an extraordinary risk of flight. The defendant faces \nup to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which he is charged, and the possibility \nof a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. \nJackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987). \nAnd the evidence of his guilt, already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was \nunsealed, is growing stronger literally by the day. Several additional women have identified \nthemselves to the Government as victims of the defendant. Pursuant to judicially-authorized \nEFTA00030250\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 5 \nsearch warrants, the Government has discovered and seized vast amounts of photographs of nude \nand seminude young women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process \nof reviewing dozens of electronic discs that contain still more such photos. And dozens of \nindividuals have called the Government to convey information regarding the defendant and his \nconduct. All this in less than a  week, and all in addition to an Indictment that already alleges \ndozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. \nFaced with significant and mounting evidence, the defendant's Release Motion does not \neven attempt to account for the numerous entities, accounts, and assets he controls in the United \nStates and abroad. The Court cannot begin to evaluate the defendant's net worth, much less be \naware of particular obscured, hidden, or foreign-based assets that would further demonstrate the \ndefendant's ability to finance a comfortable life beyond the reach of United States authorities. The \ndefendant's financial resources are indisputably a relevant aspect of his \"history and \ncharacteristics.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(3); See United States v.  Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 795 (1st \nCir. 1991) (explaining that a district court should consider the extent of a defendant's assets and \nnet worth before determining the amount of property to be posted as forfeiture condition). \nIn the first instance, because the defendant has refused to fill out a  financial affidavit in \nconnection with his application for bail, the Court simply does not have sufficient information to \nproperly and accurately evaluate the defendant's risk of flight. Although the defendant continues \nto hide the true scope, nature, and amount of his assets, he has repeatedly been described as a \nbillionaire in press reports, and is identified in documents of his own financial institution as having \na net worth of $500 million or more. \nAs described in the Government's Detention Memo, these resources, which remain \nunknown in scope and would be completely unfettered by the defendant's proposed bail package, \ngive the defendant access to innumerable means to flee. The defendant is a frequent traveler and \nregularly travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in \nwhich he traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018. Extensive international travel of this \nnature further demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 \nF. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). \nAnd not only does the defendant have the means to flee thanks to his vast wealth, crucially, \neven were he to sacrifice literally all of his current assets, there is every indication that he would \nimmediately be able to resume making millions or tens of millions of dollars per year outside of \nthe United States. He already earns an estimated $10,000,000 per year, according to records from \nInstitution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in \npart in Paris, France; there would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his \nunknown assets abroad, and resuming whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a \ncomputer terminal beyond the reach of extradition. \nThe defendant is in a position to abandon millions of dollars in cash and property securing \nany potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of his life. These resources, and the ease \nwith which the defendant could flee and live outside the reach of law enforcement make the risk \nof flight unacceptably high. \nEFTA00030251\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 6 \nB. The Defendant's Promise of \"Consent\" to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical \nThe theoretical possibility of extradition does not support release, because extradition is \nnever guaranteed, and rather is typically lengthy, complicated, and expensive. Additionally, the \ndefendant's offer to sign a so-called \"consent\" to extradition provides no additional reassurance \nwhatsoever. Numerous courts have recognized that such purported waivers are unenforceable and \neffectively meaningless. See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, \nat *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, \nNo. \n15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at \n*3 (D. Or. Aug. 3, 2015); United States v.  Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, \nat *7 (D. Utah Aug. 27, 2013); United States v.  Cohen, \nNo. \nC 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 \nn. I I  (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v.  Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. \n2004); United States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); \nUnited States v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985). This is for very good reason: \nAny defendant who signs such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity \nand/or voluntariness of the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the \none to which he chose to flee). The Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs is \nunaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an anticipatory extradition \nwaiver binding. \nC. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance \nThe defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the \nCourt. In particular, the defendant's endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio \nfrequency bracelet is farcical—neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed. At \nbest, home confinement and electronic monitoring would merely reduce his head start should he \ndecide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, \nNo. \n00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. \nAug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because home \ndetention with electronic monitoring \"at best \n... \nlimits a fleeing defendant's head start\"); see also \nUnited States v.  Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); \nUnited States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, \nNo. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). \nD. Private Security is Inadequate and Raises Numerous Questions and Challenges \nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from \ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected. \nAt the outset, it is far from clear that the defendant's private jail proposal, which seeks to \nreplicate the conditions of a  government-run detention facility in the defendant's home, is a \ncondition of \"release\" that implicates the Bail Reform Act. \"[T]here is a  debate within the \njudiciary over whether a defendant, if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own \nhome at her own cost, has a  right to do so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States \nConstitution.\" United States v. Valerio, 9  F. Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) \n(collecting cases). \nThe Second Circuit has never directly addressed this issue. See United States \nv. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"The government has not argued and, therefore, \nEFTA00030252\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 7 \nwe have no occasion to consider whether it would be `contrary to the principles of detention and \nrelease on bail' to allow wealthy defendants `to buy their way out by constructing a private jail.\" \n(citations omitted)). While \"troubled by [the] possibility\" of wealthy defendants being allowed to \nconstruct a  private jail, the Second Circuit has not yet had occasion to decide whether district \ncourts \"routinely must consider the retention of self-paid private security guards as an acceptable \ncondition of release before ordering detention.\" United States v. Banki, 369 Fed. App'x 152, \n153-54 (2d Cir. 2010) (unpublished); see Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (noting that the Bail \nReform Act addresses solely \"conditions of release, not conditions of detention\"). Indeed, a \ndecision by this Court reasoned that \"the very severe restrictions\" in the private jail proposal \npresented to him did \"not appear to contemplate `release' so much as it describes a very expensive \nform of private jail or detention.\" United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. \nJune 16, 2016). \nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant's which, \"at \nbest `elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a  facility \ninstills.\"' United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, \n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. \nSupp. 3d at 295 (\"The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use \nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether \nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the \nimperfections-of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more \nsecure option of an actual jail.\"). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled \nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner \ncan be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant's proposed \nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving \narmed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the \ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the \ndefendant's flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. \n2019) (in rejecting a private jail proposal, noting that it \"raise[d] several issues related to use of \nforce\" including that any escape attempt would \"present the risk of a confrontation of armed guards \nand Defendant . . . in the streets of New York city, which would mean that any reduction in the \nDefendant's flight risk from this proposal would be at least partially offset by a greater risk to the \ncommunity\") (citation omitted). \"This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal \nprisoners should be detained in facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional \nfacilities.\" Id. at 258 (citing Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 74 n.13 (\"To the extent [armed private guards] \nimplies an expectation that deadly force may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at \ntrial... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, demand a defendant's detention\")). \nIn Banki, the Second Circuit has held that it is not legal error \"for a district court to decline \nto accept,\" as \"a substitute for detention,\" a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor \nhim. 369 F. App'x at 154. In the same decision, the Second Circuit noted that it was \"troubled\" \nby the possibility of \"allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy their way out by constructing a private \njail.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accord, e.g., United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 \nEFTA00030253\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 12, 2019 \nPage 8 \n(WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) (\"It is contrary to underlying \nprinciples of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should \nbe able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained \nor ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully selected'\" (quoting Borodin v. \nAshcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. \n2014) (\"There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would suggest that a  defendant (or even, \nhypothetically, a group of defendants with private finding) has a statutory right to replicate or \nconstruct a private jail in a home or some other location.\"). \nThe defendant's payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having \nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding \nhim, leaving the company's incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani, \n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the \nappearance of a defendant, noting a \"clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an \ninmate\" and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant \n\"was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was vitited by a masseuse for a \ntotal of 160 hours in a  30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a  restaurant in \nChinatown with his private guards in tow\"); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 \nWL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (Finding Zarrab \"particularly instructive\" and \nfurther noting: \"While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the \ndefendant's security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in \nfleeing the Court's jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential \nto corrupt or undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's \nruling, they also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.\"). \nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that \"the Defendant's privately funded armed guard \nproposal is unreasonable because it  helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a \nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.\" 2016 \nWL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (\"although this Defendant has vast \nfinancial resources to construct his own 'private prison,' the Court is not convinced 'disparate \ntreatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act\"') (quoting United States v. \nBruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (\"Even if Defendant had the financial capacity \nto replicate a  private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of \nconditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, \nor that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.\")); Borodin, \n136 F.

(\"It is contrary to underlying principles of \ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy \ntheir way out by constructing a  private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately \naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.\"). \nThe defendant's appearance can only be assured through detention— not through bail \ngranted based on hollow promises of an intent to clear his name in the face of weighty evidence \nand a sentence of up to 45 years in jail, not through release on the threat of forfeiture of a  mere \nfraction of his wealth and property should he flee, and not through \"detention\" under the guard of \nindividuals to be paid by the defendant himself.
