I told her to submit a FOIA request and to let us know when she had done so, and \nwe'd make sure the BOP received it. told me that he would make sure BOP responds in a timely \nfashion. \nOCME was similarly very appreciative of the head's up. is making the production this afternoon. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 2021 2:04 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Notice to Epstein Family \nSound right to me. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 2021 1:38 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) ‹> \nSubject: Notice to Epstein Family \n(USANYS) \nC \n(USANYS)\nI spoke with the GC of OCME and she was very appreciative of the head's up. She asked whether we intended to provide \nnotice to the family about the autopsy report's release, which is something they would normally do. As we discussed, \nwe have not provided a head's up to the Estate given that they are on notice of the FOIA litigation. As you may recall, \nthough, we met with Epstein's brother in the course of our investigation, and he is represented by Stacey Richman. \nAfter giving it some thought, I don't see much of a downside to giving Stacey a call on Friday to give her a head's up \nabout the production of the autopsy report, which seems to be the human thing to do. Do you guys have any \nobjection? \nThanks, \nEFTA00027460\n\nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nDesk \nCell \nEFTA00027461",
