    "text": "\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nUnited States of America, \n—v—\nGhislaine Maxwell, \nDefendant. \nUSDC SDNY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY PILED \nDOC N: \nDATE FILED: 7/7/2020 \n20-CR-330 (MN) \nORDER \nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: \nAn arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter is hereby scheduled to \noccur as a remote video/teleconference using an intemet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In \nadvance of the conference, Chambers will email counsel with further information on how to \naccess the video conference. \nTo optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, \nand counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access \nthe audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the intemet \nplatform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of \nthe press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, \nwhich the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. \nGiven the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote \nproceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing \nrequirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons \nwill be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears \nat any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to \nEFTA00024443\n\narriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive \nat the courthouse. Please see the instructions, attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of \ntime will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements \nestablished by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be \nallowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at \nall times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been adopted by \nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. \nAs discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the \nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the proceeding. \nSee Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form (either personally or, in \naccordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of March 27, 2020, by defense counsel), defense \ncounsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the \nDefendant consents, but counsel is unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the \nform, the Court will conduct an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is \nappropriate for the Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. \nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government must \"make their best efforts to see \nthat crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights\" provided to them in that section. \nThis includes \"Nile right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court \nproceeding ... involving the crime or of any release ... of the accused\" and \"[t]he right to be \nreasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § \n3771(a)(2), (4). The Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So \nthat appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by \nEFTA00024444\n\nemail within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on \nthe question of detention pending trial. \nFinally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the \nSpeedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. \nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act \nfrom today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote \nproceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best \ninterest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The \nexclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, \nwhich will facilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of \nthird parties. See Dkt. No. 5. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: July 7, 2020 \nNew York, New York \nALISON J. NATHAN \nUnited States District Judge \nEFTA00024445\n\nAll members of the public, including attorneys, appearing at a Southern District of New York \ncourthouse must complete a questionnaire and have their temperature taken before being allowed \nentry into that courthouse. \nOn the day you are due to arrive at the courthouse, click on the following weblink, or scan the \nfollowing QR code with a mobile device camera to begin the enrollment process.
