They're pretty hands on when it comes to et al, but nothing like you're \ndescribing (of= has seemingly experienced with AMI). \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, April 9, 2020 10:12 AM \nTo: \nSubject: out of curiosity \nTo the extent anybody in this small group is willing to share, are any of you folks' teams / cases getting significant pressure \nfrom the chiefs on memos or other written product this week, whether for the brass or otherwise? I'm just curious \nwhether it's just the Epstein case (where we're getting near-daily prodding about imminent deadlines for memos that are \nboth extremely time-intensive and also couldn't possibly be acted upon for weeks, given the circumstances of the world) \nor if it's something broader in the unit. I just sent the chiefs a pretty crabby email about being bugged daily about lengthy, \ndetailed work product and it made me wonder whether this is a trend or an isolated incident. \nMore importantly, hope y'all and families are all staying healthy . . . \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00015282",
