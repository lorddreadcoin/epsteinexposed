Proposed addition below. \nTo my knowledge, that is the only excel spreadsheet in our possession that indexes physical evidence related to this case, \nbut this is not a  comprehensive document. The discovery productions also included search warrant returns listing the \nphysical items seized by the FBI's New York Office during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and \nthe U.S Virgin Islands, but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. \nAs a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the \nphysical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to complete such an index. \nBest, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, March 9, 2021 3:57 PM \nTo:I\nSubject: FW: US v.

Also \nincluded in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found \nwithin Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007.
