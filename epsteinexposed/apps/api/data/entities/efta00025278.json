It did not have postage. If, for some questionable reason, it had been \nhandled by the U.S . Postal Service \n(which is highly unlikely and, if so, deliberately caused by the MDC), the Post Office would have returned it to my office \naddress (at the return address on the envelope), \nnot deliver it to the MDC without postage. \nThis suggests some type of foul play on the part of the MDC, or at least some type of cover-up. \nI am informed that the Warden is aware of this. Today, I received the envelope from Unit Manager \nToday, Christian Everdell, Esq. and I had a scheduled legal visit with Ms. Maxwell. \nRather than permitting us to use a somewhat larger room, we were required to use a room for two. \nThis completely defeated the purpose of COVID protective measures. The plastic partition did not shield \nMr. Everdell and there was little or no table surface for him to use. The room was unnecessarily cramped \nwhen a larger room was available. My request to use a larger room was denied. The officer claimed the team could not \nposition the camera \nto focus on the larger room. This response was bogus. I requested to see the Warden, but that request was never \nhonored. \nFurther, defense counsel at large have heard about the current electricity issues affecting water, toilet flushing, and meals. \nMs. Maxwell received a bologna sandwich despite being on no-flesh (vegetarian) diet. \nThis is yet another blunder on the part of the MDC which needs to be immediately corrected. \nI will not waste my energy requesting a response because even if forthcoming it will likely be insufficient. \nThese matters will be brought to the Court's attention, so you can start preparing excuses for consideration by Judge \nNathan. \nEnjoy your holiday. \nBobbi \nEFTA00025278\n\nBOBBI C.

On that same day, \nin that same mailbox, \nI deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building. That \nclient confirmed that he received his legal mail. \nMs. Maxwell has not. \nPlease explain why delivery of Ms. Maxwell's mail has been delayed. \nTime is of the essence. Her trial begins on November 29th. \nEvery delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare \nfor trial. \nYour prompt response is requested. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
