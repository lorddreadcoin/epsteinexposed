The remedy should have a \nhttps://www.law360.corniarticles/1172511/gov-t-says-\nepstein-victims-can-t-scrap-nonprosecution-deal \nEFTA00030231\n\nnexus to \nthe purpose of the CVRA, which is to give \nvictims a voice but not to give them decision-making \nauthority over prosecutors, according to the \ngovernment. \n\"The past cannot be undone; the government \ncommitted itself to the terms of the [nonprosecution \nagreement], and the parties have not disputed that \nEpstein complied with its provisions,\" the \ngovernment said. \"A number of Epstein's victims \nsubsequently invoked the NPA to enter into civil \nsettlements with Epstein and, in that respect, also \nrelied on its terms. Any remedy for the CVRA \nviolation should thus serve to give the victims a \nvoice, even though the prosecution decision remains \nout of their hands.\" \nThe government instead proposed a meeting with the \ntwo plaintiffs, as well as any other Epstein victims \nwho want to attend, at which a U.S. Department of \nJustice representative will discuss the government's \nreasoning in resolving the Epstein case. \nThe government said prosecutors would also \nparticipate in a public court proceeding at which any \nEpstein victims can make statements. In addition, all \ncriminal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for \nthe Southern District of Florida would undergo \nadditional training on the CVRA and victim \nassistance \nissues. \n\"While the court cannot unwind the past, the \nremedies proposed by the government would give the \nvictims a meaningful opportunity to have their voices \nheard and to understand, if not accept the decisions \nmade in this matter,\" the government said. \n\"Petitioners' requested remedies, on the other hand, \nrun afoul of the remedial scheme contemplated by the \nEFTA00030232\n\nCVRA, are contrary to law, and may cause \nunintended harm to the victims whose interests are \nalso protected by the CVRA.\" \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted \nsummary judgment in February to the two victims, \nlisted as Jane Does, who sued the government in \n2008 alleging that prosecutors had violated the \nCVRA with the Epstein deal. The judge said the \ngovernment's decision to hide its intentions and to \ntell victims to just be patient with the investigation \nwas \"particularly problematic.\" \nJudge Marra rejected the government's claim that the \nCVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea \nbargain or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of \nwhich are more common than a nonprosecution \nagreement. That reading of the law is \"inconsistent \nwith the goal of the CVRA,\" according to the judge. \n\"The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to \nonly one interpretation; namely, that victims should \nbe notified of significant events resulting in \nresolution of their case without a trial,\" Judge Marra \nsaid. \nThe CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, \nincluding the right to be informed of public court \nproceedings and not to be excluded from those \nproceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative \nreport published late last year, printed emails \nshowing the alleged victims were deliberately \nexcluded from the deal cut between Acosta, who was \nthen the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of \nFlorida, and Epstein's defense \nteam. \nBrad Edwards, who represents the victims, said his \nclients are disappointed by the government's \nEFTA00030233\n\nresponse. \n\"After sifting through self-serving statistics and \nvariations of the same excuses we have heard for \nyears, the government took no responsibility for its \nclear wrongdoing and suggests that no remedy is the \nappropriate ruling,\" Edwards said. \"In fact, it acts \nlike it is doing the victims a favor by offering to have \nits attorneys voluntarily attend training courses. The \npleading was the type of slap in the face that we \nexpect to \nsee from Mr. Epstein.\" \nEpstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens \n— claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, \nFlorida, mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have \nnot had the opportunity to testify in court in any \nproceeding thus far, according to the Herald report. \nEpstein pled guilty in 2008 to state charges involving \nsolicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors \nfor prostitution. He spent 13 months in prison and is \nregistered as a sex offender. \nThe victims are represented by Bradley Edwards \nof Edwards Pottinger LLC, Jay C. Howell of Jay \nHowell & Associates PA, John Scarola of Searcy \nDenney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley PA, and Paul G. \nCassell of the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney \nCollege of Law. \nThe government is represented by Byung J. Pak, Jill \nE. Steinberg and Nathan P. Kitchens of the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Northern District of \nGeorgia. \nThe \ncase is Doe v. U.S., case number 9:08-cv-80736, \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida. \nEFTA00030234\n\n--Editing by Kelly Duncan. \nEFTA00030235",
