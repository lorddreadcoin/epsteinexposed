We wanted to \nreach out because we served a subpoena on Amazon on June 12, and we'd like to ask to expedite the response, at least as \nto shipping /  delivery information for the relevant individual. The subpoena is attached for your reference, and it would \nbe extraordinarily helpful if we could get at least that information by the end of the week (which is the deadline on the \nsubpoena, though obviously we ordinarily are understanding of some additional time being necessary). Please let us \nknow? And we're happy to discuss if that would be useful. \nthanks, \nIMF \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 14:44 \nTo: \nSubject: Automatic reply: Subpoena CRIM1031692 \nI'm traveling for business today (8/15) so my responses might be delayed. If your inquiry involves a law enforcement \ninformation request, please contactil ( ), and/or \n). \nEFTA00017701",
