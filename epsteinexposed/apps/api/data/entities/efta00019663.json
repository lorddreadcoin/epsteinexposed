In addition, PII should \nnot be sent to or from personal email addresses at any time (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, Comcast, Yahoo). \nTo compose a secure message open Microsoft Outlook email application and compose the message as normal. \nWhen ready to send - select the \"Send Securely\" button. Alternately, if you are using another email client (OWA, \niOS, \nBlackberry etc.) enter the word [encrypt] into the Subject field of the message. Include the square brackets \nfollowed by any other pertinent Subject information, and send the message as you normally would. The \nProofpoint email encryption service will detect and encrypt the message prior to delivery. The external recipient \nwill be notified via email, how to retrieve the encrypted message. \nIf you did not intend to send NI within the message, please check the message contents and resend the message \nwithout the PII. \nMessage \nDetails: \nFrom: \nTo: \nDate : 2019-08-16 17:13:46 GMT \nSubject: RE: Subpoenas Re \nFor any questions, please contact your local IT Helpdesk. \nEFTA00019663",
