And of course she should feel free to calm us if she needs any assistance with \ndirections or transportation. \nThanks, \nOn Feb 25, 2020, at 09:03, \nHello= \n> wrote: \nI  spoke to and she and I can meet with you on Wednesday, March 4th at 2:00 p.m. Please confirm that works \nfor your team.

As discussed, we wanted to follow up with you \nvia email about a possible meeting with Ms. —it sounded like it might be convenient to do a meeting next \nweek while you're in New York, if that would work for her? If so, if you could give us the dates and time ranges that \nmight be possible, we can coordinate on scheduling on our end as well. And of course as always we're happy to address \nany questions that you or she might have in advance. \nthanks very much, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThe information contained in this electronic message is confidential information intended only for the use of the named recipient(s) and may contain information \nthat, among other protections. is the subject of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.
