The good news is that they're getting this back to us on a rolling basis, and it looks \nlike we'll have at least some of this stuff in time to produce it by 11/9. The bad news is it does not seem like we'll have all \nof it by that date. It does seem like we'll have greater clarity by early next week. \nI confess, I don't feel like I fully understand all of the steps in this process or why it takes as long as it does, but I'm happy \nto go back to. with additional questions if that would be helpful. I'm also happy to ask that he set up a call with us and \nPAE if that would be helpful. Please let us know what we can do. \nFrom: (USANYS) <E> \nSent: Friday, October 30, 2020 12:51 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: FW: Phone Call Follow-Up \n(USANYS) \nSome of the data is being sent to use today by FedEX. However, there is a  ton of stuff still being processed. That stuff is \nstill being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to He thinks it is not possible to \nmeet the November 9 date. He thinks the next step might be done on Tuesday, and then a better estimate of completion \nmight be possible. \n• \nFrom: Koontz, Nicholas [US] \nSent: Friday, October 30, 2020 12:25 PM \nTo: (USANYS)\nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n<\nSubject: Phone Call Follow\n-Up \nGood Afternoon \nU: \nFollowing up on our earlier phone conversation, a hard drive with the following productions is being sent to SONY via \nFedEx with the following productions in the US v.
