I  think we would do that if it were after business \nhours. The question is whether the same thing applies if she is arrested at 2 p.m. today. \nOn \nJul 1, 2020, at 9:11 AM, wrote: \nI just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a \nday or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday \nmorning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. \nThat said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early \ntomorrow morning. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 1, 2020 9:07 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: GM \nEven 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested \nduring \nbusiness hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow? \nOn Jul 1, 2020, at 9:03 AM, wrote: \nFYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. \nConsistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we \ndon't have her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be \npresented until tomorrow in any event. \nEFTA00029859",
