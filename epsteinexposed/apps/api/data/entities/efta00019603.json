Told him we could use another person and prefer M. He \nsaid he'll talk to and let us know, so that seems like a good sign. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, June 1, 2020 6:33 PM \nTo: (USANYS) <> \nSubject: RE: wbtw \nDefinitely has bandwidth, he has been telling me he is looking for work. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Monday, June 1, 2020 6:29 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: wbtw \nSounds good. Any sense of bandwidth? If he's not very busy, could use that to pitch him to the chiefs. \nFrom: \nann \nSent: Monday, June 1, 20206:18 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: \nwbtw \nHey-\nThat sounds good to me, thanks. I think it makes sense to discuss our theory of the case, both on the wbtw scheme and \non the possible PPE scam, just to make sure everyone is on the same page as we continue reviewing. In particular, now \nthat is openly taking a salary, we should discuss materiality—I don't think those issues are prohibitive at all, but it \nmight be helpful to make sure everyone is attuned to those issues as we review. \nIn terms of staffing, can we add M? I know he'd want to do it. Apologies that I haven't been working on this case since \nwe moved to remote work—I reviewed emails before we left the office, but haven't continued since then. In terms of \nbandwidth, Epstein/Rikers stuff has been taking up my time, although I'm hopeful that will relent a bit over the summer \n(or that someone up the chain will get tired of reading memos?). More immediately, I should be able to dig into email \nreview probably starting next weekish. Regardless, don't be shy about passing things off to me if you think of things we \nshould be doing that I'm not spotting. \nFrom: (USANYS) <> \nSent: Monday, June 1, 2020 5:01 PM \nTo: \nSubject: wbtw \nEFTA00019603\n\nhey - thought it made sense to check in before our call tomorrow. in terms of current status, i think we continue to review \nthe email returns, schedule the new financials and dig in on this covid scheme that is doing, and probably do \nanother warrant (either a refresh or some new accounts). is going to assign a GCer to do priv review, and I'm \ncontinuing to hassle I=. about the iCloud returns. What's your bandwidth like? I know you're probably busy with \nEpstein and Rikers stuff. We're getting close to doing a superseder in the Ukrainians case, but then I'm pretty free until my \ncurrently scheduled trial in September (which I bet gets moved, but who knows). I think it may make sense to add a third \nperson to assist with email review and pushing this closer to charging. There are some people in our unit who are slow, \nand/or GC is actually pretty slow except for compassionate release. On the other hand, fine to wait on this if you think we \nshould. Let me know. \nThanksl \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nTel: \nCell: \nEFTA00019604",
