Introduction \nThis chapter examines the means by which the UK assists and seeks the assistance of foreign A.7.01 \nstates+ in the investigation and prosecution of fraud and related offences.2 \nIn this chapter the term 'foreign state' includes the Channel Islands. the Isle of Man. and British Overseas \nTerritories, which are responsible themselves for providing mum] assistance in response to requests from \nocher countries. \n2   But note that the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (CICA) also permits the UK to provide \nassistance in relation CO administrative proceedings and demency proceedi ng,s in foreign states. There arc \nalso statutory powers enabling foreign states to seek assistance in relation to financial and regulatory \nmatters under the Companies Act 1989 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Part 1 of the \nRegulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 contains provisions relating to mutual assistance in the \ninterception of communications. There are also a range of provisions for the exchange of information in \ntax matters. see eg the European Administrative Cooperation (Taxation) Regulations 2012. SI 2012/ \n3062. \nThe two principal pieces of legislation+ in this field are: A.7.02 \n•  the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (CICA 2003). CICA \n2003 contains \nprovisions allowing the UK to seek and provide assistance in a number of ways, including \nthe provision of evidence and information; the service of process, the enforcement of \nforeign driving disqualifications, and other related matters? CICA 2003 repealed the \nCriminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 1990 however ss 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the \n1990 \nAct remain in force; \n•  the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (the POCA \nOrder); enables the UK to restrain assets at the request of foreign states and also to \nenforce external confiscation orders! \n1  The enforcement of foreign judgments in civil proceedings is outside the scope of this work. For a recent \nanalysis of the provisions concerning enforcement of foreign orders in insolvency proceedings. and the \nForeign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 and s 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986. see New \nCap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (in liquidation) v Grant 120121 Ch 538. CA. \n2   The provisions of CICA 2003 relating to service of process and driving disqualifications are not covered \nin this chapter. For further details. see C Nicholls, C Montgomery and IS Knowles. The Law of \nExtradition and Mutual Assistance (3rd edn, \n2013), \nchs 22 and 23. \n3   SI 2005/3181, Made under POCA. \n4  Part 3  of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas \nForfeiture Orders) Order 2005 (SI 2005/3180) contains similar powers enabling forfeiture of the \ninstrumentalities of crime at the request of foreign states, as to which see generally Malabu Oil and Gas \nLtd v Dimes, of -Public Prosecutions (20161 Lloyd's Rep FC 108. \n(a) Relationship between international agreements on mutual assistance \nand domestic legislation \nThe development of mutual assistance legislation in the UK has primarily been driven by A.7.03 \nmutual legal assistance treaties and other international agreements. These instruments had \nthe effect of requiring the UK to adapt its laws so as to enable it to honour its international \nobligations. It is thus convenient to consider these agreements first before describing the \ndomestic legislation. \nFraud A-7007 \nEFTA00022212\n\n[A.7.04] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nA.7.04 However, unlike in respect of extradition, it should be noted at the outset that the domestic \nmutual assistance scheme does not require the existence of a treaty as a pre-condition for the \ngranting of mutual assistance. The UK is able, in general, to offer assistance to any state \nwhether or not that country is able to reciprocally assist the UK, and whether or not there \nis a bilateral or multilateral agreement in place.' \n1  Mutual Legal Attittante Guidelines for the United Kingdom (12th edn. Home Office. March \n2015). p 5. \nA.7.05 Mutual legal assistance treaties therefore have a dual role to play in the mutual assistance \nprocess. First, they can be used as an aid to the interpretation of relevant legislation.' In \nparticular, parts of the CICA 2003 give effect to international agreements and framework \ndecisions, and these domestic provisions fall to be interpreted in light of the international \ninstrument to which they give effect.2 Secondly, the Secretary of State and the court must \ntake into account treaty provisions when considering the extent to which assistance should \nbe granted under the CICA 2003 or other legislation? \nArlan.

The \nUK has also ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime 2000 and the UN \nConvention Against Corruption 2003. \nA.7.07 There have also been a number of important developments at  EU level, including the \nSchengen Convention' the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters \nand its Protocol? and most recently the development of mutual recognition initiatives to \nfacilitate speedier mutual legal assistance. However, the referendum on the United \nA-7008 release 13/Jul 19 \nEFTA00022213\n\nA. \nIntroduction [A.7.11] \nKingdom's membership of the European Union, held on 23 June 2016, led to a decision to \nwithdraw from EU membership. Notice of intention to leave the EU ('Brexit) was served \nunder Art 50 TEL) on 29 March 2017. Withdrawal was due to take effect on 29 March \n2019 but at  the date of writing had been postponed. Consequently, the UK's continued \nparticipation in \nEU \nmutual recognition instruments remains the subject of significant \nuncertainty (see pan \nA.7.17).3\nOJ L 239. 22.09.2000, p 19. \n2   OJ C 197, 12.07.2000. p 3 and OJ C 326, 21.11.2001. \n3   See, eg. the House of Lords. European Union Committee. 'Brexit: Judicial Oversight of the European \nArrest Warrant', 6th Report of Session 2017-19. \nThe UK is also a signatory to a number of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties.' Among A.7.08 \nthese are the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US, which entered into force on \n12 February 1996. The Foreign Office maintains a list of all bilateral agreements.2\nI  Often referred to as an 'MIST'. \n2   See <http://www.fco.gov.ulden/publications-and-documents/treatieulists-treatiestbilateral-mutual-\nlegal>. \n(if European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters \nOne of the first international instruments to respond to the effects of cross-border criminal A.7.09 \nactivity was the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters) \nAlthough this opened for signature in 1959, it was not ratified by the UK until 1991 when \nthe Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 1990 came into force. Art 3(1) of the \nConvention provides that: \nThe requested Party shall execute in the manner provided for by its law any letters \nrogatory relating to a criminal matter and addressed to it by the judicial authorities of \nthe requesting Party for the purpose of procuring evidence or transmitting articles to \nbe produced in evidence, records or documents. \nETS No 30.

The Second Additional Protocol facilitates the exchange or disclosure of infor-\nmation by broadening the range of situations in which mutual assistance may be requested \nand by making the provision of assistance easier, quicker and more flexible. This includes \nthe creation of joint investigation teams (JIT),I \nI  Ankle 20. \nThe European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters was an important A.7.11 \nachievement for its time in its recognition of the necessity for specific instruments for \ncooperation in evidence gathering. However, like all new instruments, it had limitations. \nPerhaps the most notable was that the Convention was designed to operate amongst states \nof like legal tradition, namely the civil law states of Europe, and it was geared towards legal \nsystems where criminal prosecutions were under the control of an investigating judge. \nFraud A-7009 \nEFTA00022214\n\n(A.7.12) Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \n(ii) Commonwealth Scheme Relating to Mutual Assistance in Criminal \nMatters 1986 \nA.7.12 The Commonwealth Scheme was adopted by Commonwealth Law Ministers in Harare, \nZimbabwe, in August 19861 and has been amended since in 2002, 2005, and 2011.

The types of assistance envisaged by the Scheme include: \n•  obtaining and taking of evidence; \n•  making available records and other documents; \n•  facilitating the appearance of witnesses (including persons in custody) provided such \npersons consent; \n•  interception of telecommunications and postal items; \n•  covert electronic surveillance; \n•  the use of live video links in the course of investigations and judicial procedures; \n•  asset recovery; and \n•  issuing of process for compulsory measures including search and seizure. \n(iii) United Nations Convention against Corruption' \nA.7.14 The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 5814 of 31 October \n2003. \n1  See ehttplfwvomunodc.orgidocumentshreaties./UNCAOPublications./Conventiord08-50026_E. \npdf >. \nA.7.15 The principal aim of the Convention is  to prevent corruption from occurring. The \nConvention requires countries to establish criminal and other offences to cover a wide \nrange of acts of corruption, if these are not already crimes under domestic law. Chapter IV \nof the Convention deals with international cooperation consequent to that. Countries \nagreed to cooperate with one another in every aspect of the fight against corruption, \nincluding prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. Countries are bound \nby the Convention to render specific forms of mutual legal assistance in gathering and \ntransferring evidence for use in court, and to extradite offenders. Countries are also \nA-7010 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022215\n\nA. \nIntroduction [A.7.17] \nrequired to undertake measures which will support the tracing, freezing, seizure, and \nconfiscation of the proceeds of corruption.' \nI  See generally C Nicholls er 21. Comrption and Miswe of Public Office (3rd edn. 2017). \n(c) EU developments \nIn October 1999 at Tampere, the European Council adopted a legislative approach called A.7.16 \nmutual recognition as the cornerstone ofjudicial cooperation in the EU. This followed the \ninstitutional changes brought about by the Treaty of Amsterdam.' Mutual recognition \npresents a significant departure from existing mutual assistance procedures.2 The tradi-\ntional 'request principle' for mutual assistance entails requests being addressed from \nexecutive to executive through their national ministries. Such requests could be refused on \na wide variety of domestic discretionary principles including specialty,3 double criminal-\nity,\" the political offence exceptions and the bar on extraditing nationals.' However, this \nmade outcomes slow, cumbersome, and often unreliable. Mutual recognition has been \nembraced to change this by leaving decision-making predominantly with the judiciary. \nUnder mutual recognition, judicial decisions by one EU state can be implemented in \nanother with limited grounds for refusal and without any real consideration of the \nprocesses by which these decisions were reached.' This inevitably impacts on the individual \nby permitting their direct exposure to other European criminal justice systems. \nI  1997 \nOJ O340/1. \n2   See Madarel. 'Surrendering' the Fugitive—The European Arrest Warrant and the United Kingdom. \nJoCL \n71 (362) 2007. \n3   The specialty principle generally acts as a bar on an extradited person being prosecuted for anything \nother than the offence for which s/he was extradited. \n4  This is the principle that extradition or mutual assistance will be refused for acts that are not also defined \nas crimes in the jurisdiction dealing with the request. \n5  This exception is a general baron the extradition of alleged offenders who are sought for political activity \nand is aimed at preventing persecution. \n6  This bar has its basis in the link between allegiance and protection between state and its nationals, the \nright of a state to prosecute and punish its own nationals, and in a distrust of other criminal justice \nsystems. \n7   Peers. 'Mutual Recognition and Criminal Law Has the Council got it wrong?' CMLR 41:5-36 (2004). \np.10. \nThe mutual recognition agenda sought to revolutionise mutual legal assistance within the A.7.16A \nEU as legal instruments progressively replaced traditional mutual legal assistance conven-\ntions. To date there have been a  number of EU initiatives in the area of criminal mutual \nassistance that have had an important impact on the UK's domestic legislation, including \nCICA 2003. \nHowever, the legal situation has recently become complicated. Protocol 36 of the Treaty of A.7.17 \nLisbon permitted the UK Government to decide by 31 May 2014 whether it intended to \ncontinue to be bound by unamended, pre-Lisbon EU police and criminal justice (PCJ) \nmeasures. This allowed the UK to withdraw from these measures before they became \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Court ofJustice of the European Union and the European \nCommission's enforcement powers. Under Art 10(4) of Protocol 36, the UK indicated it \nFraud A-7011 \nEFTA00022216\n\n(A.7.18] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nwas withdrawing from all such measures with effect from 1 December 2014. It then set out \nits intention to opt back into 35 selected measures. The measures included many mutual \nrecognition instruments and a number of other key instruments (eg legislation establishing \nEuropol and Eurojust and legislation on joint investigation teams and criminal records). \nTwenty-nine measures, including Europol, Eurojust, and joint investigation teams were \neventually re-joined. For a while, therefore, normality was resumed.' However, the UK's \nsubsequent decision to withdraw from the EU leaves numerous issues pertaining to the \nfuture status of these instruments to be addressed within the exit negotiations.2 The UK \nGovernment has identified 'cooperating in the fight against crime and terrorism' as one of \nits twelve guiding principles in the 'Break negotiations? But there is no guarantee as yet \nthat an effective legal framework for mutual recognition of judgments can be maintained, \nthere being no precedents for many of the arrangements which need to be put in place. \nA significant potential stumblingblock is the role of the Court ofJustice of the EU (CJEU). \nAs taking `control of our own laws' was a core motivator behind the decision to leave the \nEU, any CJEU jurisdiction in relation to UK cooperation arrangements will remain highly \ncontentious.6 Possible alternative models of cooperation may potentially be found in the \nextradition agreement negotiated by Iceland and Norway with the EU.6 This requires \nthe parties to 'keep under review' the development of the case law of the CJEU and the \ndomestic courts of Iceland and Norway. Agreement on these issues is yet to be reached. \n1  The whole episode also served to resolve the legal problems identified in Autry v Sure/lib Prosecution \nAuthority [2012) 2 WLR 1275AC 471. pares 201-221: see above. n 9. \n2   For general discussion on these issues. see V Mitsilegas, 'European Criminal Law without the United \nKingdom?

With that caveat, we outline in s (i) below \nthe EU mutual legal assistance scheme in which the UK participates, as it currently stands. \n1  HM Government, 'Security, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice: A Future Partnership'. 18 Septem-\nber \n2017. \npan \n35. \n(I) The Schengen Convention+ \nFrance, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands agreed on 14 June 1985 to A.7.19 \nsign an agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders. This \nbecame known as  the Schengen Agreement, after the name of the town in Luxembourg \nwhere it was signed. \nI  See generally. D McClean. International Cooperation in Civil and Criminal Masters (2012), p 157. \nThe Convention Implementing the Schengen Convention was signed in June 1990 and A.7.20 \ncame into effect in March \n1995.' \nBy that time, other EU Member States had joined the \ninitial signatories of this inter-governmental agreement, which was signed outside the EU \nframework because of a lack of agreement in relation to competence in the areas of border \ncontrol. The Convention has 142 articles providing measures for creating a common area \nofjustice and security, following abolition of common borders. Its key aims are to facilitate \nfree movement within participating states; to improve police cooperation; to extend the \nprovision of mutual legal assistance between signatory states; and to improve access to the \nSchengen Information System (515). \n1 \n01 L 239. 22.09.2000, p 19. \nThe SIS was set up to allow police forces and consular agents from the Schengen countries A.7.21 \nto access data on specific individuals (ie criminals wanted for arrest or extradition, missing \npersons, third-country nationals to be refused entry, etc) and on goods which have been lost \nor stolen. The data related to persons may include data on: persons wanted for arrest for \nextradition purposes; aliens for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing \nentry; and missing persons or on persons needing temporary police protection, among \nother things. A second technical version of this system PS II) entered into operation on \n9 April 2013. It has enhanced functionalities, such as the possibility to use biometrics, new \ntypes of alerts, the possibility to link different alerts (such as an alert on a person and a \nvehicle) and a  facility for direct queries on the system. It also ensures stronger data \nprotection.' It is a database of 'real-time alerts about individuals and objects of interest to \nEU \nlaw enforcement agencies.2 Each participating country has a SIRENE (Supplementary \nInformation Request at the National Entry) Bureau, to provide supplementary informa-\ntion and coordinate activities. The UK connected to SIS II in April 2015.3At the time of \nwriting most information about persons of interest to law enforcement within the EU are \ndealt with by SIS II. The most likely replacement for the system when and if the UK leaves \nthe 515 is the Interpol system of notifications. \nFraud A-7013 \nEFTA00022218\n\n[A.7.22] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \n1  See the Council Decision of IS February 2008 on the trials for the second generation Schengen \nInformation System (SIS II) OJ L \n57, \n1.3.2008. \n2  House of Lords, European Union Committee.

There is no precedent for providing such access to a country which is neither \na Member State nor a Schengen country. Any future agreement on UK access will doubtless \nrequire the UK to continue to apply standards consistent with EU data protection \nlegislation. There is  equally no precedent on which the UK could rely to argue for \ncontinued access to SIS 11.1 \n1  See evidence of Security Commissioner Julian King to the House of Commons Home Affairs Commit-\ntee, 28 February 2017. according to  which outside of non-EU Schengen countries there are no \nprecedents for third countries accessing those information-sharing platforms (Q92). \n(ii) Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between EU Member \nStates and its Protocol \nOn 29 May 2000 the EU Council of Ministers adopted the Convention on Mutual A.7.26 \nAssistance in Criminal Matters.' The Convention did not enter force until 2005. Art 1 of \nthe Convention explains that its purpose is to supplement the provisions between Member \nStates of inter alia the the Council of Europe's 1959 Convention on Mutual Assistance in \nCriminal Matters and its Additional Protocol, and the mutual assistance provisions of the \nSchengen Convention. The EU Convention does not affect the application of more \nfavourable provisions in bilateral or multilateral agreements between Member States or \ncriminal mutual assistance arrangements agreed2 on the basis of uniform legislation or \nother special arrangements. \n1  OJ 197. 12.07.2000. p 3. See Explanatory Report on the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual \nAssistance in Criminal Matters between the Member SUMS of the European Union. OJ C  379. \n29.12.2000. p 7. \n2   As provided for in the Council of Europe's European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal \nMatters. Art 26(4). \nThus the EU Convention aims to encourage and modernise cooperation between judicial, A.7.27 \npolice, and customs authorities within the EU as well as  with Norway and Iceland by \nsupplementing provisions in existing legal instruments and facilitating their application. \nThe state receiving a request must in principle comply with the formalities and procedures \ninitiated by the requesting state. \nForms of assistance provided for by the Convention include: A.7.28 \n•  the handing over of objects that have been stolen or obtained by other criminal means \nand that are found in another Member State; \n• hearings by video or telephone; \n•  the setting up of a  joint investigation team by two or more EU Member States for a \nspecific purpose and for a limited period of time, as well as joint covert investigations; \n• requests for the interception of telecommunications. \nFraud A-7015 \nEFTA00022220\n\n(A.7.29] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nA.7.29 The 2001 Protocol to the EU Convention' deals with requests for banking information \nand is implemented by Chapter 4 of Part 1 of CICA 2003. \nC 326. 21.11.2001. p I.

However, as noted above (para A.7.17), \nonce the withdrawal process under Art 50 (including any transitional period) is complete, \nsome EU law measures, including the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal \nMatters and the European Investigation Order Directive, will be terminated unless UK \nthird-country access is successfully negotiated. The EU allows third-state participation in \nsome of its mutual legal assistance arrangements.' An alternative to negotiating third-state \naccess to the network of existing MLA agreements would be a UK—EU MLA treaty.2 Again, \nthe role of the CJEU would be highly contentious. \nI  See. eg, Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of \nNorway on the application of certain provisions of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual \nAssistance in Criminal Matters between the Member Sures of the European Union and the 2001 \nProtocol thereto 120001 OJ L26. \n2   See ft Davidson, 'Smut and Criminal Justice: The Future of the UK'sCooperation Relationship with the \nEU' [2017) Crim \nL R 5. 387. \n(iii) Council Framework Decision on the execution in the EU of orders freezing \nproperty or evidence \nA.7.31 After the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, the European Council first \nextended the mutual recognition principle to mutual legal assistance matters with the \nFramework Decision on pre-trial orders freezing property or evidence.This was adopted by \nthe EU Council of Ministers on 22 July 2003 on an initiative by Belgium, France, and \nSweden. Its purpose is to establish the rules under which a Member State is to recognise and \nexecute in its territory a freezing order issued by a  judicial authority of another Member \nState in the framework of criminal proceedings. \nI  20031577/J14A. 22 July 2003: \nOJ L \n196, \n2.08.2003. \nA.7.32 A 'freezing order' means any measure taken by a judicial authority in a Member State to \nprevent the destruction, transformation, displacement, etc of property. The evidence to \nwhich the Framework Decision applies includes objects, documents, or data which could \nbe produced as evidence in criminal proceedings. \nA.7.33 The Framework Decision (2003/577/JHA) was given effect to in Pan 1 of \nCICA \n2003' \nand by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (which replaces the Serious Organised Crime & \nPolice Act 2005). However, the scheme remained restricted to the freezing phase, such that \na  freezing order still needed to be accompanied by a  separate MIA request for the \nsubsequent transfer of the evidence to the issuing state. Because of this need to resort to \nco-existing MLA arrangements in any event, the 2003 scheme was seldom used in practice. \nA-7016 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022221\n\nA. \nIntroduction [A.7.35] \nCICA 2003, ss 10-12 and ss 20-27. CICA 2003 also gives effect to the EU Munn] Assistance \nConvention 2000 (12 July 2000) (the Convention established by the Council in accordance with An 34 \nof the Treaty on European Union. on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member SLIM \nof the European Union (OJ C 197, 12/07/2000 p  0003-0023)) and the Protocol to the 2000 \nConvention (21 November 2001) (the Protocol to the Convention on Marital Assistance in Criminal \nMatters between the Member States of the European Union (OJ C 326, 21/11/2001 p0001-0008)). \nCICA 2003 also implements other EU legislation, including the Convention \n981C \n216/01 on Driving \nDisqualifications (as to which, see aLso S.I. 3010 of 2008; The Mutual Recognition of Driving \nDisqualifications (Great Britain and Ireland) Regulations 2008). \nA Regulation on the Mutual Recognition of Freezing and Confiscation Orders has been A.7.34 \nproposed to replace and further develop this existing mutual recognition framework (the \n2003 Framework Decision and the Council Framework Decision (2006/783/HA) on the \napplication of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders)) The proposed \nRegulation aims to create 'a  uniform and more effective legal instrument to improve \ncross-border asset recovery'. 2  It is intended to resolve the issues caused by the implemen-\ntation of existing instruments. The draft Regulation covers a wider range of confiscation \nsuch as non-conviction-based confiscation (including some preventative confiscation). It \nalso standardizes procedures to improve efficiency. On 8 December 2017, the Council \nagreed a general approach on the proposal.3 The UK has indicated it wishes to opt in but \nthis initiative, like other mutual recognition instruments, will be affected when and if the \nUK withdraws from the EU. \nI  Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to \nconfiscation orders, OJ L 328. 24.11.2006. \n2   Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mutual recognition of \nfreezing and confiscation orders—General approach, Council Document 15104117, 8 December 2017. \n3   ibid. \n(iv) The Council Framework Decision 2008/978IJHA of 18 December 2008 on the \nEuropean evidence warrant for the purpose of obtaining objects, documents and \ndata for use in proceedings in criminal matters \nIn late 2008, the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant (EEW) was A.7.35 \nfinalised. The main purpose of the proposal was to consolidate the disparate schemes and \nto accelerate and simplify the process of gathering and transmitting evidence in criminal \ncases with a cross-border element. A simple form was to be sent between Member States' \nauthorities, including an order from the 'issuing state' (the state which sends the form) for \nthe 'executing state' to carry out certain activities. The EEW extended the mutual \nrecognition principle of the European Arrest Warrant to the transfer of limited types of \n'object \nkb documents and \ndata' among Member States in criminal proceedings.' However, \nthe EEW remained flawed as an effective cross-border instrument. It was only applicable to \nevidence already in existence and therefore restricted the spectrum of judicial cooperation \nin criminal matters with respect to such evidence. Because of its limited scope, competent \nauthorities were free to use the new regime or to use co-existing MLA procedures in any \ncase applicable to evidence falling outside of the scope of the EEW. The EEW specifically \nexcluded 'real time evidence such as the interviewing or taking of statements from \nsuspects, witnesses or victims, the interception of communications, the taking of DNA or \nbodily samples, evidence gathered as  a  result of ongoing monitoring or surveillance, or \nFraud A-7017 \nEFTA00022222\n\n[A.7.36] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nevidence that required analysis to be conducted? The EEW took eight years to come into \nbeing and its difficult history highlights the problems of pursuing prosecution initiatives in \nthis area. Even before it could be implemented it was overtaken by a new proposal for a \nDirective on the European Investigation Order (EIO). The EIO has now effectively \nreplaced the EEW. \nI  The EEW is limited to obtaining those 'object(s), documents and data from another member state that \nare already in existence—Art 1(1). See J.R.

The \nStockholm Programme referred to the existing mutual legal assistance system as 'frag-\nmented', complaining that the present arrangements permitted access to only limited \ncategories of evidence with a large number of grounds for refusal.2 Asa result, a compre-\nhensive mutual recognition initiative has now been produced—the European Investigation \nOrder (E1O).3\nI  European Council, Stockholm Programme—An open and secure Europe serving and protecting \ncitizens.

The key elements of \nthe Directive include a standardized format for requests; the application of the principle of \nmutual recognition to requests, together with timeframes for responding to requests. It also \nprescribes the grounds for refusal (eg Art 11(1)(f) of the Directive permits a refusal to \nexecute an EIO on human rights grounds). Amongst other investigative measures, the \nDirective enables the Executing State to: \n•  temporarily transfer persons held in custody for further investigation; \n•  summon witnesses to court to provide evidence by video conference at a hearing; \n•  transfer evidence already in the possession of the Executing State; and \n•  undertake certain covert investigations and intercept telecommunications. \nThe Directive does not apply to Schengen cross-border surveillance by police officers under \nthe Schengen Convention, or to the setting up of joint investigation teams and the \ngathering of evidence within such a team. \nA-7018 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022223\n\nA. \nIntroduction (A.7.391 \nThe EIO replaces the EEW and most other mutual legal assistance measures with a scheme \napplicable to all investigative measures and is  intended to be the sole legal instrument \nregulating the exchange of evidence and mutual legal assistance between EU Member \nStates. The scheme differs from the old framework in two crucial respects: first, it removes \nsome of the key protections attached to substantive provisions; and second, it operates by \nway of mutual recognition.' Member States had until 22 May 2017 to implement the \nDirective into domestic law. The UK opted into the Directive under Protocol 21 of the \nTFEU and transposed it via the Criminal Justice (European Investigation Order) Regula-\ntions 20172 with effect from 31 July 2017. (The UK General Election accounted for the \ndelay in transposition.) The Explanatory Memorandum to the Regulations explains: 'It \n[the Directive] largely relies on existing law enforcement tools such as search warrants and \nproduction orders, which broadly aligns with existing procedures under the Crime (Inter-\nnational Cooperation) Act 2003.'3 It also explains that, where there is currently no need for \ncourt involvement in domestic cases, ElOs will normally be made or validated by a \ndesignated public prosecutor (see Part 1 of Schedule 1); there are exceptions to this where \na request for an Order is made by a defendant or other prosecuting authority who will need \nto make an application to a court. Where a court would normally be involved in a domestic \ncase (for instance when issuing a  search warrant), only a  court will be able to make a \nEuropean investigation order. \nI  Sayers. `The European Investigation Order: Travelling without a \"roadmap\".

Arc 4(4)(a). \nIn summary, the Agreement gives USA law enforcement authorities access to bank A.7.46 \naccounts throughout the EU (and vice versa) in the context of investigations into serious \ncrimes, including terrorism, organized crime, and financial crime. It is intended to improve \npractical cooperation by reducing delays in mutual legal assistance. It also allows for the \ncreation of joint investigative teams and the possibility of videoconferencing. It  also \ncontains extensive provisions in relation to data protection and the provision of evidence \nand information. \nA recent Agreement between the United States and the European Union on the protection A.7.47 \nof personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecu-\ntion of criminal offences' applies privacy protections to data that is exchanged between law \nenforcement agencies in the EU and the USA. Those safeguards include limitations on data \nuse, prior consent from EU authorities before any onward transfer of data, a requirement \nto define data retention periods, and citizens' rights to access and correct data held about \nthem. The EU—USA umbrella agreement entered into force on 1 February 2017. The data \nprotection umbrella agreement is separate from the EU—USA privacy shield that facilitates \nthe transfer of personal data from the EU to the USA by businesses.2 Once the UK ceases \nto be a member of the EU, the EU—USA umbrella agreement will not apply to it. \n1 \nOJ \nL 336/3\n-13, 5.12.2016.

UK Requests to Foreign States for Assistance [A.7.126] \n(c) Procedure for obtaining a letter of request from a judicial authority \nThe application for a letter of request should be made to the court seized of the matter. A.7.123 \nTherefore, once the case has been committed, transferred, or sent to the Crown Court the \napplication should be made to that court. \nThe application should contain particulars of the offence which it  is  alleged has been A.7.124 \ncommitted or the grounds upon which it is suspected that an offence has been committed; \na statement of whether proceedings in respect of the offence have been instituted or the \noffence is being investigated; and particulars of the assistance requested in the form of a \ndraft letter of request. The common law duty of candour and disclosure attaching to an \napplicant for a domestic search warrant is  not applicable, even in modified form, to an \nauthority requesting assistance by way of a letter of request under s 7 (R (Unamengy Group \nHolding Pre Ltd) v Director of the Serious Fmsul Grier 120171 1 WLR 3302). \nThere are no general statutory provisions prescribing the contents of a letter of requestO A.7.125 \nhowever, in order to be effective, the letter must be as specific as possible about the \ncircumstances of the case and the assistance required. The requested state will almost \ncertainly know little about the case save what is contained in the letter of request and it is \ntherefore necessary to explain as much about the case as possible and to indicate precisely \nwhat assistance is required. S 2 of the MLA Guidelines contain detailed guidance on what \nshould be included in a letter of request. \nI  However. Art 14 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance provides that every request must \ncontain details of: (i) the authority making the request; (ii) the object of and the reason for the request; \n(iii) where possibk. the identity and nationality of the person concerned; (iv) the name and addressofthe \nperson to be served; (v) the offence involved and a summary of the facts. The content of some requests \nfor specialized assistance are prescribed in CICA \n2003. see eg s 43(6). \n(4) Transmission of the request under the Crime (International Co-operation) \nAct 2003, section EP \nCICA 2003, s 8(1) provides that a request for assistance under s 7 may be sent directly to A.7.126 \na court exercising jurisdiction in the place where the evidence is situated or to any authority \nrecognized by the government of the country in question as the appropriate authority for \nreceiving requests of that kind.2\nCICA 2003, s 8 implements Art 6 of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. \nThis provides that requests for mutual assistance may be transmitted directly between judicial authorities \nof Member States concerned, rather than through central authorities. Art 6(2) allows for transmission via \ncentral authorities to continue in specific cases. and Art 6(3) allows for the UK and Ireland to continue \nto route requests through a central authority. \n2   Under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 direct transmission was only \npermissible in urgent cases. \nFraud A-7031 \nEFTA00022236\n\n(A.7.127) Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nA.7.127 Rule 49.3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 20131 provides that where a  request for \nassistance under s 7 is made by a justice of the peace or a judge exercising the jurisdiction \nof the Crown Court, and is sent in accordance with s 8(1), the justices' clerk or the Crown \nCourt officer must send a copy of the letter of request to the Secretary of State as soon as \npracticable after the request has been made. \n1  SI \n2015/1490. in force 5 October \n2015. \nA.7.128 S 8(2) provides that if it is a request by a  judicial authority or a designated prosecuting \nauthority it may be sent to the Secretary of State' for forwarding to the court or authority \nmentioned in s  8(1). Indirect transmission via the Secretary of State2  under s  8(2) is \nnecessary if the requested country is not a Member State, if the executing authority is \nunknown, or if Art 6(8) of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance requires transmission \nvia the central authority, Art 6(8) requires that certain types of request for assistance, \nincluding requests for the temporary transfer of prisoners and notices of information from \njudicial records,4 be made through Members States' central authorities. \nI  In Scotland. the Lord Advocate. \n2  In practice, the UK Central Authority. \n3   See the Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003. pan \n40. \n4  CI European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.

Mutual legal assistance treaties place obligations on \nsignatories to comply with requests for assistance. Art 1 of the European Convention on \nMutual Assistance requires signatories to provide 'the widest measure of mutual assistance', \nand Art 3 requires signatories to execute any letter of request 'in the manner provided for \nby its law'.2\nI  See generally R v!

Art 4(3) of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters provides \nthat if the request cannot, or cannot fully, be executed in accordance with the requirements \nset by the requesting Member State, the authorities of the requested Member State must \ninform the requesting Member State and indicate the conditions under which it might be \npossible to execute the request. \nEg European Convention on Mutual Assistance.

S 9(2) limits the use to which the evidence can be put in the UK. The evidence may not, \nwithout the consent of the `appropriate overseas authority', be used for any purpose other \nthan that specified in the request.' The appropriate overseas authority means the authority \nrecognized by the government of the country in question as the appropriate authority for \nreceiving requests of the kind in question (s 9(6)). \nThis rule is analogous co the specialty rule in extradition law..

S 9 also renders evidence so obtained inadmissible in civil \nproceedings.2 The prohibition on onward use also includes onward disclosure.3 The \nprohibition continues notwithstanding that evidence is  adduced in open court in the \nUnited Kingdom?

The \nprosecuting authorities mentioned in s  43(4) are in relation to England and Wales and \nNorthern Ireland, a prosecuting authority designated by an order made by the Secretary of \nState, and in relation to Scotland, the Lord Advocate or a procurator fiscal. \nA.7.208 The assistance that may be requested under s 43 is any assistance in obtaining from a \nparticipating country one or more of the following (s 43(5)): \n•  information as to whether the person in question holds any accounts at  any banks \nsituated in the participating country; \n•  details of any such accounts; \n•  details of transactions carried out in any period specified in the request in respect of any \nsuch accounts. \nA-7038 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022243\n\nB. UK Requests to Foreign States for Assistance [A.7.215] \nS 43(6) provides that a request for assistance under s 43 must state the grounds on which A.7.209 \nthe authority making the request thinks that the person in question may hold any account \nat a bank which is situated in a participating country and (if possible) specify the bank or \nbanks in question; state the grounds on which the authority making the request considers \nthat the information sought to be obtained is likely to be of substantial value for the \npurposes of the investigation, and include any information which may facilitate compli-\nance with the request. \nFor the purposes of s 43, a person holds an account if the account is in his name or is held A.7.210 \nfor his benefit, or he has a power of attorney in respect of the account (s 43(7)). \n(ii) Monitoring banking transactions (Crime (International Co-operation) \nAct 2003, section 44) \nCICA 2003, s 44 governs requests for the monitoring of banking transactions. It imple- \nA.7.211 \nments Art 3 of the 2001 Protocol for the purpose of outgoing requests from the UK to \nother participating countries to monitor transactions conducted on a specified account or \naccounts. \nS 44(1) provides that if it appears to a judicial authority' in the UK on an application made A.7.212 \nby a  prosecuting authority, that the information which the applicant seeks to obtain is \nrelevant to an investigation in the UK into criminal conduct, the judicial authority may \nrequest assistance (CICA 2003, s 44). \nI  The judicial authorities are, in relation to England and Wales. any judge or JP; in relation to Scotland, \nany sheriff; in relation to Northern Ireland, any judge or resident magistrate (CICA 2003, s 44(2)). \nS 44(3) and s 44(4) are identical to s 43(3) and s 43(4) and permit designated prosecuting A.7.213 \nauthorities to make requests for assistance directly. \nThe assistance that may be requested under s  44 is any assistance in obtaining from a \nA.7.214 \nparticipating country details of transactions to be carried out in any period specified in the \nrequest in respect of any accounts at banks situated in that country. \n(iii) Sending requests under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, \nsections 43 and 44 \nRequests for assistance under CICA 2003, ss 43 or 441 are to be sent to the Secretary of A.7.215 \nState for forwarding to a court specified in the request and exercising jurisdiction in the \nplace where the information is  to be obtained, or to any authority recognized by the \nparticipating country in question as  the appropriate authority for receiving requests for \nassistance of the kind to which this s applies (s 45(1)). In cases of urgency the request may \nbe sent directly to the court (s 45(2)). \nOther than Scottish requests: see CICA 2003, s 45(3) \nand (4). \nFraud A-7039 \nEFTA00022244\n\n[A.7.2161 Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nC. Requests by Foreign States to the UK for Assistance \nin Providing Evidence \n(a) Introduction \nA.7.216 This section considers the relevant principles where the assistance requested from the UK \ninvolves the provision of evidence and information, including banking information. \nProvisions relating to restraint, confiscation, and forfeiture are considered later in this \nchapter.' \nI  See pars A.7.612. \n(b) Requests from foreign states for assistance in obtaining evidence \nA.7.217 This section examines the methods by which the UK grams assistance in obtaining \nevidence for use in criminal proceedings or investigations abroad.' The scheme for \ncompelling evidence for use outside the jurisdiction is exclusively statutory under CICA \n2003. Therefore, where Norwich Pharmatal proceedings were brought to obtain evidence \n(as distinct from information) for use overseas in criminal proceedings, it was held ire I? \n(Omar) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Afinin3 that the UK courts have \nno jurisdiction to order the provision of such evidence. The CICA 2003 regime accords \nministerial discretion, the confinement of requests to foreign courts and prosecuting \nauthorities, national security.' and Crown servant exemptions a  paramountcy which the \ncommon law remedy does not. The differences are so substantial that Parliament could not \nhave intended that the common law remedy should survive the introduction of CICA \n2003. Had Norwich PharmaraI proceedings been permissible in principle, s 13(2) CICA \n2003 would have required either the foreign prosecutor or the court to make an application \nto the UK. No request having been made to the foreign court, no foreign court had asked \nthe UK to assist. It is an integral part of the CICA 2003 statutory scheme that assistance is \nsought by the requesting courts To permit the proceedings to proceed without a request \nfrom a foreign court would evade this principal requirement of the CICA 2003 statutory \nregime. In deciding whether to make a request to the UK, the foreign court would have to \nconsider the submissions of the foreign government as a party to its proceedings; which \nprocess should not be circumvented. In any event, the Court also held that it would not be \nin the interests of comity to entertain the application when a deliberate decision had been \nmade not to make an application in the foreign court and the fairness of the foreign court \nhad not been called into question. \n1  The UK can also provide assistance in relation to administrative and clemency proceedings, which are \ndefined in CICA 2003. s 51(1). These are not covered in this chapter. \n2   Although the Court of Appeal held that the distinction was immaterial: 120141 QB 112, pan 12. \n3   120131 EWCA Civ 118. \n4  See. eg, Al Famums v Serrewy ofSmte forte Home Deportment 120151 EWFIC 468 (Admin). \n5  See pan A.7.222. \nA-7040 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022245\n\nC. Requests by Foreign States to the UK [A.7.222] \nThe principal provisions are contained in Chapter 2 of Part 1 of CICA 2003. Processing A.7.218 \nsuch a request for assistance under CICA1 involves essentially three stages: \n•  assessment of the request and determination of the most appropriate method of giving \neffect to it; \n•  execution of the request; \n•  transmission of the evidence. \nI  It should be noted that there exists legal authority for intelligence sharing outside the CICA regime in s \n1(5) of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (previously s 3 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act \n2005 and previously s 2 of the Police Act 1997). Therefore. the voluntary provision of intelligence to \nforeign law enforcement agencies does not offend CICA, nor the Human Rights Act, even whew that \ninformation is subsequently used to seek extradition from the United Kingdom: H v LoniAtivoraw 2011 \nSCL \n978. \n(i) Incoming requests fir assistance: initial steps \nCICA 2003,s 13 provides that where a request for assistance in obtaining evidence in a part A.7.219 \nof the UK is received by the 'territorial authority' for that part of the UK, the authority may: \n•  if the conditions ins 14 are met, arrange for the evidence to be obtained under s 15, or \n•  direct that a search warrant be applied for under or by virtue of ss 16 or 17.1\nI  Or, in relation to evidence in Scotland, s 18. \nS 28(9) defines the 'territorial authority' in relation to evidence in England and Wales or A.7.220 \nNorthern Ireland as the Secretary of State, and in relation to Scotland as being the Lord \nAdvocate.' \nI   Although the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters allows for direct transmission \nof requests (see Art 6(3)) the Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003. pan 53. explain why the UK decided to \nopt out of direct transmission for incoming requests: 'Direct transmission is difficult to apply in our \ndomestic system where jurisdiction is based largely on function rather than geography, and where the \nsame authorities are not necessarily competent to both issue and execute letters of request. Misdirection \nof requests sent directly to the wrong authority would create delays, defeating the purpose of direct \ntransmission which is to speed up the process.' \nS 27(1)(a) states that the Treasury may by order provide, in relation to England and Wales A.7.221 \nor Northern Ireland, that the territorial authority's functions under various sections of \nCICA 2003, including ss 13-15, are to be exercisable instead in prescribed circumstances \nby the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. In exercise of this power the Treasury has \nmade the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Exercise of Functions) Order \n2013.1\nI  SI \n2013/2733. \n(I) The overseas authorities which may request assistance \nS 13(2) provides that the request for assistance may be made only by a court exercising A.7.222 \ncriminal jurisdiction, or a prosecuting authority, in a country outside the UK; any other \nauthority in such a country which appears to the territorial authority to have the function \nof making such requests for assistance;' or any international authority mentioned in s \nFraud A-7041 \nEFTA00022246\n\n[A.7.223] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \n13(3), namely, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) or any other body \nor person competent to make a  request of the kind to which this s applies under any \nprovisions adopted under the Treaty on European Union (ie Eurojust).2 For the purposes of \ns  13(2)(a), a  'prosecuting authority' does not mean a  prosecuting authority with the \nrequisite authority to transmit a  request for assistance. An entity either is  or is  not a \n'prosecuting authority'. If it is, it does not cease to be a 'prosecuting authority' because of a \nchallenge (successful or otherwise) to its competence in issuing any particular request for \nassistance. A prosecutor which lacked authority under the law of the requesting state to \nissue the letter or request remained a prosecuting authority for the purposes of s  13(2) \nCICA 2003.3 However, as discussed below! 'obvious unlawfulness under the law of the \nrequesting state remains a  matter relevant to the exercise of the Secretary of State's \ndiscretion. \neg, examining magistrates. see Government Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003, pan 51. \n2 \nGovernment Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003. pan \n51. \n3  a  Morgan Chase Bank National Association v Director ofthe Serious Fraud Offlee12012) Lloyd's Rep FC \n655. pan 56. \n4   See pan A.7.225:O Morgan ame Bank Nationablnoriation v Direetorofthe Serious Fraud Office [2012) \nLloyd's Rep FC 655. para 66. \n(2) The derision whether or not to grant assistance: general \nA.7.223 In all cases the territorial authority must be satisfied that the request for assistance can \nproperly be described as a request for obtaining 'evidence' and thus that it falls within CICA \n2003, s  13(1). However having regard to the broad definition of evidence in s 51(1) it is \nunlikely that a request for assistance will fail for this reason.'

If they are, the authority must then decide \nwhether it is appropriate for the UK to grant assistance. The territorial authority has a \ndiscretion whether to grant assistance. In exercising this discretion the territorial authority \nmust take into account any relevant treaty grounds for refusing assistance.' A decision \nwhether or not to grant assistance is amenable to judicial review.2 \nI  R v Secretary ofState fir the Home Department ex p Partitives: Spa (19971 \n1 WLR 743. 758. \n2   R (Wafter) v Secretary ofSrate forth e Horne Department (20071 I WLR 150. pan 28.

Requests by Foreign States to the UK [A.7.225] \nthus the fact that statutory conditions for the grant of assistance are satisfied does not A.7.225 \nnecessarily compel the territorial authority to grant assistance. The grant of assistance is an \nexercise of the power of the State. The UK executing authority has a discretion whether to \ngrant assistance.' There may be rare cases where it is not appropriate to do so.2 The ambit \nof the discretion is, however, informed by the policy of mutual assistance underlying CICA \n2003, together with the reality of what the Secretary of State is equipped and resourced to \ndo.3 As the High Court has observed, the process is  not a  trial; it leads only to the \ntransmission of evidence to the requesting state where, if it is to be used, one can assume \nthat the criminal defendant will have the opportunity of answering it. Secondly, such \nrequests are made by friendly, foreign countries with which the UK has treaty or similar \nobligations of mutual cooperation. The expectation is therefore that the UK will comply \nwith the request unless there are 'compelling reasons' for not doing so and will do so as \nquickly as possible. Any requirement of procedural fairness must be fashioned with those \nconsiderations firmly in mind.4 The mere fact that evidence obtained under a letter of \nrequest would be made available to third parties in the requesting state is not of itself a \ncompelling reasons Neither is mere delay, proportionality, or asserted futility.6 Relevant \n'compelling reasons do include,' but are however not limited to those instances enumer-\nated in the applicable Convention.8 Other considerations include whether the requesting \nstate has acted in good faith in the interests of justice\" and whether there are particular \nfactors making assistance inappropriate, for example, if a person affected by the request has \nalready been tried for the alleged olfence.70 It would also generally be wrong for the \nSecretary of State to exercise the discretion in favour of answering a request when it was \n'obviously unlawful' in the sense that it was undisputed or incapable of being properly \ndisputed that the request was made unlawfully according to the law of the requesting state. \nIt will however only be possible to establish this where there exists no, or no room for \nproper, dispute as to the unlawfulness in question on the evidence. Otherwise, it is not the \nfunction of the Secretary of State to determine genuine and live rival contentions of foreign \nlaw.\" \nI  These principles are nor limited to assistance granted under s 13.

In particular, the territorial authority \nis a public authority for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 and so must \nact compatibly with the Convention rights of any person likely to be affected by the grant \nof assistance. A grant of assistance may, for example, involve the infringement of a person's \nprivacy rights under Art 8(1)1 and so need to be justified under Art 8(2). It may also raise \nissues about the fairness of any trial in the requesting state, in cases of past or prospective \nflagrant denial of justice.2 Accordingly, the territorial authority is required to assess the \ncircumstances of each request to ensure that the measures it authorizes are both necessary \nand proportionate. However, ordinarily and a fortiori where the requesting country is party \nto the ECHR, any Art 6 or Art 8 concerns are best left for resolution in the courts of the \nrequesting state.3 In Ismail v Secretary of State fi r the Home Department! the Supreme \nCourt considered the extent of the Secretary of State's discretion when serving a  foreign \njudgment under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, s 1. It concluded that \nservice of a judgment was not the same as enforcement of it. The Supreme Court held that, \nin circumstances where service would not have a  direct and material impact on the \nrecipient, the Secretary of State was not under an obligation to investigate any conse-\nquences of it. However, the court also noted that there may be cases where service of a \njudgment would engage Art 6 ECHR, necessitating further investigation. \nR (Akimbo) vSerretary ofState for the Home Department 120011 EWHC787 Mmin.

Requests by Foreign States to the UK [A.7.239] \n(2) The hearing \nIf the territorial authority nominates a court under s 15 a notice of nomination is sent to the A.7.235 \ncourt.' Schedule 1 to CICA 2003 is headed 'Proceedings of a Nominated Court under s 15' \nand contains detailed provisions concerning these proceedings. \n1 By convention, the court nominated is that at which the Chief Magistrate sirs. Until 2011. that was the \n'City of Westminster' magistrates court in Horseferry Road. Following its closure, the Chief Magistrates' \ncourt is now the 'Westminster magistrates court in Marylebone Road. The court's address is 181 \nMarylebone Road, London WI 5BR: tel: 020 3126 3010; fa: 020 3126 \n3011. \nPara 1 of Schedule 1 provides that the nominated court shall have the like powers for A.7.236 \nsecuring the attendance of a witness for the purpose of the proceedings as it has for the \npurpose of other proceedings before it. The court can therefore issue a witness summons to \nsecure the witnesses attendance in precisely the same manner as in domestic matters.' \n1 Domestic powers include Magistrates Courts Act 1980.5 97 (magistrates' courts); Criminal Procedure \n(Attendance of Witnesses) Act 1965 s 2, (Crown Court). \nPara 3 of Schedule 1 empowers the court to administer oaths in the normal manner. \nA.7.237 \nThe procedure is governed by Part 49 of the Criminal Procedure Rules \n2015.' \nRule 49.4 A.7.238 \nprovides that a court nominated under s 15(1) may determine who may appear or take part \nin the proceedings under Schedule 1  before the court and whether a  party to the \nproceedings is entitled to be legally represented; and may direct that the public be excluded \nfrom those proceedings if it thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of justice. Generally, \nthe requesting state and the witness are entitled to be represented, and, if he has notice of \nthe nomination, the defendant in the foreign proceedings may also be represented. The \nprovisions of ss13-15 have been held to be compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. \nIn particular, the ability of the UK court to withhold notification of the process from the \nsuspect in the interests of an ongoing investigation does not offend Art 8 of the European \nConvention on Human Rights.2 \n2015/1490, in force 5 October \n2015-\n2  CA& v Frame 2007 JC 4 \nRule 49.5 provides that where a court is nominated under s  15(1) the justices' clerk or A.7.239 \nCrown Court officer shall enter in an overseas record details of the request in respect of \nwhich the notice under s  15(1) was given; the date on which, and place at  which, the \nproceedings under Schedule 1 took place; the name of any witness who gave evidence at the \nproceedings in question; the name of any person who took part in the proceedings as a legal \nrepresentative or an interpreter, whether a witness was required to give evidence on oath or \n(by virtue of s 5 of the Oaths Act 1978) after making a solemn affi rmation; and whether the \nopportunity to cross-examine any witness was refused.

It is for the \nnominated court to decide upon the appropriate procedure where a decision has to be \nmade as to whether an interference with the right under Art 8(1) is justified under Art 8(2). \nIn so doing the court must consider whether to give notice of the application to and to hear \nsubmissions from any person whose Article 8 rights will be or may be infringed by giving \neffect to the application.4\n1  Evidence is not necessarily restricted to direct evidence for use at trial; R v Stormy ofState for the Home \nDepartment ex p Fininwst SpA (1997] 1  WLR 743.

This privilege permits a witness in criminal proceedings to refuse to answer \nquestions which might tend to incriminate him or her by exposing him to proceedings for \na  criminal offence, for forfeiture, or for the recovery of a  penalty.2 The judge must be \nsatisfied from the circumstances that there is reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the \nwitness from his being compelled to answer.3 If objection is overruled and the witness gives \nevidence, the accused cannot afterwards object.4\nMIS Guidelines. p 18. \n2  Rio Tinto Zne Corpn is Westinghouse Electric Corpn (1978) AC 547; Must v Park Lane Hotel(1942) 2 KB \n253. \n3    Reyes (1861)1 B & S 311 (witness pardoned for offence: possibility of impeachment too remote EO afford \nprivilege): Rio Tinto Zine Carpi is Westinghouse Bernie Corporation (1978) AC 547; Den Nonke Bank \nAM v Antonatos \n(1999) QB 271. \n4   ZnArke \n(1870) 11 \nCox \n499. \nA witness may also refuse to produce documentary evidence or give oral testimony on the A.7.248 \nground that the information sought is privileged.

In deciding what \ncases to adopt, the SFO has stated that: 'the Director will take into account all the \ncircumstances of the case and consider: whether the apparent criminality undermines UK \nPlc commercial or financial interests in general and in the City of London in particular; \nwhether the actual or potential financial loss involved is high; whether actual or potential \neconomic harm is significant; whether there is a significant public interest element; and \nwhether there is new species of fraud'.' \nI  See <ImpsdAvww.sio.gov.ukJpublicationsiguidance-policy-and-protocols>. \nA.7.304 Where a case has been referred to the Director of the SFO under s 15(2) he may use his \ninvestigatory powers under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987.

However, the SFO also has a range ofcoercive powers \nat its disposal under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 in relation to interviews and the \nproduction of documents. They are coercive in the sense that a person who fails to answer \nquestions or produce documents as required is liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence \nunder s 2(13), (14), or (16). \nIn summary the SFO's coercive powers are as follows:1 A.7.307 \n• s 2(2) allows the SFO to require any person to answer any relevant questions or otherwise \nfurnish information with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation, including \nquestions about confidential matters; however, s 2(9) entitles the person interviewed to \nrefuse to answer on the grounds of legal professional privilege; \n• s 2(3) allows the SFO to require any person to produce to it any relevant documents? \nincluding confidential documents, but not including documents subject to legal profes-\nsional privilege.3 It can also require the person producing them to provide an explana-\ntion.* of them; \n• where the SFO considers that to require a person to produce relevant documents would \nbe likely to result in them being destroyed, hidden, or moved from the jurisdiction, so as \nto frustrate any criminal investigation, s 2(4) allows it to apply to a court for a warrant to \nsearch that person's premises and seize the documents. Before granting a search warrant, \ns  2(4)(a) requires the JP to be satisfied either that the person concerned has failed to \ncomply with a notice under s 2(3), that it is not practicable to serve such a notice, or that \nservice would jeopardise the investigation. \nI  See Chapter A.2 for more detail \n2 \nHamihon v \nNaviede \n(19951 2 \nAC 75. \n3   Criminal Justice Act 1987. s \n2(9). \n4  For the meaning of 'explanation' in \nthe similarly worded \ns \n447(5)(2)(10 \nof the Companies Act \n1985 see \nAnorney-Getterall Reference QS 2) of 1998 120001 QB 412.

It was held that s 3(3) of the Criminal \nJustice Act 1987 did not override rule 31.22 of the Civil Procedure Rules. However the \ncourt held that the public interest in the investigation or prosecution of a specific offence \nof serious or complex fraud took precedence over the merely general concern of the courts \nto control the collateral use of compulsorily disclosed documents. In the absence of other \nfactors, the court's discretion should, as a matter of principle, prima fade be exercised in \nfavour of compliance with a notice under s 2(3) of the 1987 Act; by itself the additional \nfactor that the documents had been brought within the jurisdiction for the purposes of \ndisclosure by a  foreign litigant himself brought compulsorily before the English court \nshould not be regarded as a reasonable excuse for non-compliance with the notice; and the \ncourts should be prepared to grant permission under CPR 31.22 for their collateral use in \nproduction to the Director of the SFO. \nI  120051 I Vr/LR 104. \nA-7102 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022257\n\nC.

These latter \nwarrants are considered below.' \nI  Pursuant co the recommendation in R (Rawl/mon and Hunter Trustees) v Central Criminal Court [2013) \n1 WLR 1364. applications for s 2 CIA 1987 search warrants are now governed by Pt 47. s 7 of the \nCriminal Procedure Rules 2015 (rr 47.29-47.33: SI 2015/1490. in force 5 October 2015) and the forms \nissued thereunder by the Lord Chief Justice. \nA.7.318 S 2(4) provides that on information' laid on oath by a member of the SFO, a JP,2 if satisfied, \nin relation to any documents, that there are reasonable grounds for believing that either a \nperson has failed to comply with a s 2(3) notice; that it is not practicable to serve a s 2(3) \nnotice in relation to them; or that the service of such a notice in relation to them might \nseriously prejudice the investigation; and there are reasonable grounds for believing that \nthere are such documents on the premises specified in the information, he may issue a \nwarrant as is mentioned in s 2(5). \nI  The person affected by the warrant is generally entitled to sight of the information in order that he can \ntake advice as CO its legality (R (Energy Financing Team Limited) v Director of the Seriora Fraud Office \n120061 I  WLR 1316. pan 24(10)). Authorities possess no right co unilaterally redact that letter or \nInformation (R (S, F ci• L) v Chief Constable of the British Transport Police [2014) 1 WLR 1647. pans \n109-115): and, in the event that they wish to withhold any of its concerns from the person affected, they \nmust apply for a  P11 order (Comminioner of Police for the Metropolis v  Bangs 12014) EWHC 546 \n(Admin)).

Where an appropriate person \naccompanies a constable, he may exercise the powers conferred by s 2(5) but only in the \ncompany, and under the supervision, of the constable (s 2(6A)). An `appropriate person \nA-7104 release 13nul 19 \nEFTA00022259\n\nC. Requests by Foreign States to the UK (A.7.3221 \nmeans a member of the SFO or some person who is not a member of that Office but whom \nthe Director has authorized to accompany the constable (s 2(7)). \nThe issue of a search warrant is a serious matter. In addition to the duty to place before the A.7.321 \ncourt all the material necessary to the grant of a warrant,' there is a duty of candour upon \nthe SFO; there must be full and complete disclosure to the judge, including disclosure of \nanything that might militate against the grant.2 Misrepresentation or non-disclosure in \neither the information or the oral evidence to the judge will invalidate any warrant obtained \nwhere the errors or omissions might well (not would in fact) have made a difference to the \ndecision to grant the warrant.3 The current practice under s  2(4) of not placing the \nunderlying material before the judge' means that the duty of candour is  even more \nimportant than usual; there is a very heavy duty placed on the SFO to ensure that what is \nput before the judge is clear and comprehensive so that the judge can rely on it and form his \njudgment on the basis of a presentation in which he has complete trust and confidence as \nto its accuracy and completeness. Cases in the financial markets investigated by the SFO are \nlikely to require the judge to be familiar with the commercial and market background.That \nbackground must be set out in the written presentation to the judge. The transactions must \nthen be explained in a  coherent and analytical manner. The allegations of reasonable \nsuspicion must then be set out. What is alleged must be verified by persons expert in the \nmarket or accounting practices whose independent advice has been expressly sought. A \nrecord of that verification should be retained by the SFO. Not only must the case for \nreasonable suspicion be put, but the matters that might undermine that case must be \nenumerated. The skill and experience required to prepare a  presentation of that kind \ncannot be underestimated.5\nR (Redknapp) p Commissioner °pm Ciry of-London  Police (20091 1 WLR 209. \n2   Re Stanford (20101 1 WLR 941. pan 191; R (Rawlimon and Hunter Trustees) p Central Criminal Court \n(2013) I  WLR 1364, pans 81-2; G v Commiaioner of Mice of the Metropolis (20111 EWHC 3331 \n(Mmin): R (Dula° v Chehntfora' Magistrates Court 120131 1 WLR 220: fi v Zinga 120131 Lloyd's Rep. \nPC 102. pan \n15: \nR (AB 6 CD) v Huddenfidd Magistrates' Court 120151 I WLR 4737. paras 11-20; It \n(Gortate Properry Management Ltd) s' Southwark Gown Court 120141 2 Cr App R 12. pans 22-28: ft \n(Milh)v Sussex Police (2015) 1 WLR 2199. pans 38-40.This includes issues oflaw: R (VisciternOv Brent \nMagistrates Court (2012) 176 JP \n705. \n3  It (Mills) V Sussex Police 120151 1 WLR 2199. pans 47-64; overturning It (Rawlinson and Hunter \nTrustees) s' Central Criminal Court (20131 1 WLR 1364. paras 171-179 and It (Goode) v Nottingham \nCrown Court 120141 ACD 6. \n4  A practice which should be considered by a body such as the Criminal Procedure Ruk Committee or an \nad hoc body established for that purpose: R (Rawlinson and Hunter Trustees) v Central Criminal Court \n(2013) I WLR 1364. pan 90.

A judge to whom an application for a A.7.322 \nwarrant is made must therefore be scrupulously careful to ensure that all the relevant \nstatutory conditions are satisfied. It is  not sufficient that the judge considers that the \ninformation and evidence presented is reasonable. The judge must personally be satisfied \nthat there is before the judge sufficient material on which it is proper to grant the warrant, \nincluding grounds for reasonable suspicion.'

The warrant \nmust only specify items that are relevant to the specific investigation and the specific \noffence being investigated .s Where categories of documents to be seized are defined by \nreference to a time period, the period must bear some reasonable relationship of propor-\ntionality to the period relevant to the alleged offence. \nR v Central Criminal Court exp AID Holdings Ltd119921 Crim LR 669. The particularity required will \ndepend upon the breadth of the investigation in issue, and the question of where the balance lies in an \nindividual case will rarely be answered by reference to prior authority.

Instead, \nthe aggrieved party must apply directly for judicial review.2 In Barclays Bank pie (Trading as \nBarclaycard) v Taylor3 the Court of Appeal held that, irrespective of whether a notice under \nSchedule 1 of PACE is defective, an access order once made, being valid on its face, is fully \neffective until set aside by due process; and that since a banker's duty of confidentiality to \nhis client is qualified by the exception of disclosure under compulsion of law, a bank which \ncomplies with an access order is not thereby in breach of its duty to its client.4 The same \nprinciples apply to search warrants generally.5 \nI  Whether under s 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (R (Goode) v Nottingham Gown Court \n120131 EWHC 1726 (Admin). pan 51: R (Graudhary) v Bristol Crown Court 120161 1 WLR 631): or \notherwise (R v Liverpool Crown Court ex p Wimpey pit \n[1991] COD 370). \n2  It (Goode) v  Nottingham Gown Court [2013] EWHC 1726 (Admin). pan 51; Lees v  Solihull \nMagistrates Court [2013] EWHC \n3779 \n( \nAdmin), \npan 56; Hantlambous v St Alban: Gown Court \n[2018] UKSC I. pars 10. \n3   119891 1  WLR 1066. \n4  The court went on to say that since such an order could not be made by consent and the responsibility \nfor deciding whether the access conditions were satisfied rested with the judge making the order, and \nsince the public interest in assisting the police investigation of crime might be fnistrated if the account \nholder knew of the application. it is not necessary for the purpose of giving business efficacy to the \nbanker—client relationship to imply an obligation that the bank, in the absence of special circumstances \nknown only to \nitself \nshould either oppose or probe the application or supporting evidence, or that it \nshould inform its client of the application. \n5  A  warrant is  'valid unless and until it is  quashed.

References in Chapter 2 of \nPan 1 of CICA 2003 to an overseas freezing order include its accompanying certificate \n(s \n20(5)); \n•  the certificate must be signed by or on behalf of the court or authority which made or \nconfirmed the order; include a statement as to the accuracy of the information given in \nit; if k is not in English, include a translation of it into English (or, if appropriate, Welsh) \n(s 20(6)); \n•  the order must be accompanied by a request for the evidence to be sent to a court or \nauthority mentioned in s 13(2), unless the certificate indicates when such a request is \nexpected to be made (s 20(7)). \nIn relation to clause 20(3)(c) of the Bill (now CICA 2003, s 20(3)(c)) the Attorney-General said during \nthe Committee stage in the House of Lords (see HL Deb 23 January 2003. \nGC84 and 85): '... the \npurpose of Clause 20(3)(c) is to cover all judicial authorities in ocher EU countries.

Before giving effect to the overseas freezing \norder, the nominated court must give the chief officer of police an opportunity to be heard \n(s 21(4)). \nThe court may decide not to give effect to the overseas freezing order only if, in its opinion, A.7.446 \none of the following conditions is met (s 21(4)). The first condition is that, if the person \nwhose conduct is in question were charged in the participating country with the offence to \nwhich the overseas freezing order relates or in the UK with a corresponding offence, he \nwould be entitled to be discharged under any rule of law relating to previous acquittal or \nconviction (s 21(6)). The second condition is that giving effect to the overseas freezing \norder would be incompatible with any of the Convention rights within the meaning of the \nHuman Rights Act \n1998 (s 21(7)). \n(ix) Giving Ort to the overseas freezing order \nS \n22 of CICA 2003 provides the mechanism whereby the nominated court gives effect to \nA.7.447 \nthe overseas freezing order. \nS \n22(1) provides that the nominated court is to give effect to the overseas freezing order by \nA.7.448 \nissuing a  warrant authorizing a  constable to enter the premises to which the oversews \nfreezing order relates and search the premises to the extent reasonably required for the \npurpose of discovering any evidence to which the order relates, and to seize and retain any \nevidence fin  which he is authorized to search. But, in relation to England and Wales and \nNorthern Ireland, so far as the overseas freezing order relates to excluded material or special \nprocedure material' the court is to give effect to the order by making a production order \n(s 22(2)). \nI  As defined in CICA 2003. s \n28(3). \nFraud A-7123 \nEFTA00022278\n\n[A.7.449] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nA.7.449 S  26(1) provides that the court may not issue a  warrant under s  22 in respect of any \nevidence unless the court has reasonable grounds for believing that it does not consist of or \ninclude items subject to legal privilege, excluded material, or special procedure material. S \n26(l) does not prevent a warrant under s 22(5) being issued for special procedure material \nor excluded material. \nA.7.450-500 A production order is an order for the person who appears to the court to be in possession \nof the material to produce it  to a  constable before the end of the period of seven days \nbeginning with the date of the production order or such longer period as  the production \norder may specify. The constable may take away any material produced to him under a \nproduction order; and the material is to be treated for the purposes of s 21 of PACE as if it \nhad been seized by the constable (s 22(3)). \nA.7.501 If a person fails to comply with a production order, the court may (whether or not it deals \nwith the matter as a contempt of court) issue a warrant under s 22(1) in respect of the \nmaterial to which the production order relates (s 22(5)). \nA.7.502 S 23 provides that the nominated court may postpone giving effect to an overseas freezing \norder in respect of any evidence in order to avoid prejudicing a criminal investigation which \nis taking place in the UK or, if under an order made by a court in criminal proceedings in \nthe UK, the evidence may not be removed from the UK. \n(x) Evidence seized under the order \nA.7.503 S 24(1) of CICA 2003 provides that any evidence seized by or produced to the constable \nunder s 22 is to be retained by him until he is given a notice under s 24(2) or authorized to \nrelease it under s 25(2). \nA.7.504 By s 24(2), if the overseas freezing order was accompanied by a request for the evidence to \nbe sent to a court or authority mentioned in s  13(2), or the territorial authority subse-\nquently receives such a request, the territorial authority may by notice require the constable \nto send the evidence to the court or authority that made the request. \n(xi) Release of evidence held under the order \nA.7.505 On an application made by a person mentioned in CICA 2003, s 25(1), the nominated \ncourt may authorize the release of any evidence retained by a constable under s 24 if, in its \nopinion the condition in s 21(6) or (7) is met (double jeopardy and human rights), or the \noverseas freezing order has ceased to have effect in the participating country. \nA.7.506 In relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the persons who may make such \nan application are the chief officer of police to whom a copy of the order was sent, the \nconstable, or any other person affected by the order (s 25(2)). \nA-7124 release 13/Jul \n19 \nEFTA00022279\n\nC.

Art 3 provides for requests to be made for a specified bank \naccount to be monitored during a specified period of time. Such a request might be made \nsubsequent to an Art 1 request for bank details or in cases where the investigator already has \nthe details of the relevant account.

The UK is also able to restrain assets at  the request of \nforeign states. \nA.7.613 Prior to the coming into force of the POCA Order, foreign requests for assistance in \nrestraint and confiscation matters were dealt with by different statutory regimes depending \nupon whether the request related to a drugs offence or a non-drugs offence.' The POCA \nOrder simplifies the law by providing a  single scheme for the enforcement of foreign \nconfiscation orders and the provision of assistance in obtaining restraint orders. \n1  DrugTrallickingAcc 1994 (Designated Countries andTerritories) Order \n19%. \nSI 1996/2880:Criminal \nJustice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) Order 1991, SI \n1991/2873. \nA.7.614 Whereas under the previous statutory regimes applications for restraint orders at the \nrequest of foreign states and the enforcement or overseas confiscation orders were made to \nthe High Court, under the POCA Order the application is made to the Crown Court. \nA-7134 release 13/Jul 19 \nEFTA00022289\n\nD. Mutual Legal Assistance in Relation to Restraint [A.7.619] \n(ii) Commencement and temporal scope of the proceeds of Crime Act 2002 \n(External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 \nThe POCA Order came into force on 1 January 2006. From that date, requests to the UK A.7.615 \nfor assistance in restraint and confiscation matters have been dealt with according to its \nterms.' \nI  See Perry v Serious Organised Crime Agency (2013) 1 AC 182. \npans 58-64.134-135. \nArt 8 of the POCA Order provides that the Crown Court may make a restraint order if A.7.616 \neither of the conditions in Art 7 is satisfied. Art 7(4) of the POCA Order provides that in \ndetermining whether these conditions are satisfied, the court must have regard to the \ndefinitions in s 447(1), (4)—(8), and (11) of POCA. S 447(8) of POCA defines 'criminal \nconduct' to include conduct that is criminal in the UK and conduct which would be \ncriminal if it had been committed in the UK. \nIt follows that the Crown Court can make a restraint order under the POCA Order at the A.7.617 \nrequest of a foreign state provided that the conduct alleged would have been criminal in the \nUK at the time it was committed. Unlike in the case of domestic restraint and confiscation \norders made under Part 2  of POCA, the POCA Order is  not restricted to offences \ncommitted after 24 March 2003, or after the date it came into force, because it does not \ncontain any equivalent of Arts 3 and 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Commence-\nment No. 5, Transitional Provisions, Savings and Amendment) Order \n2003,1 and s 447(7) \nof POCA does not restrict the meaning of 'criminal conduct' to conduct occurring after \nany particular date. \nSI \n2003/333. \nThus, the UK can grant assistance and the court can make a restraint order in relation to an \noffence whenever it was committed.' The application is  usually made without notice \nalthough there is an obligation to make material disclosure.2\nGovernment oft& United States ofAmorica si Montgomery (2001) 1 WLR 196. pan 30. in relation to \nthe Criminal Janice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) Order 1991, SI \n199112873. \n2  Darden, of the SF° v A (2007) EWCA Crim \n1927: \nAiming Bendrovg Banks: Snow (In Bankruptcy) v \nAntonov (2013) MEW 131 (Comm). pans 50-55.

A request \nunder Art 6(5) may include a request for statements which may be used as evidence. \nA.7.623 Where a request concerns relevant property which is in Scotland or Northern Ireland as \nwell as England or Wales, so much of the request as concerns such property is to be dealt \nwith under Part 3 or 4 of the POCA Order, respectively. \n(v) The Crown Courts power to make a restraint order at the request \nof a foreign state \nA.7.624 The Crown Court's powers to make a restraint order pursuant to an external request are \ncontained in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the POCA Order. Art 8 provides that the Crown Court \nmay make a restraint order if either condition in Art 7 is satisfied. \nA.7.625 Art 7(4) provides that in determining whether the conditions in Art 7 are satisfied and \nwhether the request is an external request within the meaning of POCA, the court must \nhave regard to the definitions in s 447(1), (4)—(8), and (11). Evidence must not be excluded \nin restraint proceedings on the grounds that it is hearsay evidence.t \n1\n \nibid. \nArt 13. \nA.7.626 The definitions ins 447(1), (4)—(8), and (11) of POCA are as follows: \nA-7136 release 13/Jul 19 \nEFTA00022291\n\nD. Mutual Legal Assistance in Relation to Restraint [A.7.629] \n•  S 447(1) provides that an external request is a request by an overseas authority to prohibit \ndealing with relevant property which is identified in the request.' \n•  S  447(4)—(8) provides as follows. Property is  all property, wherever situated,2  and \nincludes money; all forms of property, real or personal, heritable or moveable; things in \naction and other intangible or incorporeal property (s 447(4)). Property is obtained by a \nperson if he obtains an interest in it (s 447(5)). References to an interest, in relation to \nproperty other than land, include references to a right (including a right to possession) \n(s 447(6)). Property is relevant property if there are reasonable grounds to believe that it \nmay be needed to satisfy an external order which has been or which may be made \n(s 447(7)). Criminal conduct is conduct which constitutes an offence in any part of the \nUK, or would constitute an offence in any part of the UK if it occurred there (s 447(8)). \n•  S 447(11) provides that an overseas authority is an authority which has responsibility in \na country or territory outside the UK for making a request to an authority in another \ncountry or territory (including the UK) to prohibit dealing with relevant property; for \ncarrying out an investigation into whether property has been obtained as a result of or in \nconnection with criminal conduct; or for carrying out an investigation into whether a \nmoney laundering offence has been committed. \n1  The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) (Amendment) Order 2013/2604 (in \nforce II November 2013) makes provision for the obtaining by an 'enforcement authority✓ (as to which \nsee An 141 R) to obtain from the High Court (in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland) or the Court of \nSession (in Scotland) a prohibition order to prevent dealing with relevant property in the UK which is \nthe subject of an external request. within the meaning of s 447(1) of POCA.The provisions (new Pts 4A \nand 4B inserted into the External Requests Order 2005) correspond (subject to specified modifications) \nto the civil recovery provisions in POCA.

No account is to be taken of any obligation of a defendant or a recipient of a tainted \ngift if the obligation conflicts with the object of satisfying any external order against the \ndefendant that has been or may be registered under Art 22. \nA.7.632 However the court's powers must be exercised with a view to allowing a person other than \nthe defendant or a recipient of a tainted gift to retain or recover the value of any interest \nheld by him. In the case of realisable property or specified property held by a recipient of a \ntainted gift, the powers must be exercised with a view to realising no more than the value \nfor the time being of the gift. \nA.7.633 An application to discharge or vary a restraint order may be made under Art 9. Arts 10 and \n11 provide a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court against a refusal \nto grant a  restraint order, an order made under Art 8(4), and a  decision made on an \napplication to vary or discharge the order under Art 9(2). Through oversight, the POCA \nOrder was not originally amended by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 so as to \nsubstitute Supreme Court for House of Lords. That was remedied in 20111  and the \nSupreme Court held in \nStart \nrd International Bank Ltd.

There are three principal stages in the enforcement of such an order: \n•  reference to the Director of the appropriate prosecution agency by the Secretary of State; \n•  application by the relevant Director to the Crown Court for the registration of the order; \n•  enforcement of the order by the relevant Director. Art 27 also allows for the appointment \nof an enforcement receiver to manage the property and to realize it in satisfaction of the \nconfiscation order in accordance with Art 28. \nThe first step in the enforcement of an external order following its receipt from a foreign A.7.638 \nstate is  its referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Art 18(1) provides that, except \nwhere Art 18(2) applies (cases of serious and complex fraud), the Secretary of State may \nrefer an external order arising from a criminal conviction in the country from which the \norder was sent and concerning relevant property in England and Wales' to the DPP.2 In a \ncase falling under Art 18(2) the order may be referred to the Director of the SFO.3\nI  BY An \n18(5), \nwhere an \norder concerns relevant property which is in \nScotland or Northern Ireland swell\nas England or Wales. so much of the request as concerns such properly shall be dealt with under Pt 3 or \n4 of the POCA Order \n2005. respectively. \n2 \nPOCA Order.

The request may be ex \nparte to a  judge in chambers and must include a request that the relevant Director be \nappointed as the enforcement authority for the order. \n(I) Conditions forgiving den to an external order \nA.7.640 By Art 21 of the FOCA Order, the Crown Court must decide to give effect to the external \norder by registering it where all of the following conditions are satisfied. \nA.7.641 The first condition is that the external order was made consequent on the conviction of the \nperson named in the order and no appeal is outstanding in respect of that conviction. \nA.7.642 The second condition is that the external order is in force and no appeal is outstanding in \nrespect of it. \nA.7.643 The third condition is that giving effect to the external order would not be incompatible \nwith the Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998) of any \nperson affected by it.' In Government ofthe United States ofAmerica v Montgomery (No 2)2 \nthe House of Lords considered whether the enforcement of an external order would violate \nthe defendants Convention rights. Their Lordships held that it could do so, but only in an \nexceptional case where there would be a flagrant denial of justice3 (which was not the case \non the facts). \n1  Government ofthe United States ofeinterka v Montgomery (No 2)120041 I WLR 2241. \n2  120041 I WLR 2241. para 24. \n3  On the meaning of this phrase see Othmon v United Kingdom (2012) 55 EHRR I. \nA.7.644 The fourth condition applies only in respect of an external order which authorizes the \nconfiscation of property other than money that is specified in the order. In such a case, the \nspecified property must not be subject to a  charge under the legislation specified in \nArt 21(6). \nA.7.645 In determining whether the order is an external order within the meaning of the FOCA the \ncourt must have regard to the definitions in s 447(2), (4), (5), (6), (8), and (10).1\n1  ROCA Order, An 21(7). \nA.7.646 By Art 22, where the Crown Court decides to give effect to an external order it must register \nthe order in that court; provide for the notice of the registration to be given to any person \naffected by it; and appoint the relevant Director as the enforcement authority for the order. \nA.7.647 The Crown Court may cancel the registration of the external order, or vary the property to \nwhich it applies, on an application by the relevant Director or any person affected by it if \nor to the extent that the court is of the opinion that any of the conditions in Art 21 are not \nsatisfied.'

Examples of such \norders that have been granted in domestic restraint cases include: \n•  a disclosure order requiring the defendant to swear an affidavit as to the whereabouts of \nhis assets:2 \n• an order for cross-examination on the defendant's disclosure affidavit, This power \nshould only be used in exceptional circumstances where there are justifiable concerns \nover whether the defendant has given full disclosure of his assets.4 The only legitimate \npurpose of the cross-examination is to establish the extent of a defendant's assets, and \nhence would be unnecessary if sufficient assets are known about to meet the claim :5 \n• an order requiring the defendant to repatriate his assets;6 \n• an order for the delivery up of the defendant's passport.' \nI  Cf POCA 2002, s 41(7). \n2  Re 0 (Dinka:in Order) 119911 2 QB 520.

Mutual Legal Assistance in Relation to Restraint (A.7.712] \nI  See pan £7.620. \nThe procedure for obtaining a restraint order in the Crown Court and for enforcing an A.7.709 \nexternal order is contained in Rule 33.12 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015.1  Rule \n33.12 provides that the rules in Parts 33 and 42 apply with the necessary modifications to \nproceedings under the POCA Order in the same way that they apply to corresponding \nproceedings under Part 2 of POCA.2 Rule 33.12 contains a  useful table showing how \nprovisions of the 2005 Order correspond to provisions of the 2002 Act. \nI  SI 2015/1490, in force 5 \nOctober \n2015. \n2  See T Moloney and D Atkinson, Blarlatone's Guide to the Criminal hortatory Ralf 2010 (2010). \n(x) Remitting confiscated property to the requesting state \nProperty (or its equivalent in money) recovered under a foreign confiscation or forfeiture A.7.710 \norder in the UK is not automatically transmitted to the foreign enforcement authority or \nstate. Property (or its equivalent in money) recovered under a foreign confiscation order is \nplaced in the UK Government's Consolidated Fund.' There is no legal power which enables \nthe UK court to remit the property to a foreign state or other recipient. Forfeited property, \nin England and Wales, is disposed of at the direction of the High Court, which must give \npersons holding any interest in the property in question a 'reasonable opportunity' to make \nrepresentations to the court. \nI  In the someway, where the UK seeks the assistance of a foreign stare in enforcing a domestic confiscation \norder under POCA, s 74, any property recovered in the foreign state falls to be dealt with under that \nstates law and is not automatically remitted to the UK: POCA, s 74(3). \nThe UK has entered into agreements with Canada+ and the US2 to determine the ultimate \ndestination of property or sums of money confiscated (in the UK, as defined by UK law) or \nforfeited (in Canada or the US). These agreements permit the UK to share property (or an \nequivalent amount of money) confiscated in the UK with the requesting state. \nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Canada Regarding \nthe Sharing of Forfeited or Confiscated Assets or their Equivalent Funds. signed in London on 21 \nFebruary 2001. Treaty Series 02812001. CM 5180. The Agreement provides for the sharing of assets \nforfeited in Canada or confiscated in the UK. An exchange of Notes between the United Kingdom and \nCanada Co Extend the Agreement Regarding the Sharing of Forfeited or Confiscated Assets or their \nEquivalent Funds was signed on 21 January 2003. \n2  Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United Sums \nof America Regarding the Sharing of Forfeited or Confiscated Assets or their Equivalent Funds, signed \nin Washington on 31st March 2003 and ratified by the UK on that date. \nA.7.711 \nSome international criminal conventions also contain provisions relating to the return of A.7.712 \nconfiscated property to the requesting state.' \nI  See, eg. Art 57(2) of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption: ehrtp://www.unodc.orglpdf/ \ncrime/convenrion_corruption/signing/Convention-e.pdf>. \nFraud A-7143 \nEFTA00022298\n\n[A.7.713] Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud \nA.7.713 Where there is no such agreement the foreign state must request the remittance of property \nor sums of money on a diplomatic basis. If the requesting state is one which itself would \nremit property or sums of money, which it recovers in its own procedures, this is likely to \ngive rise to a diplomatic expectation of reciprocal remittance from the UK. Where it is the \ncase that remittance is requested by a foreign state on the basis that the property and or \nmoney would, if remitted, be returned to a victim or paid as compensation to a  victim of \ncrime, the request for remittance has more force still. The UK Central Authority deals with \nthese requests and may agree to remit a portion of funds recovered (after itself obtaining the \napproval of the Treasury). MI other funds recovered are paid to the Consolidated Fund and \nare not remitted to other states or persons. \n(d) Foreign requests for assistance in gathering evidence in relation \nto confiscation \n(i) Investigations using powers in the Crime (International Co-operation) Art 2003 \nA.7.714 The methods by which assistance may be provided by the UK to foreign states in relation \nto evidence gathering have been summarized in earlier chapters. These powers are available \nfor use in relation to restraint and confiscation investigations. In summary, the powers \navailable under CICA 2003 and other statutes include: \n•  search and seizure warrants: warrants authorising an appropriate person to enter and \nsearch specified premises and to seize and retain any material found there which is likely \nto be of substantial value to the civil recovery investigation;' \n•  production orders: orders requiring a specified person appearing to be in possession or \ncontrol of material to produce it to an appropriate officer for him to take away, or \nrequiring a specified person to give an appropriate officer access to the material:2\n•  voluntary and compulsory interviews; \n•  proceedings before a nominated court:4\n•  customer information orders: orders requiring financial institutions to provide certain \ninformation in relation to a specified customer of the institution;s \n•  account monitoring orders: orders requiring financial institutions to provide certain \naccount information in relation to an account held by the financial institution.6 \nCICA \n2003. \nis\n 13(0(b). \n16. and 17: CICA 2003. \ns \n15(2): and Criminal Justice Act 1987, s 2(4). \n2   CICA 2003. ss  13(1)(b), 16, and 17: CICA 2003. s  15(2): and Criminal Justice Act 1987, s  2(3). \nS 13(1)(6) in fact refers only to warrants and not orders.

S 445(1) \nprovides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council make provision to enable orders \nequivalent to those under Part 8 to be made, and warrants equivalent to those under Part 8 \nto be issued, for the purposes of an 'external investigation', and make provision creating \noffences in relation to external investigations which are equivalent to offences created by \nPart 8 ands 435B. \nAn 'external investigation is defined in s  447(3) to be an investigation by an overseas A.7.717 \nauthority into whether property has been obtained as  a result of or in connection with \ncriminal conduct; the extent or whereabouts of property obtained as  a  result of or in \nconnection with criminal conduct; or whether a  money laundering offence has been \ncommitted. \nTwo Orders have been made thus far: the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investi- A.7.718 \ngations) Order 20131 (re civil recovery investigations) and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 \n(External Investigations) Order 2014 (other investigations)? Both Orders make provisions \nto assist external investigations by way of orders and warrants from the court. Neither \nOrder encompasses external money laundering investigations) \nI  The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations) Order 2013, SI 2013/2605 (in force I \n1 \nNovember 2013) makes provision to assist an external investigation, within the meaning of s 447(3) of \nPOCA, by obtaining orders and warrants from thecourr.The provisions correspond (subject to specified \nmodifications) to the civil recovery investigation provisions in Pt 8 of POCA. Overseas requests to \ninvestigate that are criminal in nature will continue to be dealt with through the provisions in the CICA \n2003. Article 35 applies the domestic codes of practice that govern POCA. Pt 8 (see SI 2018/84 and SI \n2018/93) to external civil recovery investigations. \n2   The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations) Order 2014. SI 2014/1893 complements SI \n2013/2605 and makes further provision to assist an external investigation, within the meaning of s \n447(3) of POCA, by obtaining orders and warrants from the court.
