SCHWARTZ \nTel.: \nE-mail: \nOctober \n15, 2019 \nI am writing to briefly follow up on our conversation this afternoon. As I told you, I \nrepresent a client who has been in negotiations to purchase a Keystone (Sikorsky) model S-76C \nhelicopter from a U.S. Virgin Islands entity called Hyperion Air, LLC. The agreed-upon purchase \nprice for the aircraft is $3.5 million, with a $100,000 deposit that my client has already paid into \nescrow. The parties are currently negotiating a final purchase agreement, and the seller — who as I \nmentioned is being represented by Darren K. Indyke —  is pushing for a November 15, 2019 closing \nfor the transaction. \nWe have recently come to understand that Hyperion Air, LLC is an entity associated with \nJeffrey Epstein. We therefore wanted to advise your Office of this transaction before it is finalized. \nAlthough my client has no reason to believe that the aircraft may be subject to forfeiture —  it was \nnot identified in the forfeiture language of the charging instruments against Epstein, it was not \nacquired by Hyperion Air until long after the charged conduct, and we have no reason to believe \nthat it was purchased with criminally-derived funds or is otherwise potentially subject to forfeiture \n— we of course wanted to give the Office the opportunity to take any action that it may deem \nappropriate, including blocking the transaction or ensuring that the proceeds are deposited into \nescrow. \nAs we discussed, we look forward to hearing back from the Office. As I mentioned when \nwe spoke, in the absence of guidance from the Office, it is my client's intention to proceed with the \ntransaction. If we do not hear back from you before then, I will check back in before my client \nsigns the purchase agreement. \nRespectfully, \nIs/ Matthew L. Schwartz \nMatthew L.
