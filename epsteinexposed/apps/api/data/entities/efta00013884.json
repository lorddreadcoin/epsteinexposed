I  think says it is two years. The issue is implicated in two ways. First, \nbecause of the state's leniency for the first set of girls, the second set have been presented only to us for prosecution. If we cannot go \nforward, then there will be no prosecution of those crimes. (In response to the argument that in should just present them now, we believe \nthat some of the victims are unknown to the defense and disclosing them further weakens our case by allowing them to depose and harass \nthose victims.) \nSecond, our \"state resolution\" of the case requires epstein to plead to something that hasn't been charged yet so further delay will allow him \nto escape one of the terms of the deal he signed several months ago. (There also is a sol on the private cause of action under 2255 pursuant \nto which he must pay damages to the girls. The delay will allow him to escape responsibility for that term, too.) \nOther reasons: \nThe victims are getting older. Clearly one of epstein's arguments will be that he did not know they were minors. The older they are when \nthey testify the more plausible epstein's argument becomes. \nThe grand jury we are using will expire soon. We have already presented more than a dozen hours of testimony and the grand jury is \ninvested and wants to indict. \nWe promised the girls swift justice so they could move on with their lives. is a perfect example of why this is needed. The delay so \nfar has led many to reach out to private lawyers which, in turn, let's e argue that they are only in it for money. \nWhy give him more time? He has had more than a year's delay already for no reason other than the names of the attorneys he can afford to \nhire. This is not a white collar or other non-violent crime. This is a child exploitation crime with more than 20 known child victims. We are \nmandated by statute and doj policy to prosecute those cases vigorously and in a timely fashion - whether the children were prostitutes or \nunwilling victims. Why is this case being treated so differently? \n---- Original Message ----\nFrom: (FBI) \nTo: .

Apparently the DAG is inclined to allow Epstein's counsel to present further arguments. • \nhas requested and Ito prepare, in email format, arguments to present to the DAG supporting why the case should not be \nstalled any further. mentioned statute of limitation issues. I don't know what the specific statute of limitations are (if there are \nany) for the various counts. Seems like the statute of limitations was for the life of the victim but I'm not certain. Other points that can be \nmade include the private investigators continuing to contact the victims and the relocation of our victims to various parts of the country. \nDo you have any suggestions as to what would be our best course of persuasion?

I hope that his request will be denied. The original deal was \nsupposed to be 2 years so he has already gotten a big break. Plus we have identified more victims since we agreed to the 18 months. Please \nkeep me posted. Thanks. \nEFTA00013885",
