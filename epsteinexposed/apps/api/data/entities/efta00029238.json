(Reuters) \nDate: April 8, 2021 at 9:14:16 AM EDT \nTo: \nSubject: 040721 -- SDNY -- US v Maxwell -- Maxwell letter -- request from Reuters \nHi from New York. Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers have now responded in considerable color to the \ngovernment's letter regarding the conditions at MDC. As you probably know, the DOJ's discussion about \nconditions in Maxwell's cell attracted much press attention. \nLeaving aside the question of whose assessment is more accurate, the defense is raising the question of whether \nthe DOJ should be disclosing such information because of the potential it might contribute to poisoning the jury \npool. (This could be a ground for appeal if Maxwell were convicted.) \nWe would like the government's response to this letter, including its mindfulness about how its disclosures \nmight affect Maxwell's right to a fair trial, and whether it would consent to future redactions of the type \ndescribed in the final paragraph. \nThanks in advance. \n--Jon \nJonathan Stempel \nCorrespondent, Reuters America LLC \nThomson Reuters \nEFTA00029238\n\nThis e-mail is for the sole use of the intended recipient and contains information that may be privileged and/or \nconfidential.
