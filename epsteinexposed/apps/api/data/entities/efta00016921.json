    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nSubject: RE: call from Maxwell attorneys \nDate: Tue, 21 Jan 2020 19:53:36 +0000 \nChris and Mark just called me a few minutes ago, wanting to generally check in and see if we wanted or needed anything \nfrom them. I said that as a general matter, in terms of status, the investigation is ongoing, and that I didn't have any \nadditional information beyond that. On whether we needed anything, I said I would circle up with the team and get them \nan answer on that. Initially my thought was to say no, nothing needed from them right now, but now I wonder, do we \nwant to issue any document subpoenas to GM? Photos, communications, journals, memo pads, financial records \nassociated with Epstein, or anything else ... thoughts?? \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n• ew York \nEFTA00016921",
