See \nattached. You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies \nin the case that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. \nWe filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday — and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA \nviolation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In \npoint (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, \nthe scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It \nappears that Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. \nI wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to \nNew York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra. \nfor Jane Doe 1 and 2 \n(phone) (fax) \nYou can access my publications on \nCONFIDENTIAL: This electronic message - along with any/all attachments is confidential.
