GIUFFRE, \nPlaintiff, \n-against-\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nDefendant. \nNo. \n15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) \nMEMORANDUM & ORDER \nLORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior \nUnited States District Judge: \nThe Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's \nletter \nrequesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision \nto unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and \nDoe l's \ndepositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting \nfrom, quoting \nfrom, or summarizing \nthe contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. \nno. \n1078.) \nMs. Maxwell's \neleventh-hour request for reconsideration is \ndenied. \nAs Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration \nis an \"extraordinary remedy.\" In re Beacon Assocs. Litig.,  818 F. \nSupp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. \nInc. \nSec. Litig.,  113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)).  Such \nmotions \"are properly granted \nonly if there is a showing of: (1) \nan intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of \nnew evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent \nmanifest injustice.\" Drapkin v. \nMafco Consol. Grp., Inc.,  818 F. \nSupp. 2d 678, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). \"A motion for \nreconsideration \n1 \nEFTA00017070\n\nCaCele1B963431734120tArneadditietterinOMOneef \n;WI \n2612,CRINbgeo2 tf 4 \nmay not be  used to advance new facts, issues or arguments not \npreviously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle \nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.\" Bennett v. \nWatson Wyatt & Co.,  156 F. Supp.2d \n270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \nHere, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her \nassertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, \nprovide \ncompelling reasons for keeping the deposition transcripts \nsealed. (See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) But, despite Ms. \nMaxwell's \ncontention that she could not address the effect of those events \nin her objections because they occurred after the close of \nbriefing, (id.), \n1\n  this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original \nobjection to  unsealing, Ms. Maxwell argued that the specter of \nongoing criminal investigations into unknown individuals \nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes \nMs. Maxwell\n--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing \n2  The Court notes as  a  practical matter that Ms. Maxwell \nwas \narrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's \nJuly 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent \nthat they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in \nthe unsealing process, the issues that Ms. \nMaxwell raises in her \nrequest were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. \nMs. Maxwell, \nhowever, did not seek to supplement her objections to \nunsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified \nthe parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing \ndecision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with \nother documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) \nEven then, Ms. \nMaxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. \nMs. Maxwell did not raise her \n\"vastly different position,\" \n(Transcript of July 23 \nRuling at 16:2-3), until moments after the \nCourt had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents. \n2 \nEFTA00017071\n\nCaCele1806341734120LNA e addittitie ria00C2 Med \n'Of \n2/912CRIZjageat tf 4 \nprocess. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, \nspecifically \nMs. Maxwell's concern \nthat unsealing would \n\"inappropriately \ninfluence potential witnesses or alleged victims,\" (id.), and her \nreference to \"publicly reported statements by \nPlaintiff, \nPlaintiff's counsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New \nYork, and the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin \nIslands\" about those investigations, (id.), carried with \nit the \nclear implication \nthat Ms. Maxwell could find herself subject to \ninvestigation \nand, eventually, indictment. The Court understood \nthat \nimplication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already \nconsidered any role that criminal \ncharges against Ms. Maxwell might \nplay in \nrebutting the presumption of public access to the sealed \nmaterials. \nMs. \nMaxwell's request for reconsideration of  the \nCourt's July 23 ruling is accordingly \ndenied. \nGiven the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for \nreconsideration, the Court will stay the \nunsealing of Ms. Maxwell's \nand Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order \nor  paper that quotes from or  discloses information from \nthose \ndeposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through \nFriday, July 31, 2020, so that \nMs. Maxwell may seek relief from \nthe Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from \nor disclose information from those deposition transcripts shall be \nunsealed on July 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's \nOrder dated July 28, 2020.
