(This is in the context of a larger story about his travels to the Middle East.) \nWould any of you be willing to talk to me about this aspect of the case? \nMy working deadline is Friday at noon, Eastern Time, but there is some flexibility if you need more \ntime. I'm happy to hop on the phone, too, if that's more convenient. \nThanks, \nKeenan \nEFTA00024358",
