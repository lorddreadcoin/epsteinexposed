We should have \nconfirm though. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Monday, September 9, 2019 5:26 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Outstanding requests - update \nI think the file \"SHU Training 06-06-19 & Information\" may be the post orders.

They should look like a series of rules and regulations for the post that are \nsigned by each officer. They are different from the daily rosters. And we should ask for the daily rosters for the time \nperiod we are missing. \nWhen you're ready, could you follow up with I= (copying us) on the outstanding items? Thank you. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Monday, September 9, 201910:56 AM \nEFTA00030705\n\nTo: (USANYS) < (USANYS) <> \nSubject: Outstanding requests - update \nI'm working though the outstanding requests, specifically those that we sent last week. \nThe Commissary Reports are in the shared here: \n\\usa.doj.gov\\ clouanys \\StAndrewASharealnReEpsteinDeath-2019R01059 \\ Evidence Epstein General BOP Records \nAdditionally, the records for M, and (no or =) are here as well (in the same document). \nHowever, all they entail is a  single truview page and nothing else. The actual receipts are only for Epstein, M, and \nRuga rd. \nWhat I'm not sure on is the signed SHU post order review sheets. I have looked through the files and can't seem to find \nthem anywhere. Albeit I don't know what they look like but I do think I would have recognized them. I will keep looking. \nLastly, are the post orders for SHU the same as the daily assignment roster? I've attached one of them as an example. If \nso, we are missing several from the time period that we requested (7/1 —  8/10). \nI'm going to continue to work through the spreadsheet as well. \nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSDNY \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nOffice: \nCell: \nEFTA00030706",
