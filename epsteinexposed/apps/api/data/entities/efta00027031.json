Madonna, 17 Cr. 89 (CS). We have also attached proposed redacted disclosures. As you and I discussed, \nwe offer this as a means to ensure our client's safety while permitting the Government to comply with what you \nbelieve are your disclosure obligations. \nAs an alternative, we are willing to apply under seal to Judge Tones for a Protective Order to preclude the \ndisclosure. Our client is not a witness, and so this is not 3500 material, nor is it Rule 16 material. We do not \nbelieve that this is in fact Brady material, but rather is an error made by our client that we understand is \ncontradicted by the surveillance video evidence. While we applaud your efforts, we have an obligation to make \nsure that our client is not harmed by the possible release of the fact that he met with your Office. \nWe understand that you have time constraints. Please let us know how you want to proceed so that we can file a \nmotion before Judge Tones promptly if that is necessary. \nAndy \nAndrew G.
