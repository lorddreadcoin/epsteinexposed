I received a reply a month later from \nMaciej Wenerski who handled it as a FOIA, with the obligatory one month grace before hitting the \nsend button. \nI shall not repeat myself too much here, but the issue is raised in the public domain now, with the FBI, \nFCA and the PRA all investigating Jes Staley's conduct while working at JP Morgan, which ostensibly \nshould disqualify him from holding a sernior position in a bank —  he was never fit to be CEO of \nBarclays. \nClearly according the FOIA responses I received from the TSC, the blackmail emails from Epstein \nshould have been enough to have had Staley dismissed in 2015, and would give substantial context to \nthe emails held by JP Morgan. The TSC has had the Epstein emails now for almost five years —  and \nno MP and no civil servant did the honourable thing and demand the FCA investigate. \nMr Stride, do you take personal responsibility for the TSC witholding key legal evidence to ongoing \ninquiries? Which civil servants in the TSC are involved with the cover-up? Are they expecting a role in \nBarclays after the dust has settled? \nAndrew Bailey of the FCA and Lisa Osofsky of the SFO both explicity refused to investigate Staley \nafter I supplied them with FOIA responses. Did the TSC order the FCA and the SFO to stand down? It \nis only the US press that has forced the British establishment's hand. Had Staley's role in JP Morgan \nnot been reported there would be no investigation. \nI believe the general public would be correct to infer that Epstein not only blackmailed Parliament to \nput Staley into position, but blackmailed it into accepting Bailey and Osofsky. Both would need to be \ncorrupted in order for Staley to keep his job. Why is Bailey being considered for top job at the Bank of \nEngland when the FCA that he runs has a 98% disapproval rating from the general public. \nBailey and the FCA are answerable to the Treasury which is answerable to Parliament. \nIt is noted that Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney are being investigated for the LC&F scandal. \nEFTA00019890\n\nTo remind you, my friend may well have been murdered for exposing the Epstein and \nStaley story back in 2017. The timing of her death and the contents of her exposé were given as \nevidence to Judge Worster of the Birmingham Court. The Court now refuses to accept my emails and \nhe stonewalls me. Worster served two restraining orders against me. The effect of these orders is \npatent —  they blocked the truth about Staley being publicly validated in a legal document and signed \noff by a High Court judge. They also allowed Deutsche Bank to get away with never having to file \nincriminating evidenec against themselves. \nDid Worster take a bribe or was he ordered by the TSC to gag me? I presume if Staley was going to \nbribe a judge to cover up his role in the Epstein paedophile circle, he would have to make sure the \nLord Chief Justice Ian Burnett was in the loop. Lord Etherton seems to have implied Burnett was \nhimself a paedphile. You may have heard about this. I wonder if Burnett was Epstein's pick? Certainly \nsomeone who works with both Lord Adrian PIE Fulford and Paul Kernaghan has to be highly suspect. I \nguess the truth must be in your email system somewhere. \nDid you bother asking the FCA to investigate Roger Jenkins, who also appears to have also gone to \nEpstein's child-rape parties? \nYours sincerely \nMark Anthony Taylor \nOn Sun, 22 Dec 2019 at 14:07, TheAbstraction . \nc \nwrote: \nTo the TSC and my constituency MP Theo Clarke \nPlease find attached a letter to the TSC regarding Epstein's blackmail of Parliament and the \nJudiciary. \nRegards \nMark Anthony Taylor \nMark Anthony Taylor \nEFTA00019891",
