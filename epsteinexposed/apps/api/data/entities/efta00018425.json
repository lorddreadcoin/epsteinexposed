Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises \n1. The premises to be searched (the \"Subject Premises\") are described as a multi-story \nsingle-family residence located at 9 \nEast 71st Street, New York, New York, and include all locked \nand closed containers found therein. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises \nis included below: \nIL Items to Be Seized \nA. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of \nthe Subject Offenses \nThis warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of \nviolations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex \ntrafficking conspiracy) (the \"Subject Offenses\") described as follows: \nThe items to be seized from the Subject Premises are any computer devices and storage \nmedia that may contain any electronically stored information falling within the categories set forth \nin Section B of this Attachment, including, but not limited to, desktop and laptop computers, disk \ndrives, modems, thumb drives, personal digital assistants, smart phones, digital cameras, scanners, \nrouters, modems, and network equipment used to connect to thd Internet. In lieu of seizing any \nsuch computer devices or storage media, this warrant also authorizes, in the alternative, the \ncopying of such devices or media for later review. \nThe items to be seized from the Subject Premises also include: \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00018427\n\n1. Any \nitems or records needed to \naccess the data stored on any \nseized or copied \ncomputer \ndevices or storage media, including \nbut not limited to any physical \nkeys, encryption \ndevices, or records of login \ncredentials, passwords, private \nencryption keys, or similar information. \n2. My items or records \nthat may facilitate a forensic \nexamination of the computer \ndevices or storage \nmedia, including any \nhardware or software manuals or \nother information \nconcerning the \nconfiguration of the seized or \ncopied computer devices or storage \nmedia. \n3. \nAny evidence concerning the identities \nor locations of those persons with \naccess to, \ncontrol over, or ownership of \nthe seized or copied computer \ndevices or storage media. \nB. Search and Seizure of Electronically Stored \nInformation \nAs \nset forth in Section A to this \nattachment, this warrant authorizes \nthe search of the Subject \nPremises for any computer \ndevices and storage media that \nmay contain any electronically \nstored \ninformation \nfalling within the \ncategories set forth below: \n4. \nAny documents or \ncommunications with or regarding victims \nor potential victims \nof the \nSubject \nOffenses; \n5. Any \nphotographs of victims or potential \nvictims of the Subject Offenses; \n6. My nude, \npartially nude, or sexually \nsuggestive photographs of individuals \nwho \nappear to be teenage girls, or younger; \n7. \nRecords or other items \nthat evidence ownership, \ncontrol, or use of, or access to \ndevices, storage \nmedia, and related electronic \nequipment used to \naccess, transmit, or store \ninformation relating to the \nSubject Offenses, including, \nbut not limited to, sales \nreceipts, \nwarranties, bills for Internet \naccess, handwritten notes, registry \nentries, configuration files, \nsaved \nusernames and \npasswords, user profiles, e-mail \ncontacts, and photographs; \n8. \nMy child erotica, defined as \nsuggestive visual depictions of nude \nminors that do \nnot \nconstitute child pornography as \ndefined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). \nC. Review of ESI \nLaw enforcement personnel \n(including, in addition to law \nenforcement officers and agents, \nand depending on \nthe nature of the ESI and the status \nof the investigation and related \nproceedings, \nattorneys for the government, \nattorney support staff, agency personnel \nassisting the government in \nthis investigation, and \noutside technical experts under \ngovernment control) will create a \nforensic \nimage of the Subject \nDevices (if practicable) and review \nthe ESI contained therein for \ninformation \nresponsive to the warrant, that is, for the \nmaterials specified in Section B of this \nAttachment. \nIn \nconducting this review, \nlaw enforcement personnel \nmay use various techniques \nto \ndetermine \nwhich files or other ESI contain \nevidence or fruits of \nthe Subject Offenses. Such \ntechniques may include, for example: \n2 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00018428\n\n• surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to \nlooking at the \noutside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer \nbelieved to \ncontain pertinent files); \n• conducting a file-by-file review by \"opening\" or reading the first few \n\"pages\" of such \nfiles in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory \nexamination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its \nrelevance); \n• \"scanning\" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted \ndata or \ndeliberately \nhidden files; and \n• \nperforming electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to \ndetermine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of \nthe investigation6; and \n• reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry \ndata, and any \nother information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. \n. Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, \ndocuments, or \nother electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section \nILA of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a \ncomplete review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its \ncontents and \nto locate all data responsive to the warrant. \n6  Keyword searches \nalone are typically inadequate to detect all relevant data. For one thing, \nkeyword \nsearches work \nonly for text data, yet many types of files, such as images and videos, do \nnot store data as searchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there may be information properly \nsubject to seizure but that is not captured by a keyword search \nbecause the information does not \ncontain the keywords being searched. \n3 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00018429",
