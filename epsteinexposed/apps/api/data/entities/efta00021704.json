    "text": "\n\nFrom: ' (NY) (FBI)\" \nTo: Mina \"\nr\nlYMFBa\n>\nCc: \nr, \nSubject: New York search warrant materials \nDate: Mon, 30 Sep 2019 19:22:53 +0000 \nSo the short answer is that the load files are not completed yet. One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. The \nlimitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as quickly \nas I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration date, so that \ntook priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load files, but the \nprocess is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK right now. \nSenior Forensic Examiner \ndesk \nOn Sep 30, 2019 3:13 PM, ' \nHey \n(NY) (FBI)\" -.MEM.> \nwrote: \nI've copied here who has handled all of the Epstein evidence that was sent to CART. He should \nbe able to answer your questions regarding what he's processed. \nOn Sep 30, 2019 1:57 PM, <1=1.> \nwrote: \nss \nThe taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer \ndocuments than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, \ncomputers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact \nprocessed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. \nMy understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately \n38 computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021704",
