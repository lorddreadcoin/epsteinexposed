    "text": "\n\nU.S. \nDepartment of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of Florida \nVIA FACSIMILE \nJack A. Goldberger, Esq. \nAtterburv, \noldber er & Weiss, P.A. \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401-5015 \nRoy Black, Esq. \nBlack rebnick Koms an & Stumpf P.A. \nMiami, FL \n33131 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nFacsimile: \nJune 27, 2008 \nDear Messrs. Goldberger and Black: \nI write to follow up on my e-mail correspondence of June 24 and June 26, and my message \nthis morning. As of 3:15 p.m., Friday, June 27, 2008, the Office still has not received a copy of a \nproposed plea agreement between Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office, nor has the Office \nreceived notice of a date and time for a change of plea. \nAs you know, the Non-Prosecution Agreement between Mr. Epstein and the Office called \nfor Mr. Epstein to plead, be sentenced, and begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, \n2008-almost six months ago. The Office has continued that deadline to allow Mr. Epstein to raise \nvarious issues with the Department of Justice, but repeatedly advised that, once those appeals were \ncompleted, Mr. Epstein would need to perform the terms of the agreement within a short window \nthereafter. Now that those appeals have been exhausted, we promptly informed counsel for Mr. \nEpstein that he must enter his plea, be sentenced, and begin serving his sentence by 5:00 on Monday, \nJune 30, 2008. \nThis week I have sent two e-mails and left a message with Mr. Black's receptionist asking \nfor the date and time of the change of plea and for a copy of the proposed plea agreement between \nMr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office in accordance with the terms of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement. I  have received no response to any of those requests. \nEFTA00013910\n\nJACK GOLDBERGER, ESQ. \nRoy BLACK, ESQ. \nJUNE 27, 2008 \nPAGE 2 OF 2 \nI have received correspondence from counsel for a witness asking to cancel or continue the \nwitness's appearance because he \"understand[s] that there has been a  recent development with \nrespect to Mr. Epstein in that he intends to plead guilty in Florida state court on Monday pursuant \nto a deferred prosecution agreement with your office that has already been executed\" and that he has \n\"learned from Mr. Epstein's attorney that the plea is scheduled to take place on Monday morning.\" \nI also understand that there is an entry on Judge McSorley's docket that a hearing is scheduled for \n8:30 a.m. on Monday. \nBoth parties have agreed that it is a material term of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that \nthe United States shall have the right to review the terms of any agreements between Epstein and \nthe State Attorney's Office prior to entering into those agreements. If, indeed, the change of plea \nis set for 8:30 Monday morning, the agreement with the State Attorney's Office must be provided \nto the Office by 4:30 today to allow adequate time to review and comment. Failure to provide this \nopportunity shall be deemed a breach of the Agreement. \nAccordingly, I again ask that you provide me with a copy of the Plea Agreement with the \nState Attorney's Office and notification of the date and time of the change of plea. \nThank you. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States Attorney \ncc: \nEFTA00013911",
