In no particular \norder; \n1. They are refusing to allow us to view the cells and common areas where Nick has been held for nearly 3 years. \nInitially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the staff. We \nare going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd. \n2. I have written multiple emails to asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July \n23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all \n3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be \nhospitalized. We have not been given an update. \n4. We asked for a family visit after next week's court appearance and gave the same reasons we have been \ngiving. This time we were asked for more detail. I sense a change in the mcc approach. My inclination is to ask \nthe judge to help here. \nI was hoping the new administration would improve the conditions while maintaining \nresponsiveness. \nBruce Barket \nBarket, Epstein, Kearon, Aldea & LoTurco \n666 Old Country road \nGarden Cit , NY 11530 \nBarket Epstein.com \nEFTA00016974",
