I asked if her attorney had been in touch \nwith either the prosecutors or the case agents, since we had previously contacted him, and she said she believed he \nhad not been. She said she had been in touch with an NYPD detective but had not heard back in some time. She said \nrepresented her for purposes of the Victim Fund, but was not currently representing her. She provided her \nEFTA00019019\n\ncell phone as.  She did not provide any substantive information on the call, and I did not ask for any. I \nadvised that someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so. The call lasted less than three \nminutes. \nFor context, we were in touch with Mr. several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine \nEpstein victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing \nto speak with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which \nwe couldn't find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached. \nthanks, \nM \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019020",
