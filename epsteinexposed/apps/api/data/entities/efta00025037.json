It should reflect \neverything we discussed on our call earlier today. \nPlease let me know if you have any issues with it as soon as you can. I'd like to file it in the next hour or so. \nThanks, \nChris \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, October 25, 2021 2:29 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell < \n>; \nBOBBI C STERNHEIM < ; Jeff Pagliuca \nCc \nSubject: RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \nHi Chris, \nThat works. I'm around this afternoon —  give me a call at \nThanks, \nLaura Menninger \nwhenever you have a  minute. \nFrom: Christian Everdell \nSent: Monday, October 25, 2021 1:56 PM \nTo: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \n>; \nLaura Menninger \nCc: \nSubject: (EXTERNAL] RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \n>; \nJeff Pagliuca \nI think I have a way to come to an agreement on this. I know today is extremely busy for all of us, but can you and I have a \n5 min. call to discuss? I don't think everyone from SDNY needs to be on this call, but I leave that to you. \nThanks, \nChris \nEFTA00025037\n\nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, October 24, 2021 3:10 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell \nLaura Menninger \n; BOBBI C STERNHEIM ;Jeff Pagliuca \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \nHi Chris, \nI think the answer is yes, but just to make sure: we'd file the Government's proposal on Wednesday, you'd file whatever \nredline you like on November 3. It also occurs to us that, since your redline will presumably contain new \nproposals/objections to ours and would not include our views, we'd want to file a short reply on November 5 or 8. \nWe'd consent to that option and, if you like, would join your motion for that schedule. \nThanks, \nFrom: Christian Everdell \nc \nSent: Sunday, October 24, 2021 12:35 PM \nTo: .=:>; BOBBI C STERNHEIM \n>.; \nLaura Menninger \nCc: \n) <I>; \nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \n(USANYS) \n>; \nJeff Pagliuca \nI just want to clarify the redline option. If we did the redline option, would you file the government's RTC (without \ndefense comment) on Oct. 27 and then we would file the joint RTC (i.e., our redline of your RTCs) on Nov. 3? And you \nwould consent to that option? \nThanks, \nChris \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 22, 2021 2:30 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \nLaura Menninger \n; BOBBI C STERNHEIM .c=; Jeff Pagliuca \nHi Chris, \nWe had another idea that might facilitate things. We know Judge Nathan asked for a joint RTC, but what about asking \nJudge Nathan to let us file separate ones? We would also be comfortable setting a deadline for the defense RTC (or a \ndefense redline of ours) on November 3. \nIf you were to make a request to file separate RTCs, with your deadline on November 3, we would join that request. \nThanks, \nEFTA00025038\n\nFrom: Christian Everdell < \nSent: Wednesday, October 20, 2021 4:07 PM \nTo: >; BOBBI C STERNHEIM \n>; \nLaura \nMenninger \nCc \nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Draft joint proposed request to charge \n•  Jeff Pagliuca \nGiven all of the other things we have going on this week, the defense would like a little more time to submit the joint \nrequests to charge. We plan to ask the Court for an extension until Monday, Nov. 1. Does the government consent to that \nrequest? \nThanks, \nChris \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, October 20, 2021 12:30 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell \nCc \nSubject: Draft joint proposed request to charge \n>; \nLaura \nMenninger \n;  BOBBI C STERNHEIM < >: Jeff Pagliuca \nCounsel, \nAttached please find a draft joint proposed request to charge. Since this is due to the Court on Wednesday, October 27, \nplease send us your comments by Sunday, October 24. Please also send us your comments, including any additional \nproposed jury instructions, as a redline to this document. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00025039",
