The payment by a wealthy individual \nand/or organization offering various teenage girls the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity for sex behind \npageant doors' is surely 'a hidden secret' which has taken place, has it not? \nHad the underage girls not been offered the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' through the guise of a \nbeauty pageant then, cases of -perhaps most likely, lesbian sex between underage girls would not have been \ngiven the time nor, the place for such sex vacations to occur. If such sex vacations occur then, surely it is a form \nof sex trafficking being set into place... into reality by the wealthy individual and/or pageant organization. \nWhile chains, threats, freedom, etc... is perhaps not a form of physical sex trafficking to which often times \nassociated with sex trafficking, if sex -especially underage sex of any manner at beauty pageant gatherings, \noccurs then, this sex trafficking has occurred. \nHas anyone ever questioned past teen beauty contestants as to how many of them were sexually involved -\neither with those 18+ and/or -18... with either those within and/or around the pageants... with male or female, \nduring pageant gatherings? \nEFTA00024265\n\nIf indeed any form of sexual involvement occurred then, in fact, sex trafficking occurred under the guise of \n'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' presented by the beauty pageant owners. A grooming for the world of \nhigh-dollar prostitution is what many can potentially perceive beauty pageants and modeling shows to be. \nNOTE: Obviously, wording of beauty pageants can also be replaced with modeling shows. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVri5KhzFcM \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8czVPrRkWk \nMiss Teen beauty pageants have been places of 'underage grooming.' \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-grooming.html\nIn order to help ensure Ghislaine Maxwell's day in court -not only for her and her lawyers to defend herself \nthrough the legal system, too potentially expose corrupt sex traffickers and, perhaps at this point, to expose the \nactive participants within the deceased Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking saga. Those active participants might very \nwell be high-ranking wealthy politicians and government officials and, socialites typically associated with \nHollywood and the wealthy circles throughout America and, the world. \nGhislaine Maxwell's health and well-being should be extremely important to all women -young and old, in \norder to help ensure injustice is not a  continuous practice as in the past while justice is upheld even against \nthose who have thus far been shielded due to political power and/or wealth. \nSuch is the reason bail should be granted to Ghislaine Maxwell in order to help ensure her appearance before \nthe Court and, before the Nation does not end prior in such an ill-manner of injustice to which befall upon \nJeffrey Epstein to which many question the government's ruling of death based upon questioning any cover-up \nby those in positions of power. \nHaving an individual alive for justice to be rendered -guilty or innocent within a Court of Law, is a far more \ndemanding form of Law than having an individual confined behind bars -with a great risk of death for silence, \nuntil their day in court... perhaps eventually for the political elite if Ghislaine Maxwell is alive and well while \nfinally accepting, her voice must be spoken in truth and honesty... including a forthrightness even at this point \nin time in order to prevent the freedom of those within political power and wealthy socialite houses to continue \nabusing their positions of power based upon wealth against young girls and, young women of all ages. \nAgain, I petition America and, the Courts of Manhattan to grant Ghislaine Maxwell bail for the security of her \nvoice... hopefully her forthright voice to be heard in court. \nPlenty of stories have been revealed around media and former contestants, Donny Trump had employees \nattempting to groom underage girls for him during Miss Teen USA pageants... as have Donny Trump and Billy \nClinton connections with Epstein and Maxwell. \nFrom: Gregor Hirsch \n<AliasAlA@hotmail.com>\nSent: Tuesday, December 15, 2020 2:14 AM \nTo: info@starrandstarccom \n<info@starrandstarr.com>•\n Press@rttv.ru <Press@rttv.ru>•\n info@rttv.ru <info@ rttv.ru>. \ntipi@nypost.com <tipinypost.corn>;
