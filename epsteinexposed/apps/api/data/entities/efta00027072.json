The data from those devices has been subject to a \nprivilege review, based on privileges asserted by Jeffrey Epstein's estate. Because the estate has \nnot waived any of those privileges, the Prosecution Team in this case will not have access to any \nmaterials from those devices identified as privileged by the taint review team, and the Government \nwill not produce any such privileged material to the defense in this case. \nFurther, it is the Government's current understanding that none of the seized devices \nbelonged to the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, and as a result, it is the Government's \nunderstanding that the Prosecution Team is not legally permitted to provide you with the full set \nof non-privileged materials that were extracted from the devices. Instead, the Government \nanticipates producing only the materials designated responsive to the relevant warrants authorizing \nthe search of these devices. Correspondingly, upon completion of the responsiveness review, the \nProsecution Team will only have access to that same set of non-privileged materials deemed \nresponsive to the relevant warrants. The Government expects to produce these responsive, non-\nprivileged materials to you by the November 9, 2020 deadline for completion of discovery. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00027073\n\nPage 3 \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nThe Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly \nproduce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate \nto reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if you wish to arrange a time to \nreview physical items in the FBI's custody. \nVery \ntruly yours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nActing United States Attorney \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00027074",
