Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \nUSDC SONY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY \nFILED \nDOC 0: \nDATE FILED: \n5/3/21 \nApril 30, 2021 \n9D OltOUID. \nALIION I. mama I \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nSOO \nThad \nAvenue \nNew Yolk. NY \n10022 \n♦1 212 \n957 \n7600 phono \nwww \ncohongartav corn \nCounsel for the MDC may \nsubmit any objection to \nthe Defendant's request by \nMay 4, 2021. \nSO \nORDERED. \nWe write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to \naccept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in \nthis case for Ms. Maxwell's use at the MDC. \nIn an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell's review of the discovery, defense counsel have \ncreated a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by \nthe government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is \nnot permitted to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master \ndrives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one \nplace and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November 18, \n2020 production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which \ncontains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and \nother formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and \neliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her \nreview. \nDefense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the \nMDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permitted to accept \nhard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have conferred with \nthe government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to \nthe Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government \nrequested, however, that the Court allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their \nobjections to the Court. \nEFTA00022514\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 260 Filed 04/30/21 Page 2 of 2 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nApril 30, 2021 \nPage 2 \nAccordingly, we respectfully request that the Court issue an order directing the MDC to \naccept the master hard drives either from defense counsel or from the government. We will send a \ncopy of this letter to the MDC Legal Department so that they can note any objections they may \nhave. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. \nSincerely, \n/s/ Christian Everdell \nCOHEN \n& GRESSER LLP \ncc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF) \nMDC Legal Department \nEFTA00022515",
