I asked the Court \n(EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly \nthat there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. \nSo, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from \nour firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make \nanother request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than \naddress the Curcio issue. \nThank you. \nBruce A.
