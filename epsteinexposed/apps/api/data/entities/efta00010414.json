Evcrdcll \nJuly \n2, 2021 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley \nSquare \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nWe respectfully submit this letter to bring to the Court's attention the recent decision by \nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby \nJr., J-100-2020 (Jun. 30, 2021), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby's conviction and sentence \nbecause the District Attorney's Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise \nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.' Ms. Maxwell's \ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently \npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to \nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (\"NPA\"). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms. \nMaxwell's supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment \nfor violation of the NPA. \nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence \nin January 2004. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law \nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the following months. \n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2005, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr. \nCosby's conduct to the police. (Id. at 6). The Montgomery County District Attorney's Office \ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Attorney Bruce Castor determined that \"there was \ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence\" to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (Id. at \n7-10). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (i) Ms. Constand had \nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand's \nrecollections; (ii) Ms. Constand's statements about the events were inconsistent; (iii) there was a \nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby \nI The opinion (\"Op.\") is attached to this letter as Exhibit A. \nEFTA00010414\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 310 Filed 07/02/21 Page 2 of 3 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nJuly \n2, 2021 \nPage 2 \nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil attorneys to pursue financial \ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (Id. at 9-10). \nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he \nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby's lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never \nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (Id. at 10-13, 16-18). Believing that he no \nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions \nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (Id. at 13-\n15). Ten years later, the successor District Attorney, Risa Veil Ferman, used those admissions to \ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were \ncovered by \nDA Castor's promise. (Id. at 18). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial. \n(Id. at 38). \nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor's promise was enforceable and that \nDA Ferman's prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due \nProcess rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby's conviction. (Id. at 79). \nIn so holding, the Court noted the following: \nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including \ncircumstances where the latter seeks enforcement of some promise or \nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due \nprocess and fundamental fairness. \n(Id. at 55). \nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell's case. As in Cosby, the government is trying \nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same \noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more \nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell's case because the NPA was a formal written agreement, as opposed to \nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental \nfairness. \nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the \nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss \nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment. \nEFTA00010415\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 310 Filed 07/02/21 Page 3 of 3 \nThe Honorable Alison J.
