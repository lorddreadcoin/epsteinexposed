Pagliuca \nLaura A. Menninger \nHADDON, MORGAN & FOREMAN P.C. \nChristian R. Everdell \nCOHEN \n& GRESSER LLP \nBobbi C. Stemheim \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C. Stemheim \nAttorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell \nEFTA00028974\n\nThe government continues to stonewall Ms. Maxwell's requests for clarity about what it \nclaims she did to justify her continued incarceration and prosecution. Although the government \nhas dumped thousands of pages of irrelevant discovery from inapplicable time periods on Ms. \nMaxwell and her counsel, it refuses to provide the most basic information about the allegations \nin Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and how. Because Counts One through Four of \nthe superseding indictment (\"Indictment\") lack the basic factual information necessary for Ms. \nMaxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful \ndiscovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms. \nMaxwell's requests for particularity. \nI. The Indictment Lacks the \nNecessary Specificity \nThe government attempts to justify some of the Indictment's deficiencies, e.g., lack of \nnames and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases. \n\"First,\" the government offers United States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir. \n2013), for the proposition that \"the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged \nconduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment.\" Resp. at 153. The government fails to \npoint out, however, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have \noccurred over a 7-month period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of \nthe alleged crime, and the identity of the two people whose names were used in connection with \nthe fraud \"had been revealed in the documents disclosed by the government a year\" before trial. \nId. at 123. \nUnited States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), is equally \nunpersuasive. Kidd was indicted in 2018 for crimes alleged to have occurred as late as 2018. \nThe case involved two alleged victims and the government produced sufficient discovery to \nobviate the need for a bill of particulars. Id. at 368, 370. \n1 \nEFTA00028975\n\nThe Indictment against Ms. Maxwell registers a 98 on the opacity chart. Instead of two \nalleged \"victims,\" the indictment here has different categories with three people being identified \nas \"Minor Victims,\" even though they are not minors. Additionally, an unknown number of \nunexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: \"multiple minor \ngirls,\" \"victims,\" \"minor victims,\" \"minor victims described herein,\" \"some of Epstein's minor \nvictims,\" and \"multiple minor victims.\" It is a mystery if the government claims that these \nalleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple \"among other \nthing\" and \"means and methods\" alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as: \nassisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc. \nThis Indictment is subject to considerable interpretation and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell cannot \nprepare a defense without knowing who her accusers are and whether they are limited to the \nalleged \"Minor Victims\" or the rest of the universe. \n\"Second,\" the government relies on the general proposition that \"Courts in the Second \nCircuit have consistently upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific \ndate.\" Resp. at 154. Again, the cited cases are easily distinguishable. Kidd involved a date range \nending in the year of indictment. Moreover, the quoted general language from Kidd, 386 F. Supp. \n3d 364, 369, is incomplete. The court in Kidd explains the range it is referring to by the \nfollowing reference: \"See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987) \n(holding that 'on or about June 1984' put a defendant on notice for potential crimes in July or \nearly August of 1984 'because the [G]ovemment is not required to prove the exact date, if a date \nreasonably near is established').\" Id. The government fails to include this language because it is \ninapposite to the suggestion that there is anything \"routine\" about a date range beginning 27 \n2 \nEFTA00028976\n\nyears ago that may be applicable to dozens of people in multiple places including a foreign \ncountry. \nUnited States v. Vickers, No. 13-CR-128-A, 2014 WL 1838255, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, \n2014), also does not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment in 2013. It \nis patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements from the alleged victim \ndetailing the allegation had been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the \nlengthy recitation of facts in the opinion \"are taken from the allegations set forth in the Affidavit \nof Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent submitted in support of the \nMay 16, 2013 Criminal Complaint (Dkt.# 1), the Indictment (Dkt.# 8), and the government's \nresponse to the instant motions (Dkt.# 20).\" 2014 WL 1838255, at *3 n.1. The dates and times \nof the alleged conduct would have been fairly easy to identify given the detail provided in \ndiscovery. Here, Ms. Maxwell has not been provided with any relevant statements by the \ngovernment or its witnesses. \nThe government's attempt to hide behind the general proposition that children cannot be \nexpected to remember dates also fails. Resp. at 155. The alleged victims here are not children, \nthey are adults. Moreover, a review of the case relied on by the government, United States v. \nYoung, No. 08-CR-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008), demonstrates \nthe proper way to charge these types of allegations (which is not as the government did here): \nCount One alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fourteen at \nthe time, during the daytime on a  Saturday in or about the Fall of 2006; Count \nTwo alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fifteen at the time, \nduring the daytime on a  Saturday in or about September 2007; and Count Three \nalleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim Two, aged sixteen at the time, on \nan evening in or about the Summer of 2006. Stated differently, the three counts \neach specify a particular time of day (daytime or evening), and feature variances \nin date ranges stretching from roughly four days in Count Two to thirteen days in \nCount One to four months in Count Three. \n3 \nEFTA00028977\n\nThus, the court found: the indictment \"contains dates ranges for each count, stretching from \napproximately four days to four months. These date ranges are well within the boundaries \npermitted by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with \nadditional details provided by the Government Id., at *4 (emphasis added). \nTo date, the only time the government has \"supplemented\" any information about the \naccusations is when it is attempting to excuse some failure. \nHere, the accusers have given statements to the government. Accuser-1 gave a statement \nto the government in 2006. All three accusers have made claims against the Epstein Estate. \nPresumably, the Accusers had to tell the Estate when and where any alleged abuse by Epstein \noccurred. Accordingly, this is not a situation where children do not remember things. This is a \nsituation where the government has refused to provide basic necessary information in an attempt \nto prejudice Ms. Maxwell's defense. \n\"Third,\" the indictment is not \"clear\" (Resp. at 155); it was purposely drafted to \nmaximize charges and minimize clarity. For example, the photograph of Ms. Maxwell in the \nindictment is not from the time-period alleged. The pictures of the various properties were not \nincluded for specificity, they were included to maximize pretrial prejudice. The indictment is \nfull of \"weasel words\" which are words the meaning of which are \"malleable to a point where \nthey mean what the user wants them to mean in any given situation; they have no meaning of \ntheir own.\" Abstrax, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. 2:14-CV-158-JRG, 2014 WL 5677834, at \n*2 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2014). For example: \"up to and including at least in or about,\" \n\"contributed,\" \"among other things,\" \"for example in some instances,\" \"certain victims,\" and \n\"groomed and/or abused at multiple locations including the following.\" Ms. Maxwell is at a loss \nto understand what she is charged with and when it is alleged to have happened. She can guess at \n4 \nEFTA00028978\n\nnames, but given the government's recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to \nattempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-\na-mole with this Indictment. \nIL This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements \nIn Hamling v.  United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974), the United States Supreme \nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply setting forth the offense in the \nwords of the statute may not suffice: \nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the \nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the \ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an \nacquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It  is \ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the \nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, \nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to \nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the \nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be \naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform \nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with \nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up). \nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that \"directly,\" \"expressly,\" and \"without \nuncertainty or ambiguity\" sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and \nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot \nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \nCONCLUSION \nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information \nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any \nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to \nanswer Ms. Maxwell's requests for particularity. \n5 \nEFTA00028979\n\nDated: March 15, 2021 \nRespectfully submitted, \ns/ Jeffrey \nS.
