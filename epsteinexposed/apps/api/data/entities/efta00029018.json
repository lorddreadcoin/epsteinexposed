Obviously this is the first we've heard of it, and understandable that there \nwouldn't be cross-communication since the criminal investigation is still covert (and not widely known even among \nassistants), but it still is a little puzzling in terms of why such a review would be venued here. Do you who the right \nperson would be in civil to ask about FOIA processes there? We're happy to reach out if that's appropriate, or if you \nprefer to do it at the supervisor level certainly no objection from us. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nict of New York \nEFTA00029018",
