I think we had discussed that \nEFTA00026530\n\nthe most efficient step, in the first instance, would be for us to receive digital photos of those physical photographs, to \nwhatever extent they exist, but that doing so was not immediately possible at the time of our conversation in late \nFebruary due to the estate's then-inability to retain or engage anyone to do that. \nIn the first instance, please let me know if I am getting any of that wrong, and second, understanding that the \ncircumstances of the pandemic may have affected this in the interim, we've been asked to again check with you about \nwhether there is anyone currently working at (or reasonably able to go to) those properties who could convey \nphotographs of any physical photos at those locations? If you could please let us know any sense of possibility / timing on \nthat last outstanding request. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThis email communication is confidential and is intended only for the individual(s) or entity named above and \nothers who have been specifically authorized to receive it.
