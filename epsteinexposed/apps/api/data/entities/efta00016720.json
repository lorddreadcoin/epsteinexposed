Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, NY 10007 \nISO East 10th Avenue \nDenver. Colorado 80203 \nwww.hmflaw.com \nRe: Deadline for Filing Motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, \nUnited States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan, \nI write to confirm that November 15, 2021 is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a \nmotion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an \nalleged victim's sexual behavior. \nUnder this Court's pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October 18. A \nmotion in limine is a \"pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or \noffered at trial.\" Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). \nA motion under Rule 412 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking \npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive \nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and \ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under \nits terms-14 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(B) (providing that a defendant must file \nher motion \"at least 14 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time\"). \nEFTA00016720\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 345 Filed 10/14/21 Page 2 of 3 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2021 \nPage 2 \nMs. Maxwell's counsel conferred with the government about the timing for filing a \nmotion under Rule 412. The government seeks to have the motion briefed before jury selection \nbegins. \nImplicit in the language of Rule 412(c)(1)(B) is authority for the Court to permit a \ndefendant to file a motion closer to trial than 14 days, for good cause. But contrary to the \ngovernment's suggestion, the Rule does not contemplate a deadline more than 14 days before \ntrial.' \nIn any event, Ms. Maxwell should not be required to file her Rule 412 motion any time \nbefore November 15, since it was just three days ago (October 11) that the government disclosed \nits 3500 material, including more than 8,000 pages of testifying witness disclosures. It will \nrequire significant time and resources to review and investigate this material and to identify any \npotentially admissible Rule 412 evidence. \nIt was also just three days ago that the government alerted defense counsel to its \nanticipated Rule 404(b) witnesses. Rule 412's procedures apply not just to alleged victims named \nin the indictment but to any alleged victim in a case involving sexual misconduct, including \nalleged 404(b) victims. Fed. R. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes, 1994 Amendments \n(\"Rule 412 extends to `pattern' witnesses in both criminal and civil cases about other instances \nof sexual misconduct by the person accused is otherwise admissible.\"). \nFinally, Ms. Maxwell (who is in custody) was only provided a copy of the government's \ndisclosures earlier today in the late morning. Until Ms. Maxwell is able to review the material, \nSee Fed. R. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes, 1994 Amendments, Subdivision (c) \n(\"The requirement of a motion before trial is continued in the amended rule, as is the provision \nthat a late motion may be permitted for good cause shown.\" (emphasis added)). \nEFTA00016721\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 345 Filed 10/14/21 Page 3 of 3 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2021 \nPage 3 \nher counsel cannot adequately consult with her about the defense. Allowing Ms. Maxwell to file \nher Rule 412 motion 14 days before trial, as the Rule itself provides, is essential for counsel to \neffectively consult with Ms. Maxwell, to investigate and research what evidence they will seek to \nadmit under Rule 412, as well as to comply with the several procedural steps required by the \nRule. \nAccordingly, unless this Court orders otherwise, Ms. Maxwell will file her Rule 412 \nmotion on or before November 15, 2021, as provided in Rule 412(c)(1)(B). \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nCC: Counsel of Record (via ECF) \nEFTA00016722",
