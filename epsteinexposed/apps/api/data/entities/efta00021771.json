Would it be possible to get a hard drive of all of the returns you've received for the \nEpstein case? I know you've given me them on discs, but we were hoping to get them all on one drive to make \nsure we have a complete set in one place. \nNot sure if you're in the office, but I will be this week. No worries if you need some time to get it to us. We can \nalso get you a hard drive if necessary. \nThanks, \nParalegal Specialist \nEFTA00021771\n\nUnited \nStates Attorney's Office \nSouthern District \nof New York \nOffice: \nCell: \nEFTA00021772",
