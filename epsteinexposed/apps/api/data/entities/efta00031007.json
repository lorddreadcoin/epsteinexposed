Such as \nspecific recording of phone calls made, reporting to the SDNY of when phone calls were made, to whom, discussion \ntopics, observing or monitoring phone calls, writing memorandums of what they BOP staff may of heard. \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOffice of the Inspector General \nNew York Field Office \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 11:28 AM \nTo: \n• (OIG) \nCc: (USANYS) •rz> \nSubject: Re: Question from HQ \nDoes \"memorialize Epstein's phone calls\" mean was SDNY required to keep its own log of Epstein's calls at MCC? \nOn Aug 17, 2019, at 10:01 AM, .
