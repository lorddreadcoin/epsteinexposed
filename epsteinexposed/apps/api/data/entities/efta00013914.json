First, the Division of Corporations' documents show that the Florida Science Foundation was \nincorporated in November 2007, not a \"couple of years ago\" as reported by Mr. Epstein. The address provided \nfor the \"office\" of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger's office suite, and neither the office \nbuilding directory nor the office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security \nguard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned knows of the existence of such a business. And, of course, \nMr. Epstein could not have been working there \"every day\" when he hasn't been in Palm Beach County in the \npast six months. \nWe will leave it to your discretion as to whether this should be brought to the Court's attention. \n<<Epstein Agrml001.pdf>> \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax 561 820-8777 \nEFTA00013914",
