First, this goes beyond what we said we would do or told the court we would do. Second, \nin any event they are separately gathering any potentially relevant emails from the a  ent with victims. Third, we \nhave no reason to believe there were significant gaps in retention or collection for such that any of his \nemails would be in what we already have. \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: ase\nDate: October 9  2020 at 9:05:09 PM EDT \nTo: \n(USANYS)\" \n•ta (USANYS)\" \nCc: ' (USANYS)\" a>, \nSubject: Question re \nmails \nChiefs, \nToday, we spoke with a one of the original FBI agents from the Florida investigation of Epstein. \ntold us he has a number of emails with AUSft regarding the case. Our view is that we do not need to collect \nthose emails fromM because we have already received thousands of emails, which were collected by OPR \nand should encompass any emails with the FBI about the Epstein case. is going to send us any emails he received \nfrom victims or witnesses. We also discussed other documents has in his possession from the Epstein \ninvestigation and asked him to send us any that sounded potentially discoverable. \nPlease let us know if this approach sounds right to you or if you would like to discuss. \nThanks, \nEFTA00029490",
