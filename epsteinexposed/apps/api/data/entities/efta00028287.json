We haven't gotten any feedback from individual victims or counsel (either directly or through the agents) \nso I'm just curious who else the victims would be talking to that it would get back to particularly if any of the info \nis substantive in any way. Thanks! \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 17, 2019 18:13 \nTo: \nSubject: Fwd: Epstein victim meeting \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: ' \nDate: October 17, 2019 at 6:01:25 PM EDT \nTo: \nSubject: Epstein victim meeting \nGuys, \nContinue to hear positive comments coming from attendees of the meeting in Florida.
