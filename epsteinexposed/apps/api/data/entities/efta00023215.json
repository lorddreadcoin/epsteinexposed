Everdell \n+1 \n(.212) 957-76M \nceverdellt.,Pcohcngresser.com \nOctober 14, 2021 \nBY CERTIFIED MAIL AND EMAIL \nMr. Scott Falk \nOffice of \nChief Counsel \nU.S. Customs \nand Border Protection \n1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, Suite 4.4-B \nWashington, D.C. 20229 \nCBP-Service-Intake@cbp.dhs.gov \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AM) \nDear Mr. Falk: \n803 \nTh\nud Avenue \nNa.. York. NY 10022 \n+1 212 957 \n7030 phone \n‘ymecohen gresser.com \nWe represent the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the above-referenced matter. This \nletter constitutes a request made pursuant to United States a. rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 \n(1951) and 6 C.F.R. § 5.43(a)(1) for the production of documents in the \npossession of the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection at the trial in this case on November 29, 2019 at 9:00 A.M., \nbefore the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge. The requested documents \nare set forth in the attached subpoena. \nIn accordance with 6 C.F.R. § 5.45(a), we make the following statement setting forth \"the \nnature and relevance\" of the information we seek: \nOn March 29, 2021, Ghislaine Maxwell was charged in a superseding indictment \nwith the following offenses: (1) Count One: conspiracy to entice minors to travel \nto engage in illegal sex acts, (2) Count Two: enticement of a  minor to travel to \nengage in illegal sex acts, (3) Count Three: conspiracy to transport minors with \nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity, (4) Count Four: transportation of a \nminor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, (5) Count Five: sex \ntrafficking conspiracy, and (6) Count Six: sex trafficking of a minor. The charges \nrelate to an alleged scheme between Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein to sexually \nabuse underaged girls from in or about 1994 to in or about 2004. \nThe three individuals listed in the attached subpoena are identified in the \nsuperseding indictment as \"Minor Victim I,\" \"Minor Victim 2,\" and \"Minor \nVictim 3.\" All three individuals are expected to testify for the government at trial. \nAll three of the witnesses traveled internationally during the time period covered \nby the attached subpoena, and some have alleged that they traveled at the request \nEFTA00023215\n\nU.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection \nOctober 14, 2021 \nPage 2 \nof, or with the assistance of, Jeffrey Epstein. Because the crimes alleged require \ninterstate or foreign travel, the border crossing records for these individuals will \nbe directly relevant at trial. \nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please do not hesitate to \ncontact me. \nSincerely, \n/s/ Christian R. Everdell \nChristian R. Everdell \nCOHEN \n& GRESSER LLP \n800 Third Avenue, 21st Floor \nNew York, New York 10022 \n(212) 957-7600 \nEFTA00023216",
