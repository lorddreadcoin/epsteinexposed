(See pp. 25, et seq.) \nThis case is outside our Circuit, involved some unusual facts —  including, arguably, actual deception of the victims, rather \nthan mere failure to notify —  and it does not order a remedy. \nThat said, it is a case of some notoriety (Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking and sexual abuse of minors), so it is getting press \nattention and is likely to be on the minds of our judges. Please be mindful of the CVRA as you negotiate pleas, and talk to \nyour supervisors about whether, how and when to inform victims. They don't get to determine how we dispose of cases, \nbut they're generally entitled to notice. \nThanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nDeputy Chief, Criminal Division \nEastern District of New York \nBrooklyn, NY 11201 \nEFTA00029443",
