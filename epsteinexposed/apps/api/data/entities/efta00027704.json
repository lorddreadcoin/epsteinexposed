    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThe SiAdol Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nOctober 18, 2021 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits its motions in limine, which the Government is \nsubmitting to the Court under seal by email with proposed redactions. The Government's proposed \nredactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. \nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government's motions in \nlimine are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed \nredactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims—including victims who \nhave not identified themselves on the record in this case and who have not publicly identified \nthemselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in this case—and third parties referenced in the \ndocument. \nIn addition, the Government seeks redaction of Section X at least until the conclusion of \ntrial. Additional justification for this sealing request is located in footnote 11 on page 49 of the \nGovernment's motions in limine. \nEFTA00027704\n\nPage 2 \nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court permit the Government \nto publicly file its motions in limine with its proposed redactions. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  \ns/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nCc: Defense counsel \n(By ECF) \nEFTA00027705",
