I think from our perspective the next step would be to have a conversation with \nMs.= directly, and to cover with her the same topics that we've addressed with you. Ordinarily we would \napproach a discussion like that simply by going chronologically, and asking follow-up questions as appropriate along \nthe way, but as I've mentioned to you previously, if it would be useful to proceed in a different format, or to focus \n(or avoid) specific topics in a first meeting, I think we would generally be amenable to that. And of course as we've \nalso discussed, any discussion would be completely voluntary—not just the interview overall, but any specific topic \nor question that she wanted to pass on, or discuss with you in the moment, etc., would be totally up to her. Please \nlet us know what you think? We're also happy to chat via phone if that would be helpful as well. \ntil\nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, Februa 22 2020 21:59 \nTo: Michael Bachner < \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Attorney Proffer \nMichael, \nReceived, thank you.

I apologize if you addressed that and I missed it, but we wanted to add it to the list of \nadditional questions —  in particular, whether she ever visited the New Mexico ranch, the Little St. James Island, \nthe Great St. James island, and/or the Paris residence. Also, is it correct that she just visited the Palm Beach \nresidence the one time you referenced? It's not a problem or issue if she visited any of those other locations, we \njust wanted to clarify one way or the other. And happy to discuss via phone if that's useful. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, Februa \nTo: Michael Bachne \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Attorney \nProffer \n13, 2020 13:40 \nMichael, \nWe do understand that your attorney proffer today will be preliminary, and to the best of your client's current \nrecollection and to the best of your current understanding, and without, e.g., having been provided documents or \nother materials by the Government. \nWe also confirm that your statements will be considered to be made pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 11(f), and therefore under those protections. Regarding Rule 408, we'll just note what we have for other \ncounsel in this case and others who have made similar statements or submissions, which is that we don't take any \nposition on the effect or application of Rule 408 in a prospective or hypothetical dispute in civil litigation, because \nit doesn't implicate any rights the Government would or would not have, but you can consider us advised that \nyour position is that your statements are also covered under 408. (While our Office itself can't guarantee the \nprotections of Rule 408 because any dispute on that issue would be beyond our purview, we are also not taking \nthe position that we believe it does not apply.) \nthank you \nFrom: Michael Bachner \n<r \nSent: Thursday, February 13, 2020 10:08 \nTo: \nSubject: I= Attorney Proffer \nHi Alex: \nPrior to our meeting today, I am writing to confirm that statements I  make to you today \nare preliminary and subject to further refinement once Ms. =and I   have the benefit of additional \ndocument review and refreshed recollection if necessary based upon input we may receive from your \noffice.
