I just wanted to follow up with you both, as I hadn't received an answer from yet and \nwanted to make sure the drives (below) were dealt with today if they're time-sensitive. I received both drives today in the \nmail from PAE, and both appear to contain the same materials. Do they need to be copied or sent out? \nThank you! \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Friday, November 13, 2020 12:35 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: US v.

Parts 1— 3 have been \nexported from Relativity. The vendor will start the stamping of part 6 of the production shortly. \nThe vendor has also been able to load the data for the USAO-SDFL files into the other Epstein database: \nPlease review and let me know if there are any questions. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, November 4, 2020 7:01 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] <a.

Looking on Relativity, it appears that part 4 is at least stamped now, which puts us more \nthan halfway through the stamping. We are planning to ask Judge Nathan for an extension, but given how quickly the \nstamping and export appeared to go today, I am hopeful that this may be ready sooner than the November 19th date \nwe've been discussing. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor) \nSent: Wednesday, November 4, 2020 11:54 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \n'c›; \n(USANYS) [Contractor] < \n(USANYS) [Contractor] <I> \nSubject: US v.

As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1— 3 and is \nabout to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is \ncurrently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and \nthe export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches: \nIf there are any questions please let me know. \nThank you. \nEFTA00014381",
