It  just seems to me that points (3) \nand (4) are so obviously uncontested, that \nyour office would be willing to stipulate to \nthem and make \nthose facts \navailable to \nthe Court for \nconsideration. \nIt  is unclear from \nyour recent letter whether you intend to give the victims the \ncourtesy of seeing the \nfiill \nand complete non-prosecution agreement that was signed by \nthe \nparties and that now \ncovers their \ncase. Your \nprevious proposed stipulation of \nundisputed facts stated: \"On July 9, \n2008, AUSA sent a victim \nnotification to \nJane Doe #1 via her \nattorney, Bradley Edwards, which is  attached as Exhibit 6  to the \nDeclaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full terms \nof the \nagreement \nbetween Epstein \nand the \nU.S. Attorney's \nOffice.\" \nWhile it appears by \nthis \nstatement to have \nbeen \nyour intent to provide \nthe \nvictims with a  true \nand accurate \ncopy of that non\n-prosecution agreement, that agreement has not \nyet been produced to \nthem. \nWhile it is likely a  mere oversight on \nyour part, we would \nagain request a true and \naccurate copy of the complete non\n-prosecution agreement that \napparently bars federal \nprosecution of \nthe man who committed sexual \ncrimes against my clients. \nAdditionally, we \nwould request again that if statements of my clients were taken \nby FBI \nagents or your office, that \nthose \ninterview \nreports \ncontaining those statements he \nproduced to \nus. Finally, I  continue to request that \nyou assist the victims \nin this case by \nsecuring a \ntranscript of the \nhearing on their \npetition. Your \nletter did \nnot address that \nrequest, and we \nwould \nhope \nthat your office would \nassist the innocent \nand \nindigent \nvictims in this ease by providing that transcript. \nThank you \nfor your attention to these concerns. \nSincerely, \nBE/sg \nBrad \nEdwards \nHOLLYWOOD, \nFLORIDA 330 20 \nEFTA00014126",
