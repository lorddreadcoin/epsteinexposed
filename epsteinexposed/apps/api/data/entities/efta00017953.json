    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, New Yor* 10601 \nJanuary 9, 2020 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Kenneth M. Karas \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nRe: United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) \nDear Judge Karas: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a  further update to the Court \nregarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the \nMetropolitan Correctional Center (\"MCC\") on July 22 —  July 23, 2019. On or about December \n19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it had confirmed with MCC \nstaff that the requested video had been preserved, and that the Government was working to obtain \na copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the Government has learned that the MCC \ninadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within the MCC, and, as a result, video from \noutside the defendant's cell on July 22 —  23, 2019 (Le. the requested video) no longer exists. \nOn or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded \nto the cell (\"Cell-1\") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, \ndefense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from \nJuly 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal \ncounsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked \nup the defendant's cell number in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC \nstaff preserve video from outside of that cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member \nconfirmed that the video had been preserved. \nOn or about January 3, 2020, the MCC provided the Government with a copy of the video \nthat it had preserved, which the Government then converted into a  playable format. After \nreviewing the video, it appeared to the Government that the footage contained on the preserved \nvideo was for the correct date and time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was \nlocated because the preserved video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the \ncells seen on the video. After speaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government was informed \nthat the MCC computer system listed a different, incorrect cell for Tartaglione (\"Cell-2\"). \nTherefore, when MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be \npreserved, \nthe MCC preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1. \nEFTA00017953\n\nJanuary 9, 2020 \nPage 2 of 2 \nThe Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a \nbackup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit, including the video \nrequested by defense counsel. The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation that it has reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and \ndetermined that the requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at \nleast August 2019 as a result of technical errors. \nThe Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense \ncounsel's review at the United States Attorney's Office. \nRespectfully submitted, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  /s/\nAssistant United States Attorneys \nCc: \nCounsel of record (by ECF) \nEFTA00017954",
