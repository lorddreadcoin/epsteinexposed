    "text": "\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 1 of 5 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nCASE NO. \n08-80736-CIV-MARRA \nJANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2, \nPetitioners, \nvs \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \nRespondent. \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nLimited \nIntervenor. \nLIMITED INTERVENOR JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR \nLEAVE TO \nFILE A REPLY ON OR \nBEFORE \nAUGUST \n22, 2019 \nLimited Intervenor JEFFREY EPSTEIN, through \nundersigned counsel, respectfully \nmoves the Court for an Order granting him leave to file a  reply to Petitioners' Reply to \nIntervenor Epstein's Brief in Opposition to Proposed \nRemedies (DE 466), on or before \nAugust 22, 2019. \n1. On May 13, 2019, this Court entered an Order (DE 454) setting a  briefing \nschedule for the Petitioners to file their initial \nsubmission on proposed remedies, \nthe government and Mr. Epstein to file a response, and for Petitioners to file a \nreply. \n2. Petitioners filed their initial submission on May 23, 2019 (DE 458), the \ngovernment filed its response on June 24, 2019 (DE 462), Mr. Epstein filed his \n1 \nEFTA00021512\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 2 of 5 \nresponse on July \n8, 2019 (DE 463), and Petitioners filed their replies to the \ngovernment and Mr. Epstein's submissions on July 9 & \n23, 2019, respectively \n(DE 464; DE 466). \n3. Petitioners' reply to Mr. Epstein's Brief (DE 466) is 65 pages long. In that reply, \namong other things, Petitioners' counsel: \na) raise an issue, for the first time, about the binding nature of the NPA \non other districts, which is not relevant to the issues before the Court and has \nnever been briefed before this Court (DE 466:3-5); \nb) rely on \nsealed documents that Mr. Epstein has never seen (DE 466:19-\n23, 48), to argue, for the first time at the remedy phase, that a  purported \nconflict of interest that allegedly plagued one of Mr. Epstein's lawyers \nsomehow requires partial rescission of the NPA, despite that it is a criminal \ndefendant's sixth amendment right —  not an alleged victim's —  to insist that \nthe defendant be represented by conflict-free counsel; \nc) rely heavily on the case of San Pedro v. United States, \n79 f.3d 1065, \n1068 (11\" Cir. 1999) (DE 466:24-25, 38), an easily distinguished case not \ncited by Petitioners in their initial submission (DE 458) that Mr. Epstein has \nnever had an \nopportunity to address; \nd) adopt \npositions that are different from their initial submission, \ncompare DE 466:27 (now defining \"partial rescission\" as \"rescission of the \nimmunity provisions for only those victims who seek rescission\") with DE \n2 \nEFTA00021513\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 3 of 5 \n458:4, 5, 13 (not limiting the request for partial rescission to only \nPetitioners); \ne) accuse Mr. Epstein's \ncounsel of \"misleading briefing\" in the section \non the general releases in the Settlement Agreements (DE 466:42), for using \nellipses in \nplace of the words \"compensatory or punitive damages,\" even \nthough the general releases preclude all actions or claims in equity against \nMr. Epstein which, by definition, involve injunctive relief and do not involve \ncompensatory or punitive damages; \n0 \ncontend that the Court's Order (DE 454:2) permitting the filing of \naffidavits and declarations at the remedy phase undermines Mr. Epstein's \nprocedural due process argument (DE 466:7-10), a contention to which Mr. \nEpstein has never had an \nopportunity to respond; \ng) mischaracterize Mr. Epstein's discussion of the \nWalke• \ncase (DE \n464:55-56), \ninasmuch as it was not the Seventh Circuit's ruling in Walker \nthat Mr. Epstein claimed was \"entirely confused,\" but rather the Petitioners' \ndiscussion of it in their initial submission. (DE 463:25); and \nh) advocate for a remarkably primitive view of the constitutional role of \ndefense lawyers, labeling as \"bad faith\" defense counsel's denial of their \npresumptively innocent client's guilt (DE 466:21), and claiming that they are \n\"instigators\" of government violations as a  result of demands they made, \nwithout coercion or bribery, during the normal back and forth of plea \nnegotiations. \n3 \nEFTA00021514\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 4 of 5 \n4. Given the new arguments, changed position, and the stakes involved, Mr. \nEpstein respectfully requests leave to file a reply to Petitioners' recent \nsubmission on or before August 22, 2019. \n5. Mr. Epstein is currently detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in \nManhattan. As a result, it is more time-consuming to review drafts of a \nsubmission with him before the submission is filed. \n6. Counsel for Mr. Epstein communicated with AUSA Jill E. Steinberg, counsel \nfor the government, who advises that the \ngovernment does not object. Counsel \nfor Mr. Epstein also communicated with Paul Cassell, counsel \nfor the \nPetitioners, who advises that the Petitioners will likely object. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/Roy Black \nRoy Black, Esq. \n(FL Bar No. \n126088) \nJackie \nPerczek, Esq. \n(FL Bar No. 42201) \nBLACK, SREBNICK, KORNSPAN & STUMPF, P.A. \n201 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 1300 \nMiami, Florida \n33131 \nTele: (305) 371-6421 \nFax: \n(305) 358-2006 \nE-Mail: rblack@royblack.com \nE-Mail: jnerczek@royblack.com \n4 \nEFTA00021515\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 5 of 5 \n/s/Martin G.
