Looping in • and Please do keep exploring the option. If it's doable it might \nbeat out our lobby—definitely seems like a stronger visual. On that note, if it was possible for one of you to take Audrey \non a walk-through of 290 as we figure it out, she'd appreciate it. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Tuesday, June 30, 2020 10:38 AM \nTo: (USANYS) <->; (USANYS) < \nSubject: RE: COVID Language for Press Release \nWait, I thought we were now targeting the lobby of I just got off the phone with from the FBI \npress office, inquiring about the logistics of that. I think they can get chairs for press, check with GSA on their Covid \nprotocols (capacity, etc.), provide a \"step-and-repeat\" (a portable background with \"FBI\" and their seal) to reduce glare \nfrom the windows on the Duane Street side. The concerns are the acoustics (as you know, that space is cavernous, with \nall hard surfaces and a high ceiling) and their lack of a podium (so we'd have to lug ours over there). Is our lobby \npreferable? I can call back and call off the dogs. \nFrom: (USANYS) <> \nSent: Tuesday, June 30, 2020 10:15 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: COVID Language for Press Release \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) < \nThe International Court of Trade has said no, so it looks like we're likely at Plan B (Plan Z?) option of using our whole lobby \nspace in an effort to create some social distance. \nWith apologies for adding to your full plate, Audrey asked if you could please come up with a paragraph to put at the top \nof tomorrow's press advisory, notifying the press of safety protocols—masks, social distancing, etc.—and asking them to \nplease leave extra time to get into the building (which may mean we should also send out the advisory earlier than \nusual). I've attached our safety protocols and am cc'ing El (and M, though he's out), since I know you'll want to \ncoordinate with them on how press screening will work. Happy of course to talk or help in any way. \nThanks! \nEFTA00015354",
