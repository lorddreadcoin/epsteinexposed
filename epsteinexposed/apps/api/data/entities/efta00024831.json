Specifically, in United States v. Boustani (copy \nattached), the court held that the Bail Reform Act does not permit wealthy defendants to be \nreleased to \"self-funded private jails\" in circumstances where poorer defendants would be \ndetained: \n\"We now expressly hold that the Bail Reform Act does not permit a  two-tiered bail \nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy \ndefendants are released to self-funded private jails. It is a fundamental principle of fairness \nthat the law protects 'the interests of rich and poor criminals in equal scale, and its hand \nextends as far to each.' To interpret the Bail Reform Act as requiring district courts to permit \nEFTA00024831\n\nwealthy defendants to employ privately funded armed guards where an otherwise similarly \nsituated defendant without means would be detained would violate this core principle. Such \na two-tiered system would 'foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a  very small \ncohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy.' \nSlip op. at 7 \nThe court recognized one potential exception to this principle, i.e., \"where the defendant is \ndeemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a  defendant may \nbe released on such a  condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been \ndetained.\" Id. But it appears that this exception is a narrow one, since the district court in \nBoustani  cited the defendant's wealth as \"one of many factors\" but \"did not rely primarily on \nBoustani's personal wealth in finding that he posed a flight risk.\" Slip op. at 9. Thus, because \n\"[a] similarly situated defendant of lesser means surely would be detained pending trial, ... \nBoustani is not permitted to avoid such a result by relying on his own financial resources to \npay for a private jail.\" \nI do not expect that this opinion will be the last word on this issue, but it is now the \ngoverning law in the Second Circuit. \nEFTA00024832",
