I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. \nI apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. \nRegardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 \nyears and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. \nThanks, \nJeff \nJeffrey L.

In \nreviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose.
