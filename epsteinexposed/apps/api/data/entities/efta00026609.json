At the time I could not find \nout what solicitors were representing him -- Around mid-March 2020, I learned that two British lawyers were \nrepresenting him: Gary Bloxsome, a London Solicitor who specialized in Extradition matters, and Clare \nMontgomery, QC, a Barrister, also sp • •   • • tradition matters. I emailed both to see if I could get an \ninterest. Bloxsome never replied and Paralegsal Clerk to Montgomery, emailed me back to \nindicate she had read and acknowledged my email. No further responses since that time. \nI am assuming that it is their intention to do nothing -- expecting that your investigation will not proceed. There \nis no question in my mind that Andrew was deeply involved with Epstein and was very friendly with Ghislaine \nMaxwell and likely is in touch with her now believed to be in Israel. \nSo, I wish you good luck and perhaps his counsel will reach back to me. \nBill Callahan \nWilliam P.
