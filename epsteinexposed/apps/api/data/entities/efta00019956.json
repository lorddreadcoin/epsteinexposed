Weinberg\"\n\"Weingarten, Reid\" \nCc: \"I \nSubject: RE: US v Epstein \nDate: Sat, 10 Aug 2019 20:53:05 +0000 \nAttachments: Jeffrey_Epstein_Statement_8.10.19_PR.pdf \n r  • \n>, \nMike, \nI know we just spoke but I wanted to memorialize the information for everyone in one place — regarding your question \nabout the \"a' (phonetic) who called an individual associated with Mr. Epstein regarding next steps for \nrecovery of Mr. Epstein's body, we confirmed with BOP that the call was not a hoax; Mr. does work for BOP / MCC \nand his contact number is in fact \nThe slight divergence of the BOP account from your understanding is that BOP advised us that Mr. had contacted \nMr. Epstein's brother to advise that when the body is ready, part of BOP's responsibility is to arrange for its transport (and \npossibly other notifications or logistics for next-of-kin). They were not trying to convey that the body is ready now; rather, \nthey expect it will be some time until that is the case, but they wanted to contact next-of-kin immediately. So you and/or \nMr. Epstein's brother should feel free to be in touch with BOP at that number if and when that would be useful. \nSeparately, it is in process for us to determine whether we are able to provide a contact name and number for the new \ninvestigation(s), but in the interim, as we discussed, you should feel free to refer any individuals to the FBI tip line, which \nwill continue to do intake on all Epstein-related matters including the new investigation; that number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. \nFinally, attached is a statement put out by our office this afternoon, so you have it directly. Given the active investigation \ninto the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death, I think it is possible we will not receive additional substantive information in \nthe immediate future (or that if we do, it will be information we're not permitted to share outside our Office because of \nthe nature of the investigation), but we will continue to convey any substantive information that we can. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 11:57 \nTo: Miller, Michael \nCc: \nSubject: Re: US v Epstein \nMike, Marty, Reid, \nMartin G. \nWeinberg <>; \nWeingarten, Reid \nFollowing up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments \nago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents \nall the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get \nadditional information we will pass it along immediately. \nSeparately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are \naccurate, and I  fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. \nEFTA00019956\n\nAs always \nplease don't \nhesitate to reach out \nto us directly at \nany time if \nthat would be \nuseful. \nthank you, \nEFTA00019957",
