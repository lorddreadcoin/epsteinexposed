Florida 33160 \nwww iermar. aVil COM \nThis concerns your letters to us and to sexual assault victims of Mr. Epstein dated September \n2, \n2008. Please \nbe \nadvised that we strenuously object to your letters on various grounds, and believe \nthat they arc in violation of the Florida Bar Rules. \nFirst, your letters attempt to steer the victims to a  particular attorney, Mr. Josefsberg, and \nadvise them that Mr. Josefsberg will be making an unsolicited contact to them in the next two weeks. \nThis contact with prospective clients and solicitation reflected in your letters is contrary to Fla. Bar. \nRule 4-7.4. Additionally, your letters are misleading in the following respects: (1) the action \nadvocated to the victims in paragraph 2 refers generally to the victims' \nwaiver o f \"any \nother \nclaim for \ndamages\", failing to advise them that this waiver may include a valuable claim to punitive damages \nagainst an alleged billionaire; and (2) the letters imply in paragraph 3 that Mr. Epstein's agreement to \npay attorney fccs is a significant concession, when in fact a victim is entitled to reasonable attorneys' \nfees under the Statute upon proof of a \nviolation, irrespective of Mr. Epstein's agreement. \nWe accordingly \ndemand that the U.S. Attorneys' office immediately cease and desist from \ndirecting unrepresented victims into \nunsolicited attorney contacts and misleading them about their \nrights in claims against Mr. Epstein. We \ndemand that you instruct Mr. Josefsberg not to solicit \nvictims, and to send letters to \nunrepresented victims correcting the misleading \nstatements contained \nin your September 2, 2008 letters. \nEFTA00013956\n\n305-9312200 \nHerman &Mermelstein, P 10:48:58 a.m. \n16-09-2008 3 /3 \nEsq.\nSeptember 16, 2008 \nPage 2 \nFinally, we demand that you make no contact with \nour clients directl , and contact them onl \nthrough our \noffice.
