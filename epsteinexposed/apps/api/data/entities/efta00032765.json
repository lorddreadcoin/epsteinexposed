Yes, please mark those types of issues as \"For Further Review\". And please let me \nknow if any other questions come up. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, April 20, 2021 4:27 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Epstein Relativity Questions \n> \nI just had a  quick question about how to mark a  couple of these documents. For some reason USPV00341820-26 were \nblank. I tried clicking image and extracted text and those didn't help. Also, for the documents USVP00341831-51, skipping \nsome here and there, they said \"Browser does not support this multimedia format\". I marked all of these \"For further \nreview\", is this how you want them marked or do you want me to change that to something else? \nThank you, \nEFTA00032765",
