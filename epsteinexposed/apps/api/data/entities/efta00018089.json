You then go up to the top left and choose \nthe Report drop down and then choose Generate a  New Report.

As soon as you can release even just some of those reports, \nwe will dive into the responsiveness review. \nTo give you a sense of timing: In order to give our paralegals enough time to prepare the responsive materials for \nproduction in time for our 11/9 deadline, we need to finish the responsiveness review by no later than Thursday 11/5. \nSo the sooner we can get anything over the wall for us to review, the better. \nThanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 29, 2020 11:11 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Help with Epstein Privilege Review \nJust to be safe, please double check when you open up the reports that they correspond to the notes below, i.e., 1872 \nshould not have chats and 1B69 should not have chats and should only have 1074 emails.
