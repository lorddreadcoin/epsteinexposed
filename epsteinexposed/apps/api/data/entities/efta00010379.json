I didn't want to go \ninto your office, so I put it in the doorway. \nIt's the discovery drive that Epstein's attorney's returned to us (consistent with the terms of the protective order) \nfollowing his death. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00010379",
