    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: New mcc problems \nDate: Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:27:31 +0000 \nBruce, \nThanks for raising these issues with us in advance of the conference. We appreciate the o ortunit to t and \naddress them with MCC in advance. Below are responses based on our conversation wi and \nwe have copied all counsel because until Judge Karas instructs us otherwise, we intend to communicate with all \ncounsel of record. \n1  — has advised us that allowing a tour of this kind is a security risk for the institution because, among \nother things, you have asked to tour areas where many inmates will be, and the institution cannot be locked down \nfor \npurposes of an outside person taking a tour absent a very specific and pressing reason. also advised \nthat were the Court to order such a tour, MCC would set very specific conditions and ask that the Government \nalso be \npresent. \n2 — has advised that she is working with SIS to get a date and time for the inspection of physical \nevidence, and hopefully will be reaching out today to schedule the inspection. \n3 — has advised that upon receiving your email, she had her staff speak with about the \nheat. The staff took heat reports in the unit and found the temperature was high. The staff made adjustments and \nthere have not been complaints since. We have asked for another temperature reading to be taken in the unit \nbefore Wednesday's conference to ensure the temperature is at an acceptable level. \n4 — has advised that she asked you for additional information that she can discuss with the Warden in \norder to assess the request for a family visit, but has not heard back from you. As previously discussed, in order \nfor the MCC to make an exception for your client, a social visit must be necessary for preparation of the defense. \nThe Government is not trying to, nor does it want to be, in the middle of that assessment, but we understand \nfrom the MCC that your most recent request was conclusory and they need more detail to make an assessment of \nthis new request. \nCo\n-Chief, Narcotics Unit \n Original Messa e \nFrom: Bruce Barke \nSent: Thursda , Janua 16, 2020 11:43 AM \nTo: \nCc: Aida Leisenring \nSubject: New mcc problems \nIn case we don't have enough to do on the 22nd, I intend to raise several issues about the jail. In no particular \norder; \nEFTA00017026\n\nI. They are refusing to allow us to view the cells and common areas where Nick has been held for nearly 3 years. \nInitially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the staff. We \nare going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd. \n2. I have written multiple emails to asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July \n23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all \n3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be \nhospitalized. We have not been given an update. \n4. We asked for a family visit after next week's court appearance and gave the same reasons we have been \ngiving. This time we were asked for more detail. I sense a change in the mcc approach. My inclination is to ask \nthe judge to help here. \nI was hoping the new administration would improve the conditions while maintaining \nresponsiveness. \nBruce Barket \nBarket, Epstein, Kearon, Aldea & LoTurco \n666 Old Country road \nGarden Cit , NY 11530 \nBarket \nEpstein.com \nEFTA00017027",
