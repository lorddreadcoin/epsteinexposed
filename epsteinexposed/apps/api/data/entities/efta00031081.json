(Reuters) \nSubject: Sasse Statement on Arrests of Epstein's Guards \n• \nFor Immediate Release Contact: James \nWegmann \nNovember 19, 2019 (202) 224-4224 \nSasse Statement on Arrests of \nEpstein's Guards \n\"These arrests are important, but they're not the end of this: These guards \naren't the only ones who should stand trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-\nconspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars.\" \nWashington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who \nwarned the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to come to today's oversight hearing prepared to \ngive answers, issued the following statement regarding the arrests of two of Jeffrey Epstein's \nEFTA00031081\n\nprison guards. \n\"Good. Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died. The Bureau of Prisons and the \nDepartment of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are \nimportant, but they're not the end of this: These guards aren't the only ones who should stand \ntrial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives \nbehind bars.\" \nBackground: \nOn November 13 Sasse told the Director of Bureau of Prisons to show up to today's hearing \nprepared to answer questions. \nOn August 19, when Attorney General Barr removed the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, \nSasse praised the move and called for more answers. \nOn August 13, Sasse urged Attorney General Barr to rip up the plea deal with Epstein that still \nshields his co-conspirators. That letter is available here. \nOn August 10, the day of Epstein's death, Sasse wrote to Attorney General Barr demanding that \n\"heads must roll\" and asking transparency questions to make sure the DOJ answers for the \nmiscarriage of justice. \nIn February 2019, at Sasse's insistence  the Department of Justice opened an investigation into \nits handling of Epstein, who was charged with running a child sex trafficking ring in New York and \nFlorida, among other locations. \nOn January 15 2019 during his confirmation hearing, William Barr, the President's nominee for \nAttorney General, publicly committed to making sure that the DOJ responded to Senator Sasse's \nquestions into the Epstein case and that they would prioritize the prosecution of sex-trafficking. \nIn late 2018, Sasse repeatedly pushed the DOJ to investigate the sweetheart deal \nthat Epstein received. \n#44# \nStay in touch with us online \nsasse.senate.gov\nEFTA00031082\n\nClick here to open this e-mail in its own browser \nwindow Click here to open a plain text version of this email \nEFTA00031083",
