If that sounds \nalright? \nthanks, \nFrom: Sigrid McCawley \nSent: Thursday, May 07, 202018:57 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: follow-up request \nC \nHello M, \nI am sure will be happy to help in any way she can.

As \nI'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, \nwhich also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might \nbe willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to \ndo it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any \nquestions at all. And if is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking \nduring an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. \nPlease let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, January 16, 2020 14:35 \nTo: \nSigrid McCawley \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \nGot it, thanks. \nfollow-up request \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nI  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Sigrid McCawley \nSent: Thursday, January 16, 2020 2:29 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \nC \n) \nfollow-up request \n< \nI  checked back with and she said that the last entry in her journal is in late \nFebruary and she \nwent to New Mexico in April. \nThanks \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOLES \nSCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nEFTA00025301\n\nEir \nwww.bsfllp.com\nSent by Boxer \nOn January 16, 2020 at 1:05:54 PM EST, \nThank you very much, Sigrid. \nwrote: \nJust to confirm, does have any journal entries regarding the time when she traveled to New Mexico?
