Particularly if you expect not to make a bail argument tomorrow, but rather consent to detention \nwithout prejudice to make an application in the coming days—we would just want to let the judge know that early \ntomorrow, if possible, - ' prefer to proceed. Certainly understand if not, of course, but just to mention it. \nIn any event, my cell i \nThank you, and talk soon. \nFro \nSent: a  ur ay, u y , : \nTo: 'Martin G.
