Let me circle up with a few folks, including BOP, about how best to proceed here, and I will get back to you. \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS)\nSent: Monday, April 12, 2021 11:36 AM \nTo: (USANYS)4 \nSubject: RE: Epstein Documents from BOP without Green Watermark \nHi \n(usANys)::. \nWe requested these from the BOP, and they provided a  set of documents, which we then produced to defense counsel. \nWe did not do a page by page comparison between the redacted set and the unredacted set, so we can't guarantee that \nthey are \"comprehensive.\" But we can provide you with what we have, assuming that there aren't any issues with us \nsharing in that way. \nBest, \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Sunday, April 11, 2021 12:27 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: Epstein Documents from BOP without Green Watermark \nand \n(USANYS)4 \nI recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent \ngreen watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court \nhas not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green \nmarking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the does, but it looks like not all. Do you have a \ncomprehensive set somewhere? \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nTelephone: \nEFTA00026909",
