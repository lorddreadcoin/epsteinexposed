Epstein had a broken \nhiatal bone and injuries to the left shoulder that are consistent with hanging. Per OCME, there is no reason to suspect \nthat Epstein did not hang himself. OCME will wait to finalize the report until after the toxicology reports come back, \nand OCME has had an opportunity to review any reports of interviews of the first guards on the scene who discovered \nEpstein. \nWe will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thanks. \nEFTA00023982",
