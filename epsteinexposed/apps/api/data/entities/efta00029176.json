Do you want to hold off on sending \nback to the team until reaches out? Since we're not telling them to cut the section (yet), I would be inclined \nto send this back now so they can start working through our comments, and then can reach out later today? I also \nthink it would be helpful both to morale and to getting up to speed to have • review the memo as drafted before \ntelling them to cut the • section. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, May 4, 2020 10:16 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \nSubject: \nHey \n> \nAre you able to reach out to the team to set something up for the next couple days? We are about to flip our edits to \ntheir memo back to them, and I want to be sure we have the teleconference with you before this memo is finalized. \nThanks! \nEFTA00029176",
