Specifically, a good friend of mine is the \nexecutive producer on a 4-part Netflix series that will come out in a  few months on Epstein (they had been working \non the story for 18 months before we charged). He had spoken ton one point (not sure how that \nworked!) and wants to see if anyone from the office would give an interview, all backward looking. I imagine the \nanswer is no but they are going with this regardless, so thought I would at least make you and potentially chiefs \naware of it. Wanted to start with you. I'm free between now and noon or after 6pm tonight, or tomorrow morning \nor after lunch. Thanks! \nEFTA00031457",
