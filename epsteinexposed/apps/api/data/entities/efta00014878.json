Morgan Securities LLC; August 16, 2019 and September \n3, 2019 Grand Jury Subpoenas to JP Morgan Chase; October 9, 2019 Grand Jury \nSubpoenas to JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. And All Affiliates \nDear \nIn response to the above-referenced subpoenas and to your request by email on \nNovember 22, 2021, on behalf of our client JPMorgan Chase (\"JPMorgan\" or the \"Finn\"), we \nsubmit the enclosed encrypted zip file containing account documentation bates labeled JPM-\nSDNY-00065519 through JPM-SDNY-00065530. \nAs discussed on November 22, 2021, this production includes account documentation \nrelated to account numb in the name of ASW Holdings, Inc. \nWe also wanted to provide the following additional information about the documents in \nour November 22, 2021 production. The November 22, 2021 production included account \ndocumentation related to account numbei in the name of Financial Trust \nCompany, Inc. (JPM-SDNY-00065487 through JPM-SDNY-00065493); account documentation \nrelated to account number in the name of \nJeffrey \nEpstein (JPM-SDNY-00065494 \nthrow h JPM-SDNY-00065499); and account documentation related to account number \nin the name of Ghislaine Maxwell (JPM-SDNY-00065500 through JPM-SDNY-\n00065518). \nShould you require any additional materials, please do not hesitate to contact us. \n* * * \nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 552, 28 C.F.R. § 16.8, \nand any other applicable law, rule, or regulation, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Don LLP \nrequests on behalf of JPMorgan that confidential treatment be accorded to this letter (Bates \nnumbered JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0001 through JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0003) and the referenced \nmaterials (Bates numbered JPM-SDNY-00065519 through JPM-SDNY-00065530 on JPM-\nConfidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0001 \nEFTA00014878\n\nWI LM ERHA LE \nNovember 23, 2021 \nPage 2 \nSDNY-VOL-012) (collectively, the \"Confidential Material\"). Accordingly, the Confidential \nMaterial has been marked \"Confidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase.\" The \nConfidential Material contains confidential business information concerning JPMorgan. \nFurthermore, public disclosure of the Confidential Material could reasonably be expected to \ncause substantial competitive harm to JPMorgan. Accordingly, the Confidential Material is \nsubject to, without limitation, Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), and the Trade \nSecrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1905, and will continue to remain exempt from mandatory disclosure \neven after the conclusion of the Department of Justice's (\"Department\") consideration of this \nmatter. \nWe note further that, since the Confidential Material constitutes investigatory records \nobtained by the Department in connection with a potential law enforcement proceeding, such \nrecords are subject, at least at present, to the exemption from mandatory disclosure under \nExemption 7(A) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).' Since the documents pertain to the \nactivities of JPMorgan, its employees, and its clients and their employees and agents, and not to \nthe activities of any federal agency, JPMorgan also believes the documents are exempt from \ndisclosure pursuant to Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).2\nShould any third person request the opportunity to inspect or copy the Confidential \nMaterial pursuant to the FOIA or otherwise, we request on behalf of JPMorgan that the \nundersigned immediately be notified of such request and be furnished with a copy of all written \nmaterials pertaining to such request (including but not limited to the request and any agency \ndetermination with respect to such request). JPMorgan expects that it will be given an \nopportunity to object to such disclosure. And, should the Department be inclined to grant any \nsuch request, it is JPMorgan's expectation that, pursuant to the procedures required by 28 C.F.R. \n§ 16.8, and Exec. Order 12,600, 52 Fed. Reg. 23,781 (1987), we will be given reasonable \nadvance notice of any such decision to enable our client to pursue any remedy that may be \navailable to it.' In such event, we request that you telephone the undersigned rather than rely \nupon the United States mail for such notice. If the Department is not satisfied that the \nsubmission is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the FOIA, we stand ready to supply further \nparticulars. \nThe requests set forth in the preceding paragraphs also apply to any memoranda, notes, \nrecordings, or other writings of any sort whatsoever which are made by, or at the request of, any \nemployee of the Department (or any other government agency) and which (I) incorporate, \ninclude, or relate to any of the information contained in the Confidential Material; or (2) refer to \nany conference, meeting, telephone conversation, or interview between (a) our client's current or \nformer employees, associates, representatives, agents, auditors, or counsel and (b) employees of \nthe Department (or any other government agency). \n2 \n3 \nSee, e.g., NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978). \nSee Dept ofJustice v. Reports Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989). \nSee, e.g., Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281 (1979). \nConfidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0002 \nEFTA00014879\n\nWI LM ERHA LE \nNovember 23, 2021 \nPage 3 \nThis letter is not intended to, and does not, waive any applicable privilege or other legal \nbasis under which information may not be subject to production. \n* * * \nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me at the above-referenced number. \nSincerely, \nEnclosure \nConfidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0003 \nEFTA00014880",
