WEST \nVIRGINIA 25301 \nJune 19, 2008 \nMr. John Roth \nSenior Associate Deputy Attorney General \nOffice of the Deputy Attorney General \nUnited \nStates Department of Justice \n950 \nPennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, \nD.C. 20530 \nDear Mr. \nRoth: \nTELEPHONE \nI304) \n345-7250 \nFACSiMILE 004) 345.9941 \nWRITERS \nDIRECT DWI \nGmvil \nI write to offer \nmy reaction to the May \n15, 2008 correspondence \nfrom the United States \nDepartment of Justice Child \nExploitation and Obscenity \nSection (\"CEOS\") \nregarding the federal \ninvestigation of Jeffrey Epstein \nby the United States \nAttorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of \nFlorida \n(\"USAO\"),I   I will refrain \nfrom recounting Mr. \nEpstein's arguments in detail \nhere, but, \nrather, will \nhighlight salient points \nresponsive to the CEOS \nletter. \nIn \nparticular, I write from a \nbackground well familiar \nwith child exploitation \ncases and \nvictim/witness issues. As the CEOS \nletter points out (CEOS letter \nat p. 3), I was a member of \nCEOS. In fact, I served \nas a federal prosecutor for \ntwelve years; five years as an \nAssistant United \nStates \nAttorney for the Southern \nDistrict of West \nVirginia, and seven years at \nCEOS. I began \nworking as a \ntrial attorney for CEOS in \n1999, and was promoted to \nDeputy Chief for \nLitigation in \n2002, and ultimately to Principal \nDeputy Chief for the Section in 2004. \nAs those \nwho have worked with \nme know, I have a history of \nworking diligently on \nbehalf of \nvictims of crime. While at the \nUnited States Attorney's Office for \nthe Southern District of West \nVirginia, I was a part of the prosecution \nteam that prosecuted the first \ncase in the country under the \nfederal Violence \nAgainst Women Act. United \nStates v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (4\n1  Cir.), cert denied, \n522 U.S. 896 (1997). The \ncase went to trial and the defendant \nwas sentenced to life in prison. I also \nspearheaded the domestic violence and \nfederal criminal child support \nprosecution efforts for that \noffice, \nprosecuting some of the first cases in the \ncountry under the federal Child Support \nRecovery \n1 Citations to the May 15, 2008 correspondence will be referenced herein as \n\"CEOS letter at p. .\" \nEFTA00013785\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 2 \nAct. Later, while at the \nDepartment of Justice, I co-authored the Department's Federal Child \nSupport Prosecution Handbook. \nMy work at CEOS permitted me to continue my efforts on behalf of vulnerable victims of \ncrime. While there, for example, I was part of the prosecution team in United States v. Dwight York, \n428 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir. 2005), cert denied, 548 U.S. 908 (2006). York was the leader of a pseudo \nreligious organization, and systematically molested countless children, some as young as six years \nold. The case went to trial and York was \nsentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of that trial team, \nI was awarded the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service. Additionally, at CEOS I \nwas one of the architects of the Innocence Lost Initiative, a nationwide initiative \ndesigned to combat \nchild prostitution. For this, I was awarded an Assistant Attorney General's Award for Outstanding \nVictim/Witness Service. Likewise, I was awarded a subsequent Assistant Attorney General's \nAward \nfor Special Initiative in connection with a nationwide sex tourism prosecution initiative I helped to \ndevelop. \nI say all this not for any boastful purpose, but, rather, to make clear that I am fully cognizant \nof victim issues, and that I am no pushover in terms of prosecution standards. I am also very well \naware of the good work of CEOS, and the outstanding credentials of those who toil in that office. \nWith all due respect to CEOS, however (and recognizing that their review of this case was \nquite limited), given the facts and circumstances of this investigation, a federal prosecution of Mr. \nEpstein simply should not be countenanced. In my view, such prosecution would be counter to the \nimportant \nmandate of the Department \nof Justice as emblazoned on its \nseal, \"Qui Pro Domina Justitia \nSequitur,\" referring to the Attorney General \"who \nprosecutes on behalf of justice.\" \nAs you well know, it is fundamental to that mandate that, as the representative of the people \nof the United States, the duty of a federal prosecutor is not simply to seek conviction as at any cost, \nbut, rather, to seek justice. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). (\"The United States \nAttorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty \nwhose \nobligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at \nall.\") While it is true \nthat Berger was decided at the post-trial, as opposed to the pre-indictment, stage of the case, the \nbedrock principle contained in the above quote should \ntranscend the entire investigation and \nprosecution process. Indeed, it is \narguably most imperative at the investigation stage, at which point \nlaw \nenforcement is dealing with a \npresumptively innocent citizen. \nIn summary, we understand the allegations against Mr. Epstein to be that Mr. Epstein paid \nindividuals to find friends and acquaintances, certain of whom were under the age of 18, to provide \ntopless massages to him at his Palm Beach home in exchange for money. Mr. Epstein's assistants \nallegedly scheduled these massages for him over the telephone at the direction \nof Mr. Epstein, \nallegedly including some scheduling calls to underage women. However, \nthe evidence contradicts \nthese allegations. First, Mr. Epstein did not ask that the masseuses be \nunder the age of 18. To the \ncontrary, he specifically asked that they be 18 or older. As one witness commented, said tell \nEFTA00013786\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. Job Roth \nJune 19, \n2008 \nPage 3 \nthem you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house.\" Tr. at 38-39. \nSecond, Mr. Epstein himself did not schedule such appointments. Third, Mr. Epstein would not \nknow who would be providing a  massage at any \nparticular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr. \nEpstein's assistants \nwere not directed to contact underage women, and \nwere not aware of the true \nages of the women they contacted. In \nfact, more often than not, the masseuses \nthemselves, or the \nindividuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial \ncontact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his \nassistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these \nyoung women before they \narrived. \nThe \nallegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein \nengaged in unlawful sexual \nconduct \nwith certain underage women \nwho arrived at his house to \nprovide a massage. At times, \nduring these massages, Mr. Epstein \nmasturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small \nnumber of alleged acts \nof penetration. However, most of the \nwomen who performed massages on \nMr. \nEpstein were over the age of 18. Many \nof the young women have sworn \nunder oath that they, in \nfact, told Mr. \nEpstein that they were 18 or older, and \nthat they did so because they knew \nthat if they \nwere not 18 years old, \nthey would not be allowed into Mr. \nEpstein's home. In fact, Mr. \nEpstein has \npassed a polygra h \nexamination to this effect relative to the \ngovernment's primary, and youngest, \nalleged \nvictim . \nIndeed, many of the women also \nworked at local massage \nparlors, \nwhich \npresumably had a requirement that \nthe masseuse have reached \nthe age of majority. To \nthe \nextent there are \nallegations that Mr. Epstein \nshould have been alerted to \ncertain underage women \nbased on conversations he \nallegedly had with them, \nthose conversations would \nhave taken place in \nperson and \nat his home, thereby \nprecluding any prior \nscheduling with knowledge of \ntheir true ages. \nAs explained \nbelow, any factual allegations \nof repeat massages with \nsuch persons would lack \nnecessary \nelements required for a \nfederal nexus to such conduct. \nAll \nof the alleged activity \noccurred in Mr. Epstein's \nhome in Palm Beach, \nFlorida. Many of \nthe \nmassages allegedly involved \nconduct which, even if \nengaged in, is not proscribed by \nfederal law, \neither because the masseuses \nwere of age, or because conduct \nwith underage masseuses only \ninvolved \ntopless massages, massages in \nundergarments or naked \nmassages. To the extent \nprohibited \nsexual activity \noccurred, any \ninducement, enticement, and/or \npersuasion used would have \ntaken \nplace during a \nface-to-face encounter—thus \neliminating the possibility \nfor the commission of a \nfederal crime, which requires \nthe existence of a \ncommunication through a  facility of \ninterstate \ncommerce in which the defendant \npersuades or entices the minor to \nengage in illegal sexual activity. \nFurthermore, any \nprohibited sexual activity that \ndid occur based on the facts \non the record is best left \nto the state to \naddress because the facts of this \ncase do not fall comfortably \nwithin the federal \ndomain. \nThis is a \ncase about purely local activity, \ninvolving local actors, and affecting \nlocal \ninterests and thus, \nshould be handled by local \nauthorities. Nonetheless, the USAO \nhas indicated \nits intent \nto prosecute Mr. Epstein \nfor purported violations of \n18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, \n2423, and \n1591. However, \nas set forth in detail in prior \nsubmissions, the facts of this \ncase fall squarely \noutside the heartland of those \nstatutes -  in fact, in law, and in \ncongressional intent. As their \nplain \nEFTA00013787\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & \nTHONIAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 4 \ntext \nand history indicate, these statutes \nwere designed to address problems \nthat are truly national \nand \ninternational in scope: human trafficking in § \n1591; telephone or Internet sexual predation in \n§ 2422; and sex tourism in § 2423. \nUnlike the alleged conduct at issue here, those \nproblems \nunquestionably \npresent multi-jurisdictional obstacles that \nStates and localities cannot confront \neffectively on their \nown. Mr. Epstein's conduct was \npurely local in nature, and the \nState of \nFlorida and Palm Beach \nCounty are effectively prosecuting \nand punishing that conduct. \nAlthough CEOS asserts, \"that a prosecution of Mr. \nEpstein might not look precisely like the \ncases that came before it is not dispositive\" \n(CEOS letter at p. 4), the fact is this case does \nnot look \nanything like those cases. \nThe facts here do not carry any of the hallmarks that typify an appropriate \nfederal prosecution for child exploitation as reflected in \nall such prior federal prosecutions. \nSpecifically, the facts here do not \ncarry the hallmarks for a sex trafficking or child prostitution \nprosecution. \nMr. Epstein did not target minors. In fact, the evidence indicates just the opposite. \nThere was no travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit \nsexual activity. \nThere was no prohibited use of a facility of interstate commerce. There was no commercial for profit \nsexual enterprise. There was no force. There was no violence. There was no use of drugs or \nalcohol. There was no child \npornography. \n18 U.S.C. § 1591 is clearly designed to combat organized rings of individuals who engage in \nthe business of human trafficking, involving both a commercial and coercive component. As \nPresident Bush \nhas noted: \ngenerally speaking, trafficking in persons refers to actions, often including the use of \nforce, fraud or coercion, to compel someone into a situation in which he or she will \nbe exploited for sexual purposes, which could include prostitution or pornography, or \nfor labor without compensation, which could include forced or bonded labor . . . \ntrafficking in persons is often linked to organized crime, and the profits from \ntrafficking \nenterprises help fund other \nillegal \nactivities. The growth of vast \ntransnational criminal networks supported in part by trafficking in persons \nfosters \nofficial corruption and threatens the rule of law.2\nThis in no way describes the case here. Yet the USAO has been unwavering in its single \nminded focus to stretch \nthe limits of these federal statutes beyond their intended use, and beyond \nprecedent, in order to prosecute Mr. Epstein. As the CEOS letter acknowledges, the legal theories \nthe USAO \nintends to attempt to pursue against Mr. Epstein are \"novel,\" having never before been \nsanctioned by federal law. They should not be sanctioned now. As the Supreme Court recently \npronounced, when a statutory term in a criminal statute could support both a narrow or broad \napplication of the federal criminal law, \"the tie \nmust go to the defendant.\" United States v. Santos, \n553 U.S. and Cuellar v. \nUnited States, \n553 U.S (June 2, 2008), Slip Op. at 6. \n2 February 25, 2003 Trafficking in Persons National Security Presidential Directive. \nEFTA00013788\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nA MI and fair review of the facts \nhere is critical to this analysis. Yet, it is clear that CEOS \ndid not conduct such a review. In his recent letter to Jay Lelkowitz, First Assistant United States \nAttorney (\"FAUSA\") confirmed our understanding that the \nUSAO \nwas to have \n\"facilitated\" an \"independent de novo review of the investigation\" by the Department. (May 19, \n2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). Yet, the CEOS review was not complete, and by its own terms \nnot de \nnovo. \nAs CEOS itself noted, \"our review of this case is limited both factually and legally. We have \nnot looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to \nconduct a complete \nfactual inquiry from scratch.\" (CEOS letter at p. 1). Indeed, entire subject areas \nrelevant to the inquiry were not considered at all by \nCEOS. In essence, CEOS was only in a position \nto make the most cursory possible review, an \"abuse of discretion\" review, without considering the \nfacts at the necessary level of detail, and without taking into account the many and varied issues of \nmisconduct we have raised in this case. As \nthe CEOS letter indicates, \"we did not review the facts, \ncircumstances, or terms included in the \nplea offer nor any allegations that individuals involved in the \ninvestigation engaged in misconduct.\" (CEOS letter at p. 2). All of this begs the question — \nif it is \nnot CEOS' role to \"conduct a complete factual inquiry,\" and CEOS did not consider any of the \nallegations of misconduct here, which at the very least have created a  strong appearance of \nimpropriety, and, at worst evidence an intent and effort to unfairly \nprejudice Mr. Epstein to the \nfinancial benefit of the friends and colleagues of the prosecution team in the USAO, then where and \nwhen can justice ever hope to be served in this case? This is a prosecution burden that cannot, and \nshould not, \nbe brushed aside. \nWe contend the limited nature of the CEOS review deeply affected its conclusions. For \nexample, CEOS most likely did not review original documents, such as transcripts, and \ninstead relied \non the summaries of federal prosecutors and FBI agents, against whom we \nhave raised serious \nconcerns regarding misconduct. If the summary memos from the USAO are as flawed as other \nUSAO communications have been, and which we have been able to show are misleading and \ninaccurate, the CEOS abuse of discretion review is likely flawed as well. Moreover \nalthough the \nUSAO expected, and personally promised to us, an independent \nreview, FAUSA letter also \nmakes clear that our pivotal legal challenge to the use of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) had already \"been \npreviously raised and thoroughly considered and rejected by ... CEOS prior to\" the recent CEOS \nreview. (May 19, 2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). The fact that CEOS had to evaluate its own decision \nwith respect to some of \nthe allegations against Mr. Epstein prevents its subsequent review and \nopinion from being truly independent. \nFollowing this most recent CEOS review \"limited both factually and legally,\" and with no \ncitation to any case law relative to the statutes in question, CEOS concludes merely, \"federal \nprosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate (CEOS letter at p. 5);\" in essence, \nthat the United States Attorney could bring this case in the exercise of his federal discretion should \nhe so choose (\"we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize \nprosecution in this case.\"). (CEOS letter at p. 2). However, CEOS drew the conclusion that the \nEFTA00013789\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCRUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, \n2008 \nPage \n6 \nfederal prosecution \nof Mr. Epstein would not be \"improper or inappropriate\" absent any review at all \nof the misconduct here, and absent a \nfull review of the facts and law. The facts, the law, and the \nalleged misconduct are each necessarily inextricably \nintertwined with the question of whether or not \nthis is a viable federal \nprosecution. These imposed limits flawed \nthe review from the outset. In any \nevent, CEOS concedes that the defense team \nmakes \"many compelling arguments.\" (CEOS \nletter at \np. 5). In the end, then, one is left with the impression that \nthe CEOS review and opinion, although \nconcluding that the USAO could push forward at its own discretion, is a much \nqualified one. \nThe federal \nprosecution of Mr. Epstein has been a moving target from \nthe inception. Each \ntime the allegations, the witnesses or the \napplicable law is subject to a searching inquiry, we have \nfound \nthat the allegations have been misrepresented, the \nlaw does not apply to the actual facts here, \nand the USAO \nprosecution theory falls apart. Yet, in the face \nof the voluminous evidence we have \nsubmitted in this regard, \nwhile acknowledging that the theories \nare \"novel,\" and that our arguments \nagainst federal prosecution are \n\"compelling,\" CEOS concluded, \n\"Mr. Acosta could rightfully \nconclude that \nthis federal issue is best resolved by \na jury\" and that \"the USAO has a \ngood faith basis \nto fully develop the \nfacts on this issue and brief the law to permit a \ncourt to decide whether the law \nappropriately reaches \nsuch conduct.\" With all due respect, and \nrecognizing that CEOS may be —and \napparently was —  limited in its \nauthority, it should not be the prerogative of \nthe prosecution arm of \nthe United States government to simply \nroll the dice, and let the court system \njust sort it out when \ndealing with \nthe life and liberty of a United \nStates citizen. The \nDepartment \nof \nJustice should not be \nso cavalier when \nlabeling someone as a child \nmolester. While it may be within the \ndiscretion of the \nUSAO to do so, it is \nnot in accord with the \nprinciples of justice. \nIndeed, as noted, just a few \nweeks ago, the Supreme Court \nunderscored this point in Santos \nand Cuellar. The \nCourt made clear that \nprosecutorial discretion does not provide the \nUSAO cart \nblanche to expand \ncriminal statutes as they seek to do here with \ncomplete disregard for congressional \nintent. The \nCourt rejected speculation as a basis of \ndetermining the scope of a criminal statute; \n\"probability is not a \nguide which a court, in construing a penal \nstatute, can safely take.\" Slip op. at 7, \nquoting United \nStates v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76,105 (1820). \"We \ninterpret ambiguous criminal \nstatutes in favor of defendants, \nnot prosecutors.\" Slip op. at \n12. \nBased on my experience, I  believe \nthat the facts here do not warrant a  federal child \nexploitation \nprosecution. At its core, this case is \nquintessentially a state concern as opposed \nto \nimplicating any federal interest. Indeed, \nthe Florida State Attorney's Office \n(\"SAO\"), led by the \nchief of the Sex Crimes Division, \nthoroughly investigated this matter, and presented it to \nthe grand \njury. \nThe facts, as opposed to the deeply fl\nawed press reports, were carefully \nassessed by \nexperienced State prosecutors who aggressively enforce \nState criminal laws. Following an extensive \n15-month State investigation, Mr. Epstein was \nindicted by a State grand jury on a single felony count \nof solicitation of prostitution. \nDuring the investigation, the State prosecutor exhaustively reviewed the evidence, \nmet face-\nto-face with many of the alleged victims, \nconsidered their credibility —  or lack thereof —  and \nEFTA00013790\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & 'THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 7 \nconsidered the extent of exculpatory evidence, including a psychosexual evaluation of Mr. Epstein \nand a polygraph examination demonstrating that Mat genuinely believed at the time of the \nalleged conduct that the State's key witness (= was over the age of 18. Then, after \nmonths of negotiations, the State reached what it believed was an \nappropriate resolution of the case. \nImportantly, this resolution was \nconsistent with that of cases involving other defendants who had \nengaged in similar conduct. Implementation of the \nState resolution of the case was held in abeyance, \nhowever, due to the unexpected \ncommencement of the successive federal criminal investigation. \nWhile it is true, as CEOS points out, (CEOS letter at p. 3) that many criminal prosecutions \nturn on issues of credibility of witnesses, to which many \nmembers of the defense team can attest \n(having had \ndecades of federal criminal litigation experience among us), this does not serve to divest \nthe prosecutor of his/her \nduty to make a searching inquiry of the facts before using the power of \nprosecution, and the weight of the United States government, to level serious accusations. CEOS \nlikewise acknowledges as much, \"the prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witnesses' \ncredibility.\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). \nSince the CEOS letter also singles me out as someone who should be familiar with witness \nissues, I feel compelled to note that, of course, I am well aware that it is not uncommon for witnesses \nto give conflicting statements. I am also \nfully aware that the credibility of key government witnesses \nmay be strongly impacted by the $50 million incentive provided via the civil lawsuits at play, and \nencouraged by the government here. 3   I have also read many of the conflicts \nbetween witness \ntestimony \nand Detective own rendition of that testimony in his reports and/or search \nwarrant affidavit. Detective apparently formed a  view early on as to the purported \ncriminality of Mr. Epstein's conduct regardless of the mountain of evidence to the contrary. For a \nprosecutor that has had an \nopportunity to review the full facts, and to meet with the witnesses, \nhowever, \n\"conflicting statements\" cross the line to a \"lack of credibility\" that simply can not sustain \na prosecution. That is where an appropriate application of prosecutorial discretion must be brought \nto bear. \nAgain, CEOS was not itself \nin the position to exercise such discretion. By its own admission, \nCEOS did not make a \nfull review of the witness statements here, and CEOS certainly did \nnot sit \ndown across the table and speak to these \nwitnesses. We understand that was apparently not its \nperceived role. But, CEOS should recognize that \nat least one prosecutor in this case —  the Chief of \nthe SAO Sex Crimes Division has done so. \nLana Belohlavek not only met with and interviewed \nthese witnesses during the \ncourse of the 15-month state investigation prior to any federal \ninvolvement, but she again sat across \nthe table from many of them in connection with recent civil \nrather, upon the complaint \nation waton the complaint of an \nalleged \nvictim, \nbut, \nfather, and her stepmother . More \n3 It is important to note here \nnotable still is the fact that has been convicted of federal bank \nfraud, and has a state \nconviction for identify fraud. Hardly pillars \nofill. Yet, the USAO did not supply this information to the \ndefense. Even more telling is the fact that Mr. \nfiled a $50million lawsuit purportedly on behalf of his \ndaughter without her authority or knowledge. \nEFTA00013791\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 8 \n0 \ndepositions in this matter. Ms. Belohlavek, and the SAO, is \nlikewise well familiar with the breadth \nof the federal investigation, and has \nintegrated that knowledge into the current enhanced state \nsentencing recommendation. The SAO remains firm in the position that the proposed state resolution \nis a sound one, and that there was no child exploitation here. Notably, however, not once during the \npendency of the federal investigation has the USAO ever reached out to its state prosecutive \ncounterpart that initiated this investigation in the first place to discuss the issues or to thoroughly \nferret out the facts or the witness credibility issues. \nIn the eight lines the CEOS letter accords to the topic of witness credibility CEOS asserts, \n\"there are \nmultiple mutually-corroborating witnesses,\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). However, the CEOS \nletter does not highlight a  single one. In contrast, we have put forth numerous \"mutually \ncorroborating\" witness statements. Far from supporting a  federal prosecution, these statements \ninstead corroborate that I) the alleged victims lied to Mr. Epstein about their age; 2) there was no use \nof a facility of interstate commerce by Mr. Epstein; 3) there was no inducement or coercion; 4) there \nwas no commercial enterprise; and 5) there was no illicit sexual conduct. \nIndeed, Mr. Epstein took several steps to ensure that no minors entered his, home most \nnotably, by affirmatively asking the women whether they \nwere actually 18. See e.g. Tr. At \n38-39. That fact —  which many of the potential witnesses have confirmed in sworn interviews \n—\nstrongly indicates that Mr. Epstein \nspecifically intended to preclude an one under 18 from giving \nhim a massage. That fact is confirmed by, among other things, \ntestimony that \"he \nlikes the girls that are between the ages of like 18 and 20 . . . .\" Tr. at 12. In fact, the \nevidence bears out that the majority of the women who came to Mr. Epstein's \nresidence to provide a \nmassage were over 18. \nMany of the young women who were aged 16 and 17 visited Mr. Epstein's residence only \nonce or twice, and the evidence strongl shows that the lied to Mr. Epstein about their age. Two of \nthese individuals, and , \nwere 14 and 15 at the time the met Mr. \nEpstein. Given that each has brought a civil lawsuit against Mr. Epstein, with Ms. and her \nfamily seeking $50 million from Mr. Epstein, their testimony against Mr. Epstein is per se suspect. \nBut, despite their obvious incentive to halm Mr. Epstein, their testimony actually confirms his \ninnocence. Ms. , for instance, has \ntestified that Ms. =, who introduced her to Mr. \nEpstein, expressly told her to lie to Mr. Epstein \nabout her age. \nQ: And told you that if you weren't 18 Epstein wouldn't let you into his house, \nright? \nA: \nThat's — yes, yes. \nTr. (deposition) at 32. \nQ: You didn't \nwant Mr. Epstein to know that you were lying about your age, \nright? \nEFTA00013792\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & \nTHOMAS, PLLC \nMr. \nJohn Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 9 \nA: \nCorrect. \nQ: You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were not 18 yet, right? \nA: Correct. \nTr. (deposition) at \n36. \nIn fact, Ms. \ntold Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old, and confirmed this fact with \nPalm Beach Police. M. at 36. \nBeyond that, Ms. \"swore on her mother's grave\" that she \nand Mr. Epstein did not engage in sex of any \nkind. Tr. (deposition) at 24. She further \nrepeatedly explained that prior to the time \nshe went to Mr. Epstein's house (she went there only \nonce), nobody ever \ntried to coerce her to en a  e m sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Not over the \ntelephone, not over the Internet, not at all. Tr. (deposition) at 31-32. These are not facts \nupon which a federal case can stand. \nMs. age \nwas also unknown to Mr. E stein when she went to \nhis home. \nwho was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ms. \n, testified in her federal sworn interview \nthat Ms. \ntold her to lie to Epstein. agc \nTr. at 8 (\"she just said make sure you're 18 \nbecause Jeffrey \ndoesn't want an underage girls') (emphasis \nadded). Ms. testimon \nstrongly \nsuggests that Ms. lied to Mr. \nEpstein about her own age as well. Ms. \nalso self represented that she worked at a local \nerotic massage parlor that presumably required a \nminimum age. \nThe \nconduct of \nis likewise illustrative of \"mutually corroborating\" testimony \nwhich ports the fact that this is not an appropriate federal \ncase. In the same way that Ms. \nwas referred to Mr. Elan and \nbrought to his home without havin been introduced or \nacquainted in any manner, Ms. was referred \nby someone else, , \nwho also told \nher to lie to Mr. Epstein about her \nage, which she did. \nt \nTr. at pp. 8-9). \nCEOS seeks to buttress the USAO \nprosecution by asserting \"it is possible to \nsatisfy that \nelement [proof of specific \nintent as to the age of the alleged \nvictims] with proof that the defendant \nwas deliberately \nignorant of facts which would suggest that the \nperson was a minor.\" (CEOS letter \nat p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the \nlaw and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance \nstandard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent n_qt to learn \nof an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of \nthe factual context of this case where there is \nrepeated proof that the \nminors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual \npractice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of \n18. \nss& \nUnited States \nv. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (I 1th Cir. 2006), quoting, United \nStates v. \nPuche  350 F.3d 1137, 1149 (111° Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate \nonly if it is shown [among other things] ... that the defendant purposely contrived to avoid learning \nEFTA00013793\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 10 \nof all of the facts in order to \nhave a defense in the event of a \nsubsequent prosecution.\"). Thus, the \nfacts preclude reliance on the \nconcept of deliberate ignorance as a substitute \nfor proof. \nThe fact that the \nsearch warrant affidavit in this case is \nrife with mis-statements and \nomissions \nregarding the key element of age is critical. \nHowever, CEOS concludes with no apparent \nsupporting analysis, \"despite the numerous \nfactual errors you describe, the U.S. Attorney's Office \ncould still plausibly argue that the mistakes —whether inadvertent or intentional — \nwere not material \nto the determination . . ..\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). Although, \nas CEOS notes, there are \"numerous\" \nsuch misrepresentations, through \naffirmative statement or intentional omission, a \nfocus on but one of \nthose misrepresentations highlights that \nsuch misrepresentations were, in fact, material. The \nfact is \nthat Detective grossly misrepresented Mr. \nEpstein's intent as it related to the age of the \nwomen he permitted entry to his residence. \nIn the search warrant \naffidavit, Detective affirmed that \nclaimed: \n[Mr. E stein told her the younger \nthe better. \nAnd, \nstated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the \nfemale was too old. \nWhat Detective \nM, no doubt intentionally, omitted was \n=s \nfurther explanation, \nwhich rendered Mr. \nEpstein's comments innocuous: \nA: Let me put it this way, he — I tried to bring \nhim a woman who was 23 and he didn't \nreally like it. \nQ: \nHe didn't go for it? \nA: It's not that he didn't \ngo for it. It's just that he didn't care for it. And he \nlikes the \ngirls that are between the ages \nof 18 and 20. (= Statement at 12) \n(emphasis \nadded). \nHad that \ncritical information, information that turns allegedly illegal conduct \ninto more \ninnocent conduct, been included, it would have \nseriously undermined the probable cause for the \nsearch warrant. \nSimilarly, and equally \nproblematic, Detective did not include the many statements \ndemonstrating that, when \nasked by Mr. Epstein, the women affirmatively misrepresented their ages \nm1.1\n18, and/or that Mr., was not aware of their true ages. Indeed, although Detective \ndid note that Ms. told Mr. Epstein that she was 18, he omitted from the affidavit \nthe key point as to why she lied: \nEFTA00013794\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 11 \nsaid tell him you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house. \nSo I said I was 18. As I \nwas giving him a massage, he was like how old are you. \nAnd then I was like 18. But I kind of said it really fast because I didn't want to make \nit sound like I was lying or anything. Tr. at 38-39. \nThus, consistent with the guidance provided in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the \nsearch warrant affidavit in this case reveals knowing and reckless falsehoods and omitted material \ninformation. This is precisely the type the United States Supreme Court sought to guard against. \nThe age of the alleged victims, and of Mr. Epstein's intent in that regard, is an element of the \ncrimes that must be proven in order to \nsustain a conviction. In particular, § 2422(b) requires that the \ndefendant specifically intended to target a minor. age, \na, United States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1286 \n(11th Cir. 2004) (\"[T]o \nprove an attempt the government must first prove that [defendant], using the \nintemet, acted with a \nspecific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in \nunlawful sex.\") (Emphasis added). Section 2422(b) expressly requires that the crime be committed \n\"knowingly,\" and that requisite mental element applies as to each element of the crime. United \nStates v. XCitement Video. Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 68-69 (1994); United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, \n718 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v. \nBailey  228 F.3d 637, 638-639 (6ih Cir. 2000). How, then, could the USAO \"plausibly argue\" that a \nmisrepresentation about an element of the \ncrime could be viewed as \"not material\"? If the elements \nof the alleged crime are not met, there is no probable \ncause to sustain the search warrant in the first \ninstance. If the \nelements are not met, there is no federal \ncrime. That is material. \nMoreover, it is clear from the plaint text of the \nstatute that the statutorily proscribed act \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2422(b) is the actual use of a facility of \ninterstate commerce to persuade, \nentice, induce, or coerce. \"The underlying criminal conduct Congress expressly proscribed in passing \n§2422(b) is the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the minor rather than the sex act \nitself. That is, if a person persuaded a minor to engage in sexual conduct (e.g., with himself or a third \nparty) without then committing any sex act himself, he would nevertheless violate §2422(b).\" United \nStates v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004). See also, United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d \n637, 639 (6'h Cir. 2000) (\"Congress has made a clear choice to criminalize persuasion and the \nattempt to persuade, not the performance of the sexual acts themselves.\"). Thus, if there has been \nsexual misconduct (which we deny) without the requisite \npersuasion, there is no violation of this \nfederal law. \nThe investigation and testimony in this case makes clear that Mr. Epstein did not use \nany \nfacility of \ninterstate commerce to commit any act forbidden by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(W—to persuade, \ninduce entice coerce—nor did he direct any of his \nassistants to do so. Indeed, by way of example, \nwas clear on this point at her \ndeposition during which she repeatedly testified that \nnobody—not Mr. Epstein or any \nof his assistants—ever used the Internet or phone in any way to try \nto persuade her to \nengage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Tr. (deposition) at 31-32. \nNonetheless, even assuming, arguendo, that persuasion to engage in sexual conduct occurred \nover \nEFTA00013795\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 12 \nthe telephone (which we deny), it is black letter law \nthat the mens rea must coincide with the actus \nreus. Thus, the \ngovernment must prove that Mr. Epstein has the specific intent \nto target a known \nminor to engage in prohibited sexual activity at the time of the call. \nWe have seen zero evidence of \nthis. To the extent Mr. Epstein later may \nhave persuaded a particular individual to engage in \nunlawful sexual activity during a massage, such persuasion occurred face to face, and can not work \nretroactively to render \nthe earlier phone call an offense under the statute. \nAs to the \npurported violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 for allegedly traveling in \ninterstate \ncommerce for the \npurpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity, CEOS does not deny that Mr. Epstein \nwas returning to one of his residences when he traveled to Florida.4  CEOS explicitly stated \nit \"fully \nunderstand[s] our argument\" (CEOS letter at p.2) that Mr. \nEpstein should not be charged under \n§ 2423(b) because the dominant purpose \nfor his traveling to Palm Beach was not to engage in \nillegal \nsexual activity, but to \nsimply return to one of his residences. \nRather, this is apparently another \n\"compelling\" point of law which may be left to \"a court to \ndecide whether the law properly reaches \nsuch conduct.\" (CEOS letter at p. 2).5  Notably, \nimplicit in this concession by CEOS is that the law \nhas never before been so applied, that is, there \nis no precedent for a court to extend the statute as the \nUSAO seeks to \ndo here. In fact, the United States Supreme \nCourt prohibited the criminalization of \ntravel under identical circumstances over a half \ncentury ago. Sis, Mortenson v. United States  322 \nU.S. 369, 374 (1944) (intention to engage in proscribed conduct must \"exist before the conclusion of \nthe interstate journey and \nmust be the dominate motive of such interstate movement.\" (Emphasis \nadded.) \nBeyond an absence of proof \nregarding the travel element in connection with 18 U.S.C. §2423, \nthe requisite age requirement for \na violation of that statute is important. 18 \nU.S.C. §2423, by \nreference to Chapter 109A (18 U.S.C. \n§2423(f)(1)), specifically defines a minor for \npurposes of that \nstatute as an individual who has \nnot attained the age of 16. If an alleged \nvictim is 16 years of age or \nolder, a violation of this statute \npursuant to 2423(0(1) can only occur if it \ncan be proven that force, \nthreat or drugs were \ninvolved. \n$x,18 \nU.S.C. §§ 2241 et seq. There are \nno such allegations here. As \na result, in order to find a violation under 18 \nU.S.C. § 2423, the United States would have to \nprove \nthat Mr. Epstein engaged in one of \nthe sexual acts defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) with an individual \nunder the age of 16, and \nthat he formed the intent and dominant purpose to cksi\norior to the time he \nmade a return trip to Florida. Again, there is no such evidence here. Ms. \nhas specifically \ntestified that 1) she never engaged in sexual \nactivity with Mr. Epstein; 2) she never even met \nor \ntalked to \nMr. Epstein prior to her arrival at \nhis house; and 3) she lied \nabout her age not only to Mr. \nEpstein, but, in fact, to the world on her \nMySpace page when she said that she was 18 \nyears old. It is, \nthen, also \nworth noting in this regard that \n18 U.S.C. §§2243(c) provides an \naffirmative defense if \nproven by a \npreponderance of the \nevidence \nif \nMr. Epstein \nreasonably believed that Ms. was \n4In addition to his residence there, \nMr. Epstein also has several \nbusinesses, and personal matters and \ncontacts to which \nhe attends in Florida. For example, \nbeginning in 2002, Mr. Epstein \nvisited his mother nearly every weekend \nin Palm \nBeach until she \npassed away in April, 2004. \n5 As previously set forth \nherein, and as more fully explained \nin other submissions related to \nthis case, the recent \nSupreme Court decisions in Santo \nand Cuellar make this \nattempted stretch of the law improper. \nEFTA00013796\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & \nTHOMAS, PLLC \nMr. \nJohn Roth \nJune 19, \n2008 \nPage 13 \nhad attained the requisite legal age. Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines \"illicit \nsexual conduct\" as any commercial sex act with a person under the age \nof 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g) \nalso provides a specific affirmative \ndefense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably \nbelieved that the young women had attained the \nrequisite \nlegal age. As we have \ndemonstrated, time and again the women \ninvolved lied to Mr. Epstein as to \ntheir true age, \nrepresenting that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented \nthat they worked at local \nmassage parlors, which presumably would \nhave imposed a  legal age \nrequirement. \nLastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein's conduct did not involve trafficking of \nwomen or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate, \nhad an economic impact on interstate or foreign \ncommerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not \nbenefit financially from the alleged conduct. \nTherefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes, \nMr. Epstein was a customer, a \"John\" for whom \nprosecutions are best left to the State to address. \nIndeed, there is no reported precedent \nextending federal law to a local \"John\" who \ndoes not violate \nthe child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS \ndoes not point to a  single case where federal \nprosecutors have used § 1591 in a case \ninvolving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution \nhas involved \nnational or international sex trafficking and/or \nfor-profit prostitution rings, involving \nthe knowing use of minors and/or forcible \ncoercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation. \nThese are \nthe elements required by the statute, and they are not met here. \nAlthough CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 \n(11th\n \nCir. \n2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved \nwholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far \ndifferent in key i‘ttnects than this one. The \nEvans case involved both the commercial and coercive \ncomponents that Congress, and administration policy \nstatements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 \nprosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not \n\"Johns.\" They \noperated a for profit prostitution ring \nmarked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the \nvictims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to \ncontinue to work even after she had been hospitalized with AIDS. As part of their business, Evans \nand his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and \ncondoms, and the victims \nwere forced to give all of their money from this \nprostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators. \nNone of this type of activity comes close to \nthe facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, \nbut significantly, \nthe prostitution ring in Evans was not, \nin fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of \none of the \nEvans co-defendants makes clear. See, \nUnited States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (11\nth\nCir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she \ntraveled to Atlanta, Georgia with \nMadison to work as a \nprostitute). \nThus, courts, including the \nEleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § \n1591 \nsimply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. \"Section 1591 \ndoes not \ncriminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice \ntraditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its \nreach is  limited to sex trafficking that \ninvolves children or is accomplished by \nforce, fraud, or \ncoercion.\" \nUnited States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; \nao gsa United States v. Sims, 171 Fed. \nEFTA00013797\n\nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 14 \nAppx. 849, 2006 WL 14581 at *3 (11th Cir. 2006) (to establish Sims's guilt on the sex trafficking of \na minor count, the government had to show that Sims benefited financially from Owen's sexual \nactivity and that Sims knew that (a) force or coercion would be used to cause Owens to engage \nin a \ncriminal sex act or (b) that Owens was under the age of 18.) (emphasis added). Again, none of these \nfactors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of the statute makes perfect \nsense: were § 1591 not limited \nin this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized \nbehavior that has nothing to do \nwith human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest. \nIn sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full de novo \nreview, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a \n\"novel\" application of three \nfederal statutes in the face of numerous \n\"compelling arguments\" is not warranted, as it  is not \nsupported by the facts, the law, or justice. \nEchoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the \nBerger  decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the \nRules of Professional Conduct (Special \nResponsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best \"A \nprosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of \njustice and not simply that of an \nadvocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to \nsee that a defendant is accorded \nprocedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of \nsufficient evidence.\" This is a responsibility that can not be taken \nfor granted. The government bears \nthe burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove \neach element of a crime with \nrespect to some \nspecific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case, \nhowever, the USAO has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not \nenough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out \nin the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USAO should not be permitted to pursue an \nunfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion. \nSuch prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be \nclear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go \ncompletely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as \nothers similarly situated. Therefore, we \ncontinue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and \nindependent \nreview, the only appropriate conclusion will be that \nthis case is best left to the state to \nresolve. \nSDT/kdt \nEnclosures \nSTEPHANIE D.
