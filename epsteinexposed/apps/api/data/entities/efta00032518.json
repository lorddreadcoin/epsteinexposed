Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) gives an interview at the Capitol. \n(Susan Walsh/AP) \nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) gives an interview at the Capitol. (Susan Walsh/AP) \nITEM. \nBYLINE \nTEXT \nBY JAMES HOHMANN \nwith Mariana Altaro \nTHE BIG IDEA: Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) is a former CIA analyst who \nserved three tours in Iraq as one of the American government's foremost \nexperts on Iranian-backed Shiite militias before being appointed as an \nassistant secretary of defense with a focus on the Middle East. But \nthat's not \nthe only experience that motivated Slotkin to draft the resolution \nlimiting President \nTrump's ability to take additional military action against Iran without congressional \napproval, which passed the House last night on a mostly party-line vote. \nEFTA00032518\n\nThe freshman congresswoman's son-in-law is an active-duty Army officer \nstationed at the al-Asad air base in western Iraq, which the Iranians hit with 11 \nballistic missiles this week in retaliation for the drone strike that killed Quds Force \ncommander Qasem Soleimani. Slotkin's husband also served 30 years in the Army, \nretiring as a colonel, and her stepdaughter followed in his footsteps. She was not \nlong ago commissioned as an active-duty Army officer. \n\"For me, this is not a theoretical exercise,\" Slotkin explained on Thursday \nevening. \"If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted war, the \npresident owes the American public a conversation. ... Congress has long \nabdicated its responsibility as laid out in the Constitution to make the hard \ndecisions we owe our troops.\" \nSuch deeply personal investment in the war effort blunts hyperbolic attacks \nfrom Republican lawmakers -  especially those who have never served in uniform \nand don't have relatives on the battlefield —  that opposing the escalation of conflict \nin the Middle East or supporting Congress asserting its constitutional role is \nsomehow unpatriotic. \nThe debate now moves to the Senate, which could vote as early as next \nweek, where it faces a more uncertain future. At least four Republicans need to \nvote for the resolution to ensure passage when it comes up, as early as next week. \nWhatever the Senate passes, if anything, would then need to be approved by the \nHouse before going to Trump, who has promised a veto that there would not be the \nvotes to override. \nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the lead sponsor of the accompanying resolution in that \nchamber, isn't just a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations \ncommittees. Kaine's oldest son, Nat, is an active-duty Marine infantry officer \nwho has been deployed overseas multiple times. \nEFTA00032519\n\nMcCarthy continues to accuse Pelosi of 'defending Soleimani' \n-- The Republican messaging machine has gone into overdrive this \nweek, with what has felt at times like a competition among party leaders to see \nwho could offer up the most incendiary quote questioning the motives of \nDemocratic lawmakers concerned about the possibility of a full-scale war against \nIran without congressional approval. \n\"This is a meaningless vote that only sends the wrong message that the House \nDemocrats would rather stand with the socialist base than stand against Iran,\" \nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at his weekly news \nconference on Thursday. \n\"Whether you mean to or not, you're empowering the enemy,\" said Sen. Lindsey \nGraham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to \nlawmakers who vote for the resolution. \n\"They are in love with terrorists,\" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top \nRepublican on the House Judiciary Committee. \"We see that they mourn Soleimani \nmore than they mourn our Gold Star families,\" Collins told Lou Dobbs on Fox \nBusiness. \n-- Democrats have decided not to just brush aside comments like this. \"I left \nliteral parts of my body in Iraq, where I was fighting terrorists,\" said Sen. Tammy \nDuckworth (D-Ill.), who has used a wheelchair since her Black Hawk helicopter \nwas shot down over Iraq in 2004. \"Donald Trump spent months attacking an \nACTUAL Gold Star Family,\" she added on Twitter. \"[Collins] should be ashamed of \nhimself for perpetuating this offensive lie.\" \nDuckworth is referring to when Trump, who received a deferment for \"bone spurs\" \nto avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, mocked Khizr and Ghazala Khan. \nTheir son Humayun was killed in action as an Army captain in Iraq. The Khans \nEFTA00032520\n\nspoke out against Trump at the Democratic convention in 2016, expressing \nconcern about his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. \n-- Collins apologized this morning. \"Let me be clear: I do not believe Democrats \nare in love with terrorists,\" he tweeted. \"As someone who served in Iraq in 2008, I \nwitnessed firsthand the brutal death of countless soldiers who were torn to shreds \nby this vicious terrorist. Soleimani was nothing less than an evil mastermind who \nviciously killed and wounded thousands of Americans. These images will live with \nme for the rest of my life, but that does not excuse my response on Wednesday \nevening.\" \n-- During the Thursday evening debate on the House floor, several Democrats \nemphasized their credentials as they made the case for the war powers \nresolution. Polls suggest that Democrats have tightened their traditional gap on \nwhich party is more trusted to handle national security. They won control of the \nHouse in the 2018 midterm elections thanks, in part, to a large cohort of young \nmilitary veterans in swing districts. There are 96 veterans in this Congress, \nincluding 30 Democrats and 66 Republicans. \nOne of those freshmen who delivered the majority is Rep. Jason Crow (D-\nColo.). He defeated a GOP incumbent in the Denver suburbs by touting his Army \ncombat experience. \"I have often heard folks say that now is not the time to \ndiscuss the use of force or the decision to send our men and women to fight,\" said \nCrow. \"I heard that in 2003 when I was carrying a rifle in Baghdad. I heard it again \nin 2004 and 2005 when I was leading my unit through the mountains of \nAfghanistan. And I am hearing it again today in the halls of Congress. In the last 19 \nyears, more than 7,000 Americans have given their lives in these conflicts, 53,000 \nhave been wounded and we have spent over $4 trillion dollars of taxpayer money. \n\"Do not believe the fearmongering,\" Crow concluded. \"I may have laid down \nmy rifle, but my oath to this country endures. I will fight to ensure that we are \nEFTA00032521\n\nhaving a discussion about when to send our men and women, our sons and \ndaughters, our sisters and brothers, into harm's way.\" \nPelosi on Iran: 'We must avoid war' \nSlotkin left her Pentagon job to move home to Michigan after Trump took \noffice. Then she toppled a longtime GOP incumbent the next year in the \nmidterms. She faces a tough reelection battle this fall in a district Trump \ncarried comfortably in 2016. The National Republican Congressional Committee \nhas taken to calling her \"pro-Iran Slotkin\" in news releases. \"Sit down, Elissa,\" one \nmissive from the House GOP campaign arm said this week. \nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the former vice president's daughter, called into a \nnews talk radio station in Slotkin's district on Thursday morning to attack her \nfor the \"appalling\" resolution, which she said \"will send a message to the \nIranians that the country is not united behind the president.\" Cheney told \nWILS in Lansing, Mich., that Slotkin's resolution showed \"there's a big difference \nbetween what she's saying at home and what she does when she gets here to \nWashington.\" \nIn a speech on the House floor before the vote on resolution, Slotkin pushed \nback forcefully on these criticisms. \"Soleimani was the lead architect of much of \nIran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East and throughout the world,\" she said. \n\"To that end, with Iran, or with any other adversary, the United States always has \nthe inherent right and obligation to self-defense against imminent armed attacks. \nAlways!\" \nSlotkin lamented that the country has been at war for nearly two decades, \nbut Congress has only voted twice in that time to authorize the use of \nmilitary force: in 2001 and 2002. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the lone \nEFTA00032522\n\nmember of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force \nimmediately after the 9/11 attacks, which is still being cited more than 18 years \nlater as a legal rationale for U.S. activities in the Middle East. Only 1 in 4 House \nmembers today were in Congress back then. \nThat 2001 authorization has been cited dozens of times, by three different \npresidents now, to justify deploying American troops to a list of countries \nthat includes Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, \nEthiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines and Cuba. The language of \nSlotkin's nonbinding resolution instructs Trump \"to terminate the use of United \nStates Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its \ngovernment or military\" unless Congress either formally declares war or there is \n\"an imminent armed attack upon the United States.\" \n\"When it comes to the matter of longer-term war, we have a constitutional \nresponsibility to authorize the use of military force,\" Slotkin reasoned. \"The \nframers of our Constitution rightly believed that the power to declare war belongs in \nthe Congress because this would ensure that the American people, through the \nlegislators they elected, would weigh the most significant decision a government \ncan make.\" \ntellRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) walks in the Capitol after casting his \nvote on the House floor. (Matt Rourke/AP) \nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) walks in the Capitol after casting his vote on the House floor. (Matt \nRourke/AP) \nSlotkin's resolution passed 224 to 194, with the support of three \nRepublicans plus independent Justin Amash of Michigan and the opposition \nof eight Democrats. The most notable vote for the resolution came from Rep. \nMatt Gaetz, one of Trump's most outspoken allies on Capitol Hill. \"I take a \nback seat to no member of this body when it comes to defending the president,\" he \nEFTA00032523\n\nsaid in a floor speech shortly before the vote. \"This resolution offers no criticism of \nthe president. It doesn't criticize the president's attacks on Soleimani. As a matter \nof fact, this resolution doesn't even say Soleimani's name in it.\" \nGaetz's district includes the naval air station in Pensacola, Fla. \"I represent more \ntroops than any other member of this body,\" he said. \"I buried one of them earlier \ntoday at Arlington, and that sergeant died a patriot and a hero. If the members of \nour armed services have the courage to go fight and die in these wars, as \nCongress we ought to have the courage to vote for them or against them. It's \nludicrous to suggest that we are impairing the troops from doing their job by not \ndoing our job articulated in the Constitution.\" \nThe other Republicans who voted for Slotkin's resolution were Rep. Francis \nRooney (Fla.), who is retiring, and Rep. Tom Massie (Ky.), a libertarian-minded \niconoclast. \nTwo of the eight Democrats who voted against it are freshmen who served in \nthe armed forces: Reps. Elaine Luria (Va.) and Max Rose (N.Y.). And Rep. \nStephanie Murphy (Fla.) was formerly a national security specialist at the Defense \nDepartment. The others who voted no are moderates from difficult-to-win districts, \nincluding Ben McAdams (Utah), Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.), Joe Cunningham (S.C.), \nKendra Horn (Okla.) and Josh Gottheimer (N.J.). \nTrump trashes Adam Schiff during Ohio rally \n-- Trump ripped the Slotkin resolution during a rally last night in Toledo, \nOhio, insisting he doesn't need to get permission from Congress to protect \nAmerica. \"[Soleimani] was a bloodthirsty terrorist ... and he's no longer a terrorist. \nHe's dead, and yet now I see ... the radical-left Democrats have expressed outrage \nEFTA00032524\n\nover the termination of this horrible terrorist,\" the president said. \"Instead, they \nshould be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless \nvictims were denied justice for so long.\" \nTrump singled out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who as the leader of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee,is a member of the Gang of Eight that's \nentitled to briefings on the nation's biggest secrets. Schiff spearheaded the \ninvestigation that led to Trump's impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction \nof Congress, and the congressman has clearly gotten under the president's skin. \n\"You lithe pencil neck,\" Trump said, referring to Schiff. Trump claimed, with no \nevidence whatsoever, that Schiff would have called CNN ahead of the drone strike \non Soleimani to tip them off and that this would have allowed the Quds Force \ncommander to get away. \"They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their \nfriends in the corrupt media,\" he said, referring to House Democrats. \nSlotkin's resolution explicitly makes an exception for defending against \"an \nimminent armed attack,\" but Trump ignored this as he complained about \nDemocrats trying to stop him from taking action if there's an imminent threat. \n\"He was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in \nBaghdad, but we stopped him very quickly and we stopped him cold,\" the president \ntold a crowd of nearly 8,000 supporters, referring to Soleimani. \"We didn't have \ntime to call up Nancy [Pelosi], who is not operating with a full deck.\" \nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \n\"It's not about how bad they are. It's about how good we are,\" Pelosi said \nat her weekly news conference, referring to Iran and Soleimani. (Felicia \nSonmez) \n;-'iSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) heads to the Senate floor for a vote. \n(Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) \nEFTA00032525\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) heads to the Senate floor for a vote. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) \n-- In the Senate, two Republicans have committed to support Kaine's \nresolution: Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.). Kaine is trying to woo \nat least two more GOP colleagues by offering to make amendments that \ncould get them on board. He's actively discussing draft text with Sens. Susan \nCollins (Maine) and Todd Young (Ind.). Kaine has already agreed to remove any \nreferences to Trump by name to make it more palatable for Republican colleagues, \nand he's willing to make more edits. \"It doesn't mean everyone I talk to will get on \nboard, but me sitting down with them and talking them through why I've done it this \nway, it gives them some level of comfort,\" Kaine told Jenna Portnoy. \nKaine vocally pushed to get Congress to authorize the use of military force in the \nMiddle East even when his good friend Barack Obama was president. (Read my \npiece about it from 2015 here). In fact, Kaine refused to modulate his position even \nwhen Hillary Clinton chose him as her running mate. His longtime emphasis on this \nissue undermines the GOP argument that his resolution is politically motivated. \nKeep an eye on Young, who happens to be chairman of the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee. I wrote a Big Idea in May about how Young's military service \nprompted him to focus on this issue when it looked like the United States might get \ndrawn into a war with Venezuela. \n\"I understand — as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer — the real-world \nlimitations to and the sensitivities associated with sharing certain information, even \nwith members of Congress,\" Young told Seung Min Kim, referring to the closed-\ndoor briefing on Wednesday that left Lee and Paul seething. \"But I left there feeling \nas though it would've been a lot more helpful had I gotten a little peek into some of \nthe intel that informed the operational decisions.\" \nEFTA00032526\n\nU.S. believes Ukraine airliner shot down by Iran \nTHE LATEST ON THE IRAN CRISIS: \n-- In a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iraqi Prime Minister \nAdel Abdul Mandi asked the United States to send a delegation to Iraq to set \nup a mechanism for the \"safe withdrawal of forces from Iraq.\" Sarah Dadouch \nreports: \"The Iraqi prime minister has repeatedly insisted that U.S. troop withdrawal \nwas the only path toward de-escalation. ... According to a statement, Abdul Mandi \nalso shared his objections regarding U.S. forces entering Iraq and American \naircraft flying in Iraqi airspace without the consent of the Iraqi government.\" \n-- The Trump administration hit Iran with more sanctions Friday in the first \nconcrete response to the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq this week. (Carol \nMorello) \n-- Western officials believe an Iranian missile hit the Ukrainian plane that \ncrashed near Tehran earlier this week in a possible unintentional firing. \nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is now asking Western leaders to share with \nhim the intelligence that suggests this. Isabelle Khurshudyan and Erin \nCunningham report: \"Iran, meanwhile, denied the assertions that the Boeing 737, \ncarrying 176 people from Tehran to Kyiv, was shot down early Wednesday shortly \nafter departing from Tehran. ... Ukraine has taken an active role in investigating the \ncrash of the jet, which was carrying 11 Ukrainians, including the crew. A team of 45 \nexperts and search-and-rescue personnel from Ukraine, including specialists who \nhelped investigate the July 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over \nUkrainian territory, arrived in Tehran early Thursday to participate in the probe.... \nZelensky had phone conversations Thursday with heads of government from \nCanada, Britain, Sweden and Iran — countries that each had citizens among the \npassengers. While Ukraine's readouts of those calls said Zelensky intended to \nkeep the leaders abreast of Ukraine's findings and encouraged their \nEFTA00032527\n\ncountries to participate in the investigation, he has now had to publicly ask \nto be briefed in return.... The Ukrainian leader is expected to speak with \n[Pompeo] on Friday.... \n\"In Washington, U.S. officials expressed 'high confidence' that the Boeing \n737-800 was targeted by an SA-15 surface-to-air missile, part of a Russian-\nmade air defense system also known as a Tor system, as Iranian forces were on \nhigh alert. President Trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a \n'mistake.' Then in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said \nintelligence analyses indicated that a surface-to-air missile hit the plane in what \ncould have been an 'unintentional' act.... A Ukrainian official ... said that Zelensky \nmade the public request for evidence about the crash because the United \nStates had not yet shared with Ukraine its intelligence about the missile \nThursday.... \n\"The Washington Post obtained a video that allegedly shows the moment the \nairliner was struck in midair. The video, first published by the New York \nTimes, purportedly shows a missile intercepting the aircraft near the city of \nParand, followed by a loud boom.... Earlier Friday, the Iranian government said \nin a statement that it was inviting Boeing to send a representative to help examine \nthe 'black box' containing the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Iranian state \ntelevision aired a video of an investigator opening and showing the contents of the \nbox.\" \n-- The tragedy mirrors the 1988 Iran Air incident, in which a passenger plane \nthat had originated in the Iranian capital was shot down, leaving 290 \ndead. Adam Taylor reports: \"On July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down by \nthe U.S. military. The flight ... was flying over the Strait of Hormuz toward its \ndestination, Dubai, when it was hit by two surface-to-air missiles. Though Pentagon \nofficials at first denied any knowledge of the incident, it soon emerged that the \nplane had been targeted by the USS Vincennes, a cruiser that had been involved \nin a skirmish with Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf and had mistaken the \nEFTA00032528\n\npassenger jet for an Iranian warplane. President Ronald Reagan expressed \nsympathy for the 'terrible human tragedy' but suggested that the plane had 'failed \nto heed repeated warnings.' However, an investigation by the International Civil \nAviation Organization, a U.N. agency, found that U.S. military ships in the region \ndid not have the equipment necessary to monitor civilian air-traffic-control \nfrequencies.\" \n-- On Fox News last night, Pompeo reiterated that Soleimani planned \"a series \nof imminent attacks.\" Asked for specifics, he added: \"We don't know precisely \nwhen and we don't know precisely where. But it was real.\" \n-- An Iranian military commander said the missiles fired at bases used by \nU.S. troops in Iraq were not intended to inflict casualties. Kareem Fahim and \nSarah Dadouch report: \"'We did not intend to kill,' said Brig. Gen. Amir Ali \nHajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Aerospace Force, according to \nIranian state media. 'We intended to hit the enemy's military machinery.' However, \nhe repeated the government's claim that 'tens of people were killed or wounded.' \nU.S. and Iraqi officials said the strikes caused no casualties.... Iran tried to counter \nthe United States on the diplomatic front Thursday after Trump called on Britain, \nGermany, France, Russia and China to 'break away from the remnants' of the 2015 \nnuclear deal Iran struck with world powers.... British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, \nspeaking with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday, 'underlined the UK's \ncontinued commitment to' the nuclear deal and 'ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear \nproliferation and reduce tensions,' according to a British government statement. \nRouhani also called European Council President Charles Michel asking for a \nresponse to U.S. sanctions, which Rouhani described as 'economic terrorism,' the \nIranian Fars News agency reported. In a statement, Michel emphasized the need \nfor de-escalation in the region.\" \n-- The U.S. strike on Soleimani's convoy last week also killed Abu Mandi al-\nMuhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi paramilitary group, whose death could \nhave far-reaching implications. From Middle East Eye: \"Commanders of Iranian-\nEFTA00032529\n\nbacked armed factions in Iraq tell MEE that with the loss of the two leaders, they \nare now almost paralysed and would be unable to strike the Americans with real \nconsequence.... Muhandis, who since the 1980s has been one of America's most \nwanted men over his involvement in the bombing of the US and French embassies \nin Kuwait, was seen by most Iraqis as Iran's most influential man in the country.... \nAlthough formally stripped of his financial and administrative powers, Muhandis \ncontinued to enjoy great influence over most of the Hashd al-Shaabi's armed \nfactions, with the government unable to regain control over the paramilitary \numbrella group or force Muhandis to implement orders for fear of retaliation.... \nWhile he frustrated the government, it was Muhandis' strong personality, and his \nblatant challenge to it and the rest of his opponents, that so attracted the leaders \nand fighters of the armed factions and kept them revolving around him like moths \nto a flame, following wherever he went.\" \n-- The speed at which the Iran crisis unfolded shows the influence Trump's \nnew team of national security advisers has. From the Journal: \"The group, \nincluding new Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, new chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Mark Milley and new national security adviser Robert O'Brien, along with \n[Pompeo], backed the president's decision to kill the top Iranian military \ncommander and moved swiftly to carry it out. The new team was cohesive and less \ninclined than its predecessors to push back against the president's wishes, \naccording to administration officials and others consulted by the White House. \nThey also were less likely to consult in advance with other administration, \nPentagon or State Department officials, congressional leaders or foreign allies, \nsome of these officials said.\" \n-- Informants in Iraq and Syria helped the United States kill Soleimani. From \nReuters: \"Soleimani arrived at the Damascus airport in a vehicle with dark-tinted \nglass.... They parked near a staircase leading to a Cham Wings Airbus A320, \ndestined for Baghdad. Neither Soleimani nor the soldiers were registered on the \npassenger manifesto. ... The passenger flight would be Soleimani's last.... \nEFTA00032530\n\nInvestigators have focused on how suspected informants inside the Damascus and \nBaghdad airports collaborated with the U.S. military to help track and pinpoint \nSoleimani's position.... The suspects include two security staffers at the Baghdad \nairport and two Cham Wings employees. ... The National Security agency's \ninvestigators believe the four suspects, who have not been arrested, worked as \npart of a wider group of people feeding information to the U.S. military, the official \nsaid.\" \n-- For Trump and Iran, Twitter trolling helped escalate tensions on the \nbattlefield. David Nakamura reports: \"A day after [Trump] signaled he would not \nuse military force to escalate a tense standoff with Iran, that nation's supreme \nleader responded with a message of his own: a doctored photo of Trump's face \nimprinted with red welts from a slap to the face. The creation on the official website \nof Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered a trolling visual meme to echo his previous \nwarning that Tehran's missile attack on two Iraqi facilities housing U.S. troops was \nonly the first salvo in a campaign to avenge the drone killing of [Soleimani.] \nExperts called the display an example of a new era in international diplomacy in \nwhich official letters, telephone hotlines and secure video conference calls have \nbeen replaced, in some cases, by high-octane and instantaneous social media \nmessaging.\" \n-- Notable commentary from The Post's opinion page: \n•  Jim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and \nsecretary of the Navy under Reagan: \"When did it become \nacceptable to kill a top leader of a country we aren't even at war \nwith?\" \n•  Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI: \"If you think \nIran is done retaliating, think again.\" \n•  Fareed Zakaria: \"Trump does not have a foreign policy.

(Our live blog has more.) \nEFTA00032532\n\n-- The Senate has conducted 15 impeachment trials in U.S. history. It has \nheard witnesses in every single one. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of \nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, reviews the history: \"Only 19 \nother individuals besides Trump have been impeached by the House of \nRepresentatives. The Senate completed a trial in 15 of those cases, and in every \nsingle one of them, it heard testimony from witnesses. Those cases include the \nonly two prior instances in which a president was impeached.\" \n-- House Republicans are eyeing a push to condemn Pelosi for delaying the \ntrial. From Politico: \"GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, who is running for an Alabama \nSenate seat, introduced a censure resolution on Thursday morning to rebuke \nPelosi for hanging on to the articles of impeachment since December. Republicans \nhave the option to force a floor vote on the measure though Democrats would \nsurely move to table it, just as they did with a censure resolution against\" Schiff. \n-- Meanwhile, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tweeted an impeachment-related \nfundraising appeal that included a doctored photo of Pelosi, drawing a \nretweet from Trump. Felicia Sonmez reports: \"The tweet marks the second time \nthis week that a House Republican has tweeted a photo that appears to have been \nmanipulated. On Monday, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted a fake photo of \nObama with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. ... The tweet shows a close-up, \nred-tinted photo of Pelosi, with the lines in the House speaker's face exaggerated \ndue to the image's unnaturally high contrast.\" \nle:Matt Golsteyn is pictured in his D.C. office with his wife Julie and \ntheir infant son Henry. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) \nMatt Golsteyn is pictured in his D.C. office with his wife Julie and their infant son Henry. (Sarah L. \nVoisin/The Washington Post) \n-- An Army general denied a request by an officer pardoned by Trump in an \nopen murder case to have his Special Forces tab reinstated. Dan Lamothe \nEFTA00032533\n\nreports: \"The decoration for retired Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was denied Dec. \n3 by Lt. Gen. Francis M. Beaudette, the commander of U.S. Army Special \nOperations Command, the Army disclosed Thursday. Beaudette's decision is not \nfinal, and the service said in a statement that it will next have an administrative \npanel consider whether it should reinstate the Special Forces tab and a \nDistinguished Service Cross — the U.S. military's second-highest valor award —\nand expunge a letter of reprimand Golsteyn received in connection with his case. \nGolsteyn was awaiting trial this year in the alleged murder of a suspected Taliban \nbombmaker in Marja, Afghanistan, in February 2010. ... The general's denial of \nGolsteyn's reinstatement request follows Trump's decision in November to pardon \nGolsteyn along with former 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, an Army officer who had been \nconvicted of murder in Afghanistan. ... Golsteyn, reached for comment Thursday \nevening, said he had not heard about the decision until it was first reported by The \nWashington Post. A few minutes later, he and his lawyer, Phil Stackhouse, said \nthey received notification from the Army in an emailed letter that had just arrived.\" \n-- The Justice Department is winding down the Hillary Clinton-related inquiry \nonce championed by Trump. It found nothing of consequence. Devlin Barrett \nand Matt Zapotosky report: \"John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, was tapped in \nNovember 2017 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to look into concerns \nraised by Trump and his allies in Congress that the FBI had not fully pursued cases \nof possible corruption at the Clinton Foundation and during Clinton's time as \nsecretary of state, when the U.S. government decided not to block the sale of a \ncompany called Uranium One. As a part of his review, Huber examined documents \nand conferred with federal law enforcement officials in Little Rock who were \nhandling a meandering probe into the Clinton Foundation. ... Current and former \nofficials said that Huber has largely finished and found nothing worth pursuing —\nthough the assignment has not formally ended and no official notice has been sent \nto the Justice Department or to lawmakers.\" \nEFTA00032534\n\n-- Internal Boeing documents show employees discussing efforts to \nmanipulate U.S. and international safety regulators. Ian Duncan, Lori Aratani \nand Michael Laris report: \"'Yes, I still haven't been forgiven by god for the covering \nup I did last year,\" said a 2018 message. Another exchange between Boeing \nemployees, from August 2015, closes out with this: 'I know but this is what these \nregulators get when they try and get in the way. they impede progress. ...' In 2017, \na Boeing employee wrote: 'this airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn \nare supervised by monkeys.' The documents were released by Boeing to \ncongressional investigators probing how the company's 737 Max jets were certified \nby the Federal Aviation Administration as safe before two crashes that killed 346 \npeople.... \n\"At issue in some of the messages was whether simulator training should be \nrequired for pilots flying the Max. Boeing went to great lengths to prevent \nsuch a requirement, in part because it would be costly for its customers, \ncompany documents show. ... In one November 2015 message, the 737 chief \ntechnical pilot, whose name is redacted in the documents, said failing to get \ncomputer-based training for one system 'is a planet-killer for the MAX.' ... In \nanother email chain, from June 2017, the chief technical pilot forwarded to Boeing \ncolleagues messages in which he persuaded an airline, which is not identified in \nthe documents, not to require simulator training on the Max. 'Looks like my jedi \nmind trick worked again!' the pilot wrote. 'These are not the droids you're looking \nfor.' ... In a shift Tuesday, the company said that it is recommending that pilots \nundergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 Max. The FAA, which \nwill have the final say, said it will consider Boeing's recommendation.\" (Read the \nBoeing documents for yourself here.) \n-- The United States economy added 145,000 jobs in December as the \nunemployment rate remained at 3.5 percent. (Rachel Siegel) \n-- Video from Jeffrey Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt was lost due to \n\"technical errors,\" according to prosecutors. Reis Thebault reports: \"Federal \nEFTA00032535\n\nprosecutors said in December they were unable to locate the video, which would \nhave showed guards finding Epstein after his first apparent suicide attempt in July. \nThen, just a day later, they wrote in a court filing that they had found the footage \nand were 'in the process of obtaining a copy' from the Metropolitan Correctional \nCenter in New York City, where Epstein was held. But on Thursday, prosecutors \nreversed themselves again, saying the video 'no longer exists' because of \n'technical errors.' Jail officials initially thought they had saved footage from outside \nEpstein's cell, when in fact the footage they preserved was from a different part of \nthe facility, explained Assistant U.S. Attorneys and Jason \nSwergold in the latest filing.\" \n-- Border crossings are starting to plateau as U.S. officials report a continued \ndecline in immigration apprehensions. Abigail Hauslohner reports: \"The number \nof people apprehended or deemed 'inadmissible' by U.S. border authorities along \nthe southern border fell to 40,620 last month, down 72 percent from May, when the \nTrump administration declared it was at the height of a border crisis. December \nmarked the seventh straight month of decline in border crossings, but the month-\nto-month differences have shrunk significantly since September. Border \nenforcement actions last month were roughly on par with December 2017.\" \n-- Counties, cities and states are stepping up on their climate goals as the \nTrump administration steps back. Rebecca Tan reports: \"Maryland's most \npopulous jurisdiction is promising an ambitious package of new climate initiatives in \n2020, joining other liberal counties, cities and states stepping up to address what \nthey see as the Trump administration's resistance to protecting the planet.... In \nFebruary, Montgomery will hold a town hall on hundreds of recommendations from \nclimate workgroups convened last year by County Executive Marc Elrich (D). And \nby early 2021, officials hope to unveil a comprehensive plan detailing how the \ncounty will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2027 and 100 \npercent by 2035.\" \nEFTA00032536\n\nAmerican sprinters Tommie Smith (center) and John Carlos (right) \nraise their gloved fists in a civil rights protest at the 1968 Olympic \nGames in Mexico City.

(AP) \nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER: \n-- Gag rule alert: The International Olympic Committee warned athletes they \nwould face sanctions, which could include the loss of medals, for \nparticipating in political protests during the Olympics in Tokyo this summer, \nincluding kneeling, political hand gestures and wearing or holding signs or \narmbands. Jacob Bogage reports: \"The committee published a three-page \ndocument of guidelines. ... 'We needed clarity, and they wanted clarity on the \nrules,' [said] Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, chair of the IOC Athletes' Commission, \nwhich helped create the new document. ... The guidelines outlaw demonstrations \nsuch as those staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, American sprinters who \nraised their gloved fists on the medal stand at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, and \nformer NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began kneeling during the \nnational anthem. Both demonstrations sought to draw attention to racial injustice \nand have been repeated by other athletes in recent years.... \n\"Ethiopian runner Feyisa Lilesa crossed his wrists at the finish line of the \nmen's marathon at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro to show support for \ncivil rights protesters in his home country. Americans Race Imboden, a fencer, \nand hammer-thrower Gwen Berry were placed on probation by the U.S. Olympic \nand Paralympic Committee in August after demonstrating on the medal stand at \nthe Pan American Games. Imboden knelt during the national anthem, while Berry \nraised a fist. Athletes who protest will face discipline 'on a case-by-case basis as \nnecessary,' according to the guidelines.\" \nEFTA00032537\n\n-- A billion animals have been caught in Australia's fires. Some may go \nextinct. Karin Brulliard and Darryl Fears report: \"The mouse-size dunnart is not as \niconic as the koalas or platypuses that draw tourists, but it is arguably the most \nspecial mammal on Australia's Kangaroo Island. Now the Kangaroo Island \ndunnart's days may be numbered. Before bush fires struck, it was already \nendangered, so rare that even researchers who studied them had never seen one. \nNow they fear they never will. One-third of the 1,700-square-mile island has \nburned, including the entire area where these dunnarts are known to live. ... More \nthan 1 billion mammals, birds and reptiles nationwide — some of them found \nnowhere else on Earth — may have been affected or killed by the fires sweeping \nacross Australia, according to a University of Sydney estimate. The potential toll is \nfar greater when other types of animals are included. ... Individual animals might \nsurvive, but when their habitat is gone, 'it doesn't matter,' Saunders said. 'They'll \ndie anyway.'\" \n-- Disgusting: Hoaxers are using the fires to spread misinformation and \nprofit, Brittany Shammas reports. \n-- The fire crisis is fueling protests calling for bolder action on climate \nchange. Kate Shuttleworth reports: \"At rallies nationwide on Friday, thousands \ncalled for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to resign over what they say is his \nadministration's passivity on an issue that has hit home to millions of Australians as \na clear and present danger. The conservative leader has defended his disaster \nresponse after facing criticism from victims and firefighters for its perceived \ninadequacy. In Melbourne, close to 10,000 people took to the streets, spurning \ncalls from police and the state's center-left leader, Daniel Andrews, not to risk \ndiverting emergency resources. ... An organizer of a similar rally in Sydney, Gavin \nStanbrook, said the events of recent weeks revealed a nation polarized over how \nto tackle the challenge. 'We are divided between coal interests and politicians on \nthe one side and then firefighters and volunteers on the other and the rest of us \nwho are either impacted or our friends and family are on the front line, or in cities \nEFTA00032538\n\nsurrounded by smoke,' Stanbrook said. 'We need to come together and say that \nwe will not accept it anymore.'\" \n-- Suspected Islamist militants killed 25 soldiers in Niger. Danielle Paquette \nreports: \"The clash unfolded in the western village of Chinegodar near the border \nwith Mali, according to Nigerien defense officials, as fighters with ties to the Islamic \nState and al-Qaeda look to seize new swaths of territory. The bloodshed came \nabout a month after gunmen ambushed a Nigerien army post in another border \ntown, killing 71 soldiers in the deadliest strike on the nation's forces in recent \nmemory. The Islamic State West Africa Province asserted responsibility for that \nmassacre two days later.\" \n-- In Israel, deadly floods have kept residents confined to their homes and \noffices even as they braced for potential spinoff attacks from rising tensions \nbetween the United States and Iran. Steve Hendrix reports: \"Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu on Thursday beseeched citizens to take flood warnings as \nseriously as they do the sirens warning of imminent rocket fire that are a feature of \nlife in many Israeli communities.... Netanyahu also warned the adventurous not to \nventure out to the desert to witness the dramatic — and potentially dangerous —\nspectacle of dry stream beds reanimated with roaring water. 'Watch them on \ntelevision,' he advised.... Officials said rescue resources had been redeployed \nnationwide in response to the flooding, which stretched from the coastal plains \nalong the Mediterranean to the occupied West Bank down to the Dead Sea.\" \n-- China identified a new strain of coronavirus as the source of its \npneumonia outbreak. Gerry Shih and Lena H. Sun report: \"A group of Chinese \nexperts this week isolated and obtained the genome sequence of the new virus, \nwhich is believed to be responsible for sickening dozens of people who visited a \nwild-animal market last month in Wuhan, in central China, state media reported \nThursday. The outbreak ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season in China has \nprompted health authorities across East Asia to increase screening of travelers for \nsigns of fever, underscoring fears about its potential spread.\" \nEFTA00032539\n\n-- Understatement of the year? Pope Francis said 2020 is off to a rough start, \nsaying it \"does not seem to be marked by encouraging signs.\" Chico Harlan \nreports: \"While saying that maintaining hope is essential, the pope spent the next \n45 minutes talking about wars and could-be wars, exploitation, sexual abuse, \nInternet hate speech, international indifference to humanitarian crises, and the \ndepressing state of the world's fight against climate change. He called heightened \ntensions between the United States and Iran 'particularly troubling,' but his remarks \namounted to a laundry list of flash points, both major and obscure, from Burkina \nFaso to Venezuela to Australia. 'Certainly, hope has to be realistic,' Francis said. 'It \ndemands acknowledging the many troubling issues confronting our world and the \nchallenges lurking on the horizon. It requires that problems be called by their name \nand the courage be found to resolve them.\" \n-- Lebanon has banned ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn from traveling. Sarah \nDadouch reports: \"Ghosn appeared at a hearing in Lebanon on Thursday, two days \nafter Lebanon's caretaker justice minister, Albert Serhan, said the country's public \nprosecutor had received the Interpol red notice about Ghosn and would be taking \nthe necessary steps. He was placed under house arrest. A few days after his \narrival in Lebanon's capital, Ghosn found himself in more legal trouble: A group of \nlawyers last Thursday lodged a legal complaint against him for visiting Israel as \nchairman of Renault and later Nissan. Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of \nwar for the past six decades, and Lebanese law considers interacting with the \ncountry's southern neighbor and sworn enemy a crime. Ali Abbas, one of the two \nlawyers who filed the Israel-related complaint against Ghosn, said the travel ban \nwas a formality that usually comes after receiving Interpol notices, especially red \nnotices, which alert police about internationally wanted fugitives but do not compel \nany country to arrest the fugitive.\" \n-- Trump wished North Korean leader Kim Jung Un a happy birthday through \nSouth Korea. \n(AP) \nEFTA00032540\n\n-- A statue mocking Trump in Melania Trump's home country was burned \ndown. Lateshia Beachum reports: \"Firefighters in Moravce, a city in central \nSlovenia, tried to extinguish the bonfire, but their efforts left charred planks on the \nground. The arsonists responsible for the Christmas nutcracker-like statue's ashes \nare reportedly still at large. The nearly 26-foot tall wooden structure that had a \nmechanism to open Trump's red painted mouth full of pointy teeth was constructed \nlast year in a nation divided over the U.S. president. The statue of Trump, with the \npresident's signature blue suit and red tie, had been under torch threats since local \nresidents threatened to set it ablaze on Halloween ... It was relocated because of \nthe risk.\" \n-- London's Madame Tussauds removed its wax figures of Prince Harry and \nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex, from its display of Britain's royal family less \nthan 24 hours after the couple announced they would be \"stepping back\" \nfrom their roles as senior royals. Jennifer Hassan reports: \"The figures will no \nlonger stand alongside the rest of the royal family. They have been moved by the \nwax museum's staff. The likenesses of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, \nWilliam and Catherine, remain on display alongside figures of Queen Elizabeth II \nand her husband, Prince Philip. 'As two of our most popular and well-loved figures, \nthey will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as \nwe watch to see what the next chapter holds for them,' said [Steve Davies, general \nmanager of Madame Tussauds London].\" \nLA/ice President Pence, along with White House senior adviser \nJared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, and their children, \nArabella, Joseph and Theodore Kushner, attend a Hanukkah \nreception in the East Room of the White House last month.

'They're legal agreements, and for all I know the other side \nwouldn't want to get out of it.'

David \nWeigel reports: \"Steyer, who has spent more than $115 million on his campaign so \nfar, hit 12 percent in the network's poll of Nevada ... and 15 percent in South \nCarolina.... It came after Steyer poured more than $20 million into commercials \nand other advertising in these states as of this week, with $11.2 million worth of \nEFTA00032542\n\nexpenditures in South Carolina and $10.3 million in Nevada. He has also spent \nheavily to attract hundreds of thousands of small-dollar donations, which the DNC \nrequires for debate access.\" \n-- The Fox News Nevada poll also shows Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \nvying for the lead in the state: \"Biden tops Sanders by 23-17 percent among \nDemocratic caucusgoers, with both down one percentage point since November. \n[Elizabeth] Warren comes in at 12 percent, down from 18 percent — and ties with \n[Steyer] for third.\" \n-- A new Monmouth Poll shows a four-way fight in the New Hampshire \nDemocratic primary: \"Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and \nunaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic \nprimary, 20% currently support [Pete] Buttigieg, 19% back Biden, 18% back \nSanders, and 15% back Warren.... Compared to Monmouth's last New Hampshire \npoll in September, Buttigieg's support has grown by 10 points (from 10%) and \nSanders' support has increased by 6 points (from 12%).

From the Los Angeles \nTimes: \"Garcetti will be one of Biden's highest-profile supporters in California's \nMarch 3 primary, but the endorsement is unlikely to have any practical effect on the \nhighly competitive race.
