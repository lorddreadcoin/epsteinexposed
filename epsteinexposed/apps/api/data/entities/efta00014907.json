I am having a good time although I miss you and the Office, and I am still trying to figure out \nwhat to do with my brunches now that Heights Café / Giulia's is for-real gone. \nI have a special request. I am a massive fan, having done the retrial with her back in the \nday. And my partner and former Office guy is one of her mentors and counts himself a massive fan also. We \nweren't able to be there for the opening yesterday. We'd love a transcript. Can you get us one? \nThanks, \nm \nMartin S. Bell \n(bio)\nSim pson Thacher & Bartlett LLP \nEFTA00014907",
