The overlay file contains the production number, file name and the \nMD5 Hash. Please let me know if there are any questions. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 26, 2021 10:46 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: another Maxwell issue \n< \nThank you! The issue with production 11 is that defense counsel has expressed difficulty reviewing the metadata on the \nimages contained in the production. In particular, the FBI created the attached spreadsheet, which listed the metadata \nthe FBI was able to extract from the images, but defense counsel has indicated they have no way of knowing which bates \nnumbered image in the production corresponds with which row in the spreadsheet. I'm hoping there's something in the \nproduction we can point them to that will help them match up each bates number with each row in the spreadsheet. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 26, 2021 10:33 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: another Maxwell issue \n3 PM would be fine.
