She is in a local facility in New Hampshire now, and will be presented virtually at 3:30.

I've recently taken on a new role as Counsel to the US Attorney. As you probably saw, Ghislaine \nMaxwell was arrested today in New Hampshire. We expect her to consent to detention pending her transport to SDNY. I \nwas hoping to talk to the right person to ensure appropriate precautions are being taken for her safety, particularly given \nthe history here. Would that be you, or is there someone else I should connect with? \nThanks so much, \nCounsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00016176",
