(He also appears to have reorganized the structure of his assets also on August 8 — see the \nreferences to the \"1953 Trust\" apparently established on that date; note that 1953 is the year he was born.) \nIn terms of other useful information, for all the cloak and dagger about who the executor was, it turns out it's his two \nmain lawyers, Indyke and Kahn, who handle virtually all of his business activities (and of whom we were already well \naware). It appears that those executors have the ability to deal with claims against the estate or its assets. \nAs for where his assets actually go, it all goes to the \"acting Trustees of the 1953 Trust\" — i.e., nobody is named herein. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 14:20 \nTo: \nCc: \nEFTA00019322\n\nSubject: RE: US v Epstein \nSure — I just emailed them to ask. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 14:17 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: US v Epstein \nCan we ask for copies? \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 17, 2019, at 2:08 PM, wrote: \nFYI below, re: probating the estate.
