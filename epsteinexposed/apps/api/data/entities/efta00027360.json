NATHAN, District Judge: \nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy \nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a \nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy \nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting \nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges \nof perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. \nOn July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant \nwas a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her \nappearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2020, the Defendant filed a renewed \nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December \n14, 2020. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2020, the Court denied that motion, concluding that \nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her \nappearance. Dkt. Nos. 104, 106. \nThe Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2021. Dkt. \nNo. 160. In this motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the reasons that the Court \n1 \nEFTA00027360\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 2 of 12 \nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her \nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship, \nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse's assets placed in a new account that will be \nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. 160 at 2. \nAs set forth below, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant's new arguments and \nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no \ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the \nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant's first and second motions for release, the \nCourt DENIES the Defendant's third motion for release on bail. \nI. Background \nOn July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant's request for bail. \nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant's arguments and of the factors set forth in \n18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could \nreasonably assure the Defendant's appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a \nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). The \nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. \nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2020. The Court \nagain denied the Defendant's motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the \nDefendant's new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of \nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry \nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, \nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant's \nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for \n2 \nEFTA00027361\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 3 of 12 \nescape; and that the Defendant's lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations \nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court. \nSee Dkt. No. 106. \nOn February 23, 2021, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No. \n160 (\"Def. Mot.\"). The Government opposed the Defendant's motion on March 9, 2021. Dkt. \nNo. 165 (\"Gov't Opp'n\"). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March 16, \n2021. \nIL Legal Standard \nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from \ngranting the Defendant's third bail motion while Defendant's bail appeal is pending. See Gov't \nOpp'n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) \n(\"As a general matter, 'the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over \nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\") (citation omitted). Under Rule 37(a) of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer \nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court \nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P. \n37(a). Because \nthe Court denies the Defendant's motion, it does not resolve the question of \nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it. \nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq. The Bail Reform Act \nrequires that a court release a defendant \"subject to the least restrictive further condition, or \ncombination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the \n3 \nEFTA00027362\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 4 of 12 \nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\" 18 U.S.C. § \n3142(c)(1)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after \nconsidering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that \"no condition \nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and \nthe safety of any other person and the community.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). \nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can \nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the \nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if \"information exists that was not known to the movant at the \ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue\" of whether pretrial detention is \nwarranted. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0. The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new \ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No. \n18-CR-204I (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018) (noting that \n\"[als the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another\"); United States v. \nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing \nbecause the new information would not have changed the court's decision to detain the defendant \nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent \nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(0's statutory text. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) \n(noting that \"a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on \nreconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing.\"); United States v. \nPetrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the \n\"Court's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision\"). \n4 \nEFTA00027363\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 5 of 12 \nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense \nspecifically enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises \"that no condition or \ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure\" the defendant's appearance or the safety of the \ncommunity or others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). In such circumstances, \"the defendant `bears a \nlimited burden of production ... to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that \nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.' United States v.  English, 629 \nF.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. \n2001)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"[A] defendant must \nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.\"). \nNonetheless, \"'the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing \nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,' and `by the lesser standard of a \npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.' English, 629 F.3d at \n319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Mardi., 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 \n(2d Cir. 1986) (\"The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].\"). \nEven when \"a defendant has met his burden of production,\" however, \"the presumption favoring \ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed \nby the district court.\" United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290-91 (2d Cir. 2020). \nIII. Discussion \nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court's inherent powers to review \nits own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of \nthe Court's earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the \nGovernment's case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, \nwhich are currently pending before the Court. Id. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the \n5 \nEFTA00027364\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 6 of 12 \nCourt's view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no \nset of conditions, including the Defendant's third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to \nreasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the \nevidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that \nconclusion. The Defendant's proposed conditions do not alter the Court's determination. \nA. The Court's assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors has not changed \nTo begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force. \nSee Dkt. No. 106 (\"Dec. Op.\") at 7—8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant \nhas met her burden of production, the presumption \"remains a factor to be considered among \nthose weighed by the district court.\" Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at \n1144). The Court is mindful \"that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of \nflight, and that `a strong probability arises' that no form of conditional release will be adequate \nto secure their appearance.\" Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted). \nThe Court's analysis of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors also remains unchanged. \nBecause the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor \nvictim, the first 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention. \nAnd the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or \nto the community. The fourth § 3142(g) factor thus weighs against detention. \nWith respect to the second § 3142(g) factor, none of the Defendant's new arguments alter \nthe Court's conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial \nmotions \"raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire \nindictment,\" and she contends that \"[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength \n6 \nEFTA00027365\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 7 of 12 \nof the government's case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.\" Def. Mot. at 7. \nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court. The \nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated \nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the \npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength \nand nature of the Government's case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec. \nOp. \nat 9-10. \nThe Court's assessment of the Defendant's history and characteristics has not changed. \nSee Dec. Op. at 10-16. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial \nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading \ndetection. Id. at 10-11. And the Court's concerns regarding the Defendant's lack of candor \nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court \nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the \ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information \npresented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op. \nat 16. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant's willingness to abide by any set of \nconditions of release. Id. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in \nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant's family ties in the United States, these do not \novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention. \nAs a result, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter \nthe Court's assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to \nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion \n7 \nEFTA00027366\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 8 of 12 \nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there \nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings. \nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted \nThe thrust of the Defendant's argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new \nproposed conditions vitiate the Court's concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first \noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to \nhave most of her and her spouse's assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a \nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority \nover the account. Id. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed \nin December. See Dec. Op. at 16-17; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not \ndisturb the Court's conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of showing that these \nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set \nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance. \nThe Court begins with the Defendant's offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom \ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship \"immediately upon granting of \nbail,\" and she informs the Court that \"[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while \nnot immediate, may be expedited.\" Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of \nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear. \nSee Gov't Opp'n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is \nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The \nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of \nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that \"the fact that the wanted individual is a French \nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,\" and that \"[a]s long as said \n8 \nEFTA00027367\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 9 of 12 \nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent \nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said \nassessment of nationality.\"' Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the \nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the \nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 11. The Defendant's expert concedes that there is no \ncase law addressing this precise issue. Id. ¶ 21. \nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend \nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between \nthe United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that \"[t]here is no obligation upon the \nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but \nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the \nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person \nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.\" See Reply, \nEx. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly \nprovides that \"Extradition shall not be granted ... [w]hen the person claimed has French \nnationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is \nrequested!' Id. ¶ 10; see also Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty \nas to the relevance of the Defendant's offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her \nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court's assessment of the risks largely \n'  The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French. \n2  Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides' respective translations. The \ntranslated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, \"When the individual \nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the \noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.\" Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. \n9 \nEFTA00027368\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 10 of 12 \nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition \nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at 12-13. \nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant's offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The \nCourt is persuaded by the Government's arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce \nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See \nGov't Opp'n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the \nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court's concerns regarding the \nDefendant's ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition attempts. The \npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the \nDefendant's incentive to flee. \nTo summarize, the Defendant's willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship \ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court's concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant \nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the \nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court's assessment of \nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, \nNo. \nC 10-00547 (SI), \n2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20,2010). And that same uncertainty—and the \npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes \nflight, particularly because of the Defendant's substantial international ties. \nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court's determination that no \ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. The \nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial \naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve \ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have \n10 \nEFTA00027369\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 11 of 12 \nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant's assets have been disclosed in light of \nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of \nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it \naccounts for all of the Defendant's and her spouse's assets. See Dec. Op. at 16-17. \nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant's future appearance, \neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant's bail package. The Defendant \nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to \nevade prosecution. These include the $450,000 that the Defendant would retain for living \nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry \nand other chattels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at \n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the \nDefendant's total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate \nflight. When combined with the Court's weighing of the § 3142(g) factors and the presumption \nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its \nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance. \nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the \nDefendant's future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package \nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again \ndetermines that \"no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the \nappearance of the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. 18 U.S.C. § \n3142(e)(1). \n11 \nEFTA00027370\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 12 of 12 \nIV.
