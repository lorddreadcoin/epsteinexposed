We need to spend some time together on the indictment. I was planning on Monday because I thought you were \nback that day but if you're already back let me know. By the way, I. and Alex have been very clear that we are not negotiating with this \nguy any more in any way. \n-nut. \n----Original Message--\nFrom: \n(USAFLS) \nSent: Tuesday, May 27, 2008 2:54 PM \nTo: (USAFLS); \nCc: \n(USAFLS) \nSubject: Epstein \n(USAFLS) \nsent me an email about epstein wanting to do less time. I hope that his request will be denied. The original deal was \nsupposed to be 2 years so he has already gotten a big break. Plus we have identified more victims since we agreed to the 18 months. Please \nkeep me posted. Thanks. \nEFTA00013920",
