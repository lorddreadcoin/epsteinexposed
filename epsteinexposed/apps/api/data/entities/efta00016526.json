Epstein (SW Returns) - Potentially Non-Responsive - https://dlpe.nss.pae.com/Relativityjgo?id=2370462-4350955 \nCan you also please confirm that the Potentially Non-Responsive data will be placed in two subfolders under the following \nparent folders: \nal Search Warrant \nReturns \n4— \nd \nNew_Search Warrant Returns_F8I \n4- USvE_20200728 \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, December 4, 2020 10:55 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \n[Contractor] < \nEFTA00016526\n\nCc: \n*cl>; \nSubject: Request re Maxwell Relativity \n(USANYS) \nNow that we have completed our responsiveness review in the \"US v Epstein (SW Returns)\" database, we need to lock off \naccess to any non-responsive materials in that database. Would it be possible to please lock off access to the 397,365 \ndocuments in that database that are NOT currently tagged \"Identified Responsive\"? That should leave just the 1,218,719 \ndocuments that are tagged \"Identified Responsive\" accessible to the team for use in our case. \nHappy to have a call to discuss if that would be useful. \nThanks very \nmuch, \nEFTA00016527",
