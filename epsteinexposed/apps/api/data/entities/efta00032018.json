Basically she's getting a draft later this afternoon that we can review \nthen. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, April 29, 2021 10:32 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \n(USANYS) < \n>; \n(USANYS) ‹> \n) \n) \n• > \nCc: \nSubject: \n(USANYS) \nWe're working on drafting a letter in response to the attached, and wanted to give you a heads up. We hope to have a \ndraft for you this afternoon, in the hopes of sending the draft to defense counsel tonight as part of the meet-and-confer \ndirected by Judge Nathan. I think that leaves sufficient time for filing tomorrow. \nAlthough we're mindful of third party privacy interests, for non-parties who are neither witnesses nor victims in the case, I \ndo have concerns about entertaining redaction/intervention requests, given the high volume of people who may ask to be \nheard or assert a right to review and redact documents if this were entertained. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00032018",
