And of course as always we're happy to address \nany questions that you or she might have in advance. \nthanks very much, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThe information contained in this electronic message is confidential information intended only for the use of the named recipient(s) and may contain information \nthat. among other protections. is the subject of attorney-client privilege. attorney work product or exempt from disclosure under applicable law. \nlithe \nreader of this \nelectronic message is not the named recipient. or the employee or agent responsible to deliver it to the named recipient. you are hereby notified that any \ndissemination. distribution. copying or other use of this communication is strictly prohibited and no privilege is waived.
