Time, Last Name Unknown \n(LNU), email address , who resides in Virginia Beach, \nVA, Internet Protocol (I?) address ,  which resolves to \nVirginia Beach, VA 23464, submitted an online tip to the FBI National \nThreat Operations Center (NT0C) via tips.fbi.gov, to report a sexual \nencounter with Jeffrey Epstein when she was 15 years old. \nDate Submitted: 08/11/2020 07:26:56 AM ET \nTransaction Number: 0B153A14-9B5A-425F-ACAB-46CC624AD735 \nThreat To Life: False \nSubmitted Text: \nHi, my name is \nI think I may have been a victim by jeffrey epstein. I was about 15 at \nthe time. My friend said we could make some quick money just by giving a \nmassage. So we met with her friend who his name was Andy. When we went I \nsat down while she went inside the bedroom. She came out & Andy said he \nwanted me to come in. When I  walked in there was another man sitting on \nI don't know who I need to talk to about this but \nUNCLASSIFIED \nEFTA00020481\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY-3027571, 08/11/2020 \nthe bed which made me even made hesitate to go in but I went in. I gave a \nquick massage to a man who looks very much like him. Then he proceeded to \ntake my clothes off without my \npermission. All I remember is getting \ntouched, touching a \nman,& then having a \non me. After \nit was all \ndone he gave us money & we left. I'm really \ntrying to remember if it was \nhim or \nnot since I've blocked absolutely so much of those years out of my \nhead. But he looks so familiar & that voice of his as well.Not only that \nbut months later Andy drives by the place \nI \nstayed at & asked me was \nthere anyone in the \ngovernment or law enforcement looking for him. He \nsaid that he was part of a thing with a powerful man & he has to get out \nof town if they were looking for him. I told him they weren't which it \nwas the case. I know Andy & other men he knew would give girls \nbut mostly \nRussian girls places to stay & help them with \nwork. Much of that work was \nprostitution for rich men that Andy pimped them out to. So I am hoping \nyou can help me figure out if I was \nEpstein victims by answering some \nquestions so I can piece it together. Such as could you please tell me if \nyou have proof that jeffrey \nepstein was in Virginia Beach,Virginia in the \n2000's? Did Epstein have Russian girls in Virginia Beach, Virginia? Do \nyou have a \nVirginia Beach home address on file for him that I could \nverify back to you? Finally has the name Andy \never come up in ur files \nthat's related to Epstein in anyway? \nIf \nyou would be so kind to email me \nback it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \nViolation: Other \nViolation Questions \nWhat was the exact crime that occurred?: It's about Jeffery Epstein \nWhen did the crime/incident occur?
