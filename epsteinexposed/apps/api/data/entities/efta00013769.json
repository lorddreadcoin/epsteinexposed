They contend that Epstein —\nfriend of the rich and famous and financial \npatron of Democratic Party organizations \nand candidates — committed those acts \nwith five underage girls. \nIn the past week, New York Attorney \nGeneral and gubernatorial candidate Eliot \nSpitzer has returned about $50,000 in \ncampaign contributions he received from \nEpstein, and Mark Green, a candidate to \nreplace Spitzer in his current job, has \nreturned $10,000 to him because of \nthe \nPalm Beach scandal, the New York Daily \nNews has \nreported. \nhttp://palmbeachpost.printthis.clickability.corn/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Ignorance+of+age+... 1/2/2008 \nEFTA00013769\n\nIgnorance of age not valid defense in sex cases, expert says Page 2 of 3 \nLatest breaking news, photos and all of today's Post \nstories. \nRather than file charges, the state attorney's \nShare This Story \noffice presented the case to a county grand \njury. The panel indicted Epstein last week \non a single, less serious charge of felony solicitation of prostitution. \nThe case raised eyebrows because the state attorney's office rarely, if ever, kicks such charges to a grand \njury. And it increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases, especially when the defendant \nis enormously wealthy and can hire high-priced, top-tier lawyers. \nAt least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew she was underage when the two of them got \nnaked for massages and sexual activity. She was 16 years old at the time and said Epstein asked her \nquestions about her high school, according to \npolice reports. \nA girl who said she met Epstein when she was 15 said he told her if she told anybody what happened at \nhis house, bad things could happen, the police reports state. \nEpstein's youngest alleged victim was 14 when she says she gave him a massage that included some \nsexual activity. She is now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Epstein her age. \n\"My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrassment,\" he said. \"But \nshe very much looked 14. Any prudent man would have had second thoughts about that.\" \nDefense attorney Jack Goldberger maintains that not only did Epstein pass a polygraph test showing he \ndid not know the girls were minors, but their stories weren't credible. The state attorney's office also \nimplied that their credibility was an issue when it decided not to charge Epstein directly, but instead give \nthe case to the grand jury. \n\"A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion,\" a state attorney's spokesman said last week. \nEpstein hired Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz when he became aware he was under \ninvestigation, and Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the alleged victims had spoke \nof using alcohol and marijuana on a popular Web site, according to a Palm Beach police report. \nProsecutors typically consider two things in deciding whether to charge somebody with sex-related \noffenses against minors — whether there is sufficient evidence and whether there is a public interest in \ndoing so, Dekle said. \nIf two teens are in a sexual relationship and the boy turns 18 before the girl, he could be charged with a \nsex crime if the sex continues. There would be no public interest in pursuing that, Dekle said. \nBut where there is a large gap in ages — and especially in cases of teachers with students — there is a \npublic interest in prosecuting, he said. Likewise if the accused has a track record of sex with minors. \nStill there is a \"universal constant\" in prosecuting these cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage \nchildren for sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will minimize the risk to them, he said. \nVictims usually are from a lower social status, and they may suffer from psychological problems, Dekle \nsaid. \n\"Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been victimized by multiple people over a period of time. Then \nhttp://palmbeachpost.printthis.clickability.corn/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Ignorance+of+age+... 1/2/2008 \nEFTA00013770\n\nIgnorance of age not valid defense in sex cases, expert says Page 3 of 3 \nthe act of abuse produces behavior in the victims that further damages their credibility.\" Examples \ninclude promiscuous behavior and drug abuse. \nSome of the alleged victims in the Epstein case returned to his home multiple times for the massage \nsessions and the $200 to $300 he typically paid them per visit. \"That would be a definite problem for the \nprosecutor,\" said Betty Resch, who prosecuted crimes against children in Palm Beach County for five \nyears and now is in private practice in Lake Worth. \n\"The victim becomes less sympathetic\" to a jury, Resch said. \"But she's a victim nevertheless. She's a \nkid.\" \nMost men charged with sex crimes against minors look normal, Dekle said. A jury expecting to see a \nmonster seldom will. And the victims' ages work against them and in favor of the defendant in a trial, \nDekle said. \nIf a child and an adult tell different stories and both swear they're telling the truth, adult jurors are more \nlikely to believe the adult, Dekle said. \n\"You have all these things working against you in a child sex abuse case. Prosecutors normally try to be \nvery careful in filing those cases because they know what they're getting into. There is no such thing as \nan iron-clad child sexual abuse case.\" \nFind this article at: \nhttp://wmv.palmbeachpost.comilocalnews/contenMocal_newsMpaper/2006/08/04/s1b_epstein_0804.html \n7 \nCheck the box to include the list of links referenced in the article. \nhttp://palmbeachpost.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Ignorance+of+age+... 1/2/2008 \nEFTA00013771",
