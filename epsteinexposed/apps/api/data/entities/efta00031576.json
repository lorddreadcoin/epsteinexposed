And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC \nand MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations? \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Monday, December 21, 2020 4:35 PM \nTo: (USANYS) .cM> (USANYS) \n(USANYS) c\na';  \n(USANYS) \nc> \nca; \n(USANYS) \nCc: \n \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS)>; (USANYS) \nclb; \n(USANYS) 1 <> \nSubject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera \nAll: \nI wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex \ntrafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge \nEngelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and \ncounsel \naccess accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the \ngeneral population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general \npopulation). \nEFTA00031576\n\nJustin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the \nMCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally \nscheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel \nappointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. \nSince this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of \nRivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to \nreview discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health \nconcerns. \nWe have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires \nthe \nMCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, \nwhich requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing \neach week, in addition to \nany telephone or \nvideoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. \nAt the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera \nhas for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although \ndefense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last \nnight and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the \naccommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as \"strikingly different and \nfar superior\" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being \ntreated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the \ndisparity in access \"jumped off the page\" and that the optics were \"terrible,\" and asked us \ntoe \nlain \nthe rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with and \nbefore \nour conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that \nMaxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more \namenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. \nJudge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, \nexplaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. \nBased on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery \naccess are as follows: \nAccommodation \nMaxwell \nRivera \nReview of electronic \ndiscovery (NB: each \ndefendant has laptop access) \n13 hours per day/7 days per \nweek (91 hours total) \n3 hours per day/7 days per \nweek (21 hours total) \nCounsel visits (by \nvideo) \n3 hours per day/5 days per \nweek (15 hours total) \nFour hours per week (plus an \nadditional two hours \nscheduled through the \nFederal Defenders) (6 hours \ntotal) \nWeekend legal calls \nAs \nneeded Not available \nThe declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two \ncriminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that \nyou were all aware of this issue. We are also ha to set up a call to discuss this further. In the \nmeantime, we are working with to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an \nexplanation for the Court. \nBest, \nEFTA00031577\n\nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York NY \n10007 \nTel: \nEFTA00031578",
