The only difference from the last \nbinder I sent you is to change the date and time that the cell site simulator revealed that the phone is located at the \nsubject premises from last night at 10:15pm to this morning at 7:36am. This should be ready to swear out as soon as the \nJudge is available. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00014920",
