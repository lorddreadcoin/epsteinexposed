The charges set forth herein stem from the role \nof GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, in the sexual exploitation \nand abuse of multiple \nminor girls by Jeffrey \nEpstein. In \nparticular, from at least in or about \n1994, up to and including \nat \nleast in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's \nabuse of minor girls by, among \nother things, \nhelping Epstein to recruit, \ngroom, and ultimately \nabuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be \nunder the age \nof \n18. The victims were as young \nas 14 years old when they were \ngroomed and abused by \nMAXWELL and Epstein, both of \nwhom knew \nthat certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. \n2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to \nabuse minor \nvictims, GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein \nenticed and caused minor \nvictims to travel to \nEFTA00018407\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 2 of 18 \nEpstein's residences in different \nstates, which MAXWELL knew and \nintended would result in their \ngrooming for and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, in an \neffort to conceal her crimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, \nincluding in relation to some of the minor victims described \nherein, \nwhen providing testimony under oath in 2016. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. During the time periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, had a personal and \nprofessional \nrelationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his \nclosest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and \nin or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with \nEpstein and also \nwas paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. Over the course of their \nrelationship, MAXWELL and \nEpstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, \nincluding \nin the below image: \nEFTA00018408\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 3 of 18 \n4. Beginning in at \nleast 1994, GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, \nthe defendant, \nenticed and groomed multiple \nminor girls to \nengage \nin sex acts with \nJeffrey Epstein, through a \nvariety of \nmeans and methods, \nincluding but not limited \nto the following: \na. \nMAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of \nEpstein's minor victims \nprior to their abuse, \nincluding by \nasking \nthe victims about their \nlives, their schools, and their \nfamilies. MAXWELL and \nEpstein would spend time \nbuilding \nfriendships with \nminor victims by, for \nexample, taking minor \nvictims to the movies or \nshopping. Some of these outings would \ninvolve MAXWELL and \nEpstein spending time together \nwith a minor \nvictim, while some would \ninvolve MAXWELL or Epstein \nspending \ntime alone with a minor victim. \nb. Having \ndeveloped a rapport with a \nvictim, \nMAXWELL would try to \nnormalize sexual abuse for a minor \nvictim \nby, \namong other things, discussing \nsexual topics, undressing in \nfront of the victim, \nbeing present when a minor \nvictim was \nundressed, \nand/or being present for sex acts \ninvolving the minor \nvictim and Epstein. \nc. MAXWELL'S \npresence during minor \nvictims' \ninteractions \nwith Epstein, including \ninteractions where the \nminor victim was undressed \nor that involved sex \nacts with \nEpstein, helped put the victims \nat ease because an adult \nwoman . \nwas present. For \nexample, in some \ninstances, MAXWELL would \n3 \nEFTA00018409\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 4 of 18 \nmassage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, \nMAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized massages during which a minor victim would \nbe fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in \nEpstein sexually \nabusing the minor victims. \nd. In addition, Epstein offered to help some \nminor victims by paying for travel and/or educational \nopportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain \nvictims to accept \nEpstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel \nindebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to \nhelp them. \ne. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In \nsome instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the \nsexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in \nthe context of \nmassages, which developed into sexual encounters. \n5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a \nsexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to \nengage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's \nresulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, \ntouching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, \nplacing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, \n4 \nEFTA00018410\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 5 of 18 \ndirecting a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and \ndirecting a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. \nMAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS \n6. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or \nabout 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other \nthings, \ninducing and \nenticing, and aiding and abetting the \ninducement and enticement of, multiple minor \nvictims. Victims \nwere groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the \nfollowing: \na. \nA a multi-story private residence on the \nUpper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the \n\"New York Residence\"), which is depicted in the following \nphotograph: \nEFTA00018411\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 6 of 18 \nb. An estate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida owned by \nEpstein (the \"Palm \nBeach Residence\"), which is \ndepicted in the \nfolloKing photograph: \nc. \nA ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by \nEpstein (the \"New \nMexico Residence\"), which is depicted in the \nfollowing photograph: \n6 \nEFTA00018412\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 7 of 18 \nd. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, \nEngland. \n7. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as \nMinor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In \nparticular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, \nMAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with \nrespect to minor victims: \na. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 \nwhen Minor \nVictim-I was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL \nsubsequently \ninteracted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at \nEpstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the \nage of 18 at \nthe time. During these interactions, which took \nplace between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL \ngroomed Minor \nVictim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple \nmeans. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor \nVictim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. \nMAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about \nschool, her classes, her \nfamily, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to \nnormalize inappropriate and abusive \nconduct by, among other \nthings, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being \npresent \nwhen Minor \nVictim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the \nfirst year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein \nbegan sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for \n7 \nEFTA00018413\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 8 of 18 \nand involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL \ninvolved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. \nDuring those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor \nVictim\n-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and \nMAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's \nresidences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor \nVictim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and \nFlorida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state \nlines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with \nMinor Victim-1 after Minor\n-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's \nproperties, including in the context of a \nsexualized massage. \nb. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at \nleast one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in \nNew Mexico when Minor Victim-2 \nwas under the age of 18. Minor \nVictim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of \nstate at \nEpstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or \nsubjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor \nVictim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. \nWhile in New \nMexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and \nMAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed \nMinor Victim-2's school, \nclasses, and family with Minor Victim-\n2. In New \nMexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor \nVictim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing \n8 \nEFTA00018414\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 9 of 18 \nan \nunsolicited massage to \nMinor Victim-2, \nduring which Minor \nVictim-2 was \ntopless. MAXWELL also \nencouraged Minor \nVictim-2 to \nmassage Epstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL groomed \nand befriended \nMinor \nVictim\n-3 in London, England \nbetween approximately \n1994 and 1995, \nincluding during a \nperiod of time in \nwhich MAXWELL knew that \nMinor Victim-3 was under \nthe age of 18. Among \nother things, \nMAXWELL discussed \nMinor Victim-3's life and \nfamily with Minor \nVictim-3. \nMAXWELL introduced Minor \nVictim-3 to Epstein and \narranged for multiple \ninteractions between \nMinor Victim-3 and \nEpstein. During \nthose \ninteractions, MAXWELL \nencouraged Minor \nVictim-3 to massage \nEpstein, knowing that \nEpstein would engage \nin sex acts with \nMinor Victim-3 during \nthose massages. Minor \nVictim-3 provided \nEpstein with the requested \nmassages, and \nduring those \nmassages, Epstein sexually \nabused Minor Victim\n-3. \nMAXWELL was aware that \nEpstein engaged in sexual \nactivity with \nMinor Victim-3 on \nmultiple occasions, \nincluding at times \nwhen \nMinor \nVictim-3 was under the \nage of 18, including \nin the context \nof a \nsexualized massage. \nMAXWELL'S EFFORTS \nTO CONCEAL HER \nCONDUCT \n8.
