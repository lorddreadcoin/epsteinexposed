AM then issued an order denying Maxwell's request for an order \nto show cause, but directing the MDC to affirm whether they copied Maxwell's legal documents and what they are \ndoing to protect her A-C privilege. They submitted a response yesterday that confirmed they did not copy the \ndocuments and outlined their general policies for how attorney visits/calls/video conferences take place. \n•  With respect to her complaints about sleep, Maxwell filed the attached letter yesterday, including a photo of an \nalleged black eye that she doesn't know how she got, but it may be related to how she covers her eyes with a sock \nor cloth at night due to the flashlights. (??) AIN directed us to confer with MDC to answer specific questions \n(attached in the memo endorsement to her letter) and submit a response by May 5, which the team is working on. \nHappy to discuss further if you have questions. \nThanks, \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00022507",
