Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nJuly 17, 2019 \nVIA ECF \nThe Honorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n500 Pearl Street \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear Judge Berman: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to briefly respond to one aspect of the \ndefendant's July 16, 2019 letter (ECF No. 24), and to provide the Court with additional information \nregarding the defendant's foreign passport. The defendant's July 16, 2019 letter asserts: \"[A]s for \nthe Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers \nnothing to suggest—and certainly no evidence—that Epstein ever used it.\" (ECF No. 24 at 7). In \nfact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use \nof the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. \nThe Government further notes that the defendant's submission does not address how the \ndefendant obtained the foreign passport and, more concerning, the defendant has still not disclosed \nto the Court whether he is a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United \nStates. \nCc: All counsel of record (Via ECF) \nRespectfully submitted, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: /s \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nEFTA00016172",
