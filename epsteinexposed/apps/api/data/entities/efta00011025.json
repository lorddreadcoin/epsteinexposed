BERMAN \nu.s.D.J. \nre: \nUnited \nStates \nv. \nEpstein. I :19-cr-00490-RMB \nDear Judge Berman: \nYesterday, I \nwas provided a partial transcript of the \nAugust 27, 2019 hearing in the above-\ncaptioned case, and lam writing to clarify the record. \nAs you know, I co-authored \na New York Law Journal article \nbefore the hearing. The transcript \nquotes \nthe court, in pertinent pan, as \nfollows with reference to me \nand the article: \"On a \nsomewhat more \nserious note, \ndon't quote me on this, but it is my \nunderstanding that one of the \nauthors of that article is \nhimself counsel in one of the \nEpstein-related cases. I was surprised \nto \nlearn \nthat very recently. I'm \ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that \nthat aspect was not disclosed in the Law \nJournal.\" Later in the \nhearing, attorney David Boies made \ncomments consistent with those of the \ncourt. \nJust to \nclear up the evident \nmisunderstanding: I have never been counsel to \nEpstein or his estate \nor to anyone in an Epstein-related \ncase. I did serve as an expert \nwitness, by way of expert declaration, in \nsupport of Professor \nDershowitz's motion to disqualify Mr. \nBoies and his law firm ha v. \nDershowitz, \n1:19-cv-03377 (SDNY), a pending \ndefamation case that might be \ndescribed as \"Epstein-\nrelated.\" My work as \nan expert witness, which \nconcluded in June, did not involve \nmy representation of, \nor advocacy on behalf of, \nProfessor Dershowitz. I did not \nserve as counsel or as an \nadvocate on \nanyone's \nbehalf in co-authoring the law \njournal article. \nVery \ntruly yours, \nBruce A. Green \ncc: AUSA1 \nMartin G. Weinberg, Esq.; Reid \nWeingarten, Esq.; David Boies, Esq. \nEFTA00011025",
