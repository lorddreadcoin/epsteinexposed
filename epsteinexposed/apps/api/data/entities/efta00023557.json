You used the phrase in your testimony \n8 earlier, you used the phrase \"eat out.\" \nCould you \n9 describe what that phrase means in the context that \n10 you were using it? \n11 MR. SCAROLA: We will stipulate that what \n12 it means is cunnilingus. \n13 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n14 \nQ. Okay. \nDo you know what a sex toy is? \n15 MR. \nSCAROLA: Could you explain what \n16 relevance or materiality your understanding of \n17 that line \n--\n18 MR. LUTTIER: Sure. It was --\n19 \nMR. SCAROLA: -- of questioning might have \n20 since there is no allegation that sex toys were \n21 ever employed in encounters between and \n22 Mr. Epstein? \n23 MR. LUTTIER: Well, I  dispute that for \n24 \nsure. I \njust tell you if you read the record \n25 carefully, you will find out that is not at all \n0170 \n1 true, and that's why it is relevant. Come up \n2 many a time. \n3 MR. SCAROLA: In connection with \n4 allegations from ? \n5 MR. LUTTIER: There and in the IME. \n6 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, if you \n7 represent, if you represent that that's the \n8 case, then proceed. \n9 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n10 \nQ. Do \nyou know what a sex toy is? \n11 A. Yes. \n12 Q. Okay. And what is your understanding of \n13 that term so that we are understanding each other \n14 when I  ask you these questions? \n15 A. I  guess toys used doing sexual things. \n16 Q. Okay.

No. \n23 \nQ. \nNever? \n24 A. \nNever. \n25 Q. Either -- how about with ? \n0171 \n1 A. No. \n2 Q. Did you ever tell anybody you had? \n3 A. No. \n4 Q. Did you, did you ever use any sex toy with \n5 Jeffrey Epstein? \n6 A. He tried to use a massage thing and I  told him \n7 no. \nfile:///CIADocuments%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop-c:420Vol.°4208.ixt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023559\n\n8 Q. What did you mean by \"massage thing\"? \n9 A. Whatever it was in the hell that he had. \n10 Q. Well, what -- describe what you are \n11 talking about. \n12 A. I  just told you. \n13 Q. Well, massage thing doesn't tell me \n14 anything. What are you talking about? \n15 A. I  don't know what it was called. I  don't know \n16 what it is. \n17 Q. What did it look like? \n18 A. It looked -- it was -- I  don't know. It \n19 vibrated. It looked like it was a neck massager. \n20 Q. But do you know, do you know -- can you \n21 describe, physically describe how big it was, what \n22 color it was, what it looked like? Can you describe \n23 anything about it? \n24 A. It was gray and do you want me to draw you a \n25 picture because I  don't know how to describe what it \n0172 \n1 looked like. \n2 Q. How large was it? \n3 A. It was like this big (indicating). \n4 Q. Okay. \n5 A. It was like a neck massager. \n6 Q. You know like -- you know what Brookstone \n7 is, a store? \n8 A. Yeah. \n9 Q. Have you ever been in there and they have \n10 these massages that, like you can reach behind your \n11 back and stuff like that. Are we talking about \n12 something you know, like that? \n13 A. Yeah, but it didn't have a wire, an electrical \n14 wire. \n15 Q. Okay. \n16 A. It was like battery operated. \n17 Q. And you say that Mr. Epstein tried to use \n18 this on you and you said no? \n19 A. Yeah. \n20 Q. And then \nhe --\n21 A. That was the end of that. \n22 Q. -- didn't use it? \n23 A. He did not, and he's never, it never was \n24 brought up again. \n25 Q. Have you ever desired to use any kind of \n0173 \n1 sex toy? \n2 A. No. \n3 Q. And, and then not done it for some reason? \n4 A. No. \n5 Q. Okay. Back to .  How many \n6 sexual encounters would you estimate you had with \n7 \n8 A. I  don't know. \n9 Q. What's your best estimate with what degree \nfile:///CVDocuments%20and%20SettingsfProductionMesktor cY020Vol.cY0208.ixt[ 1 2/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023560\n\n10 of frequency did you and she have a sexual \n11 relationship? \n12 MR. SCAROLA: Those are two different \n13 questions, compound. \n14 THE WITNESS: What does this --\n15 MR. LUTTIER: With what --\n16 THE WITNESS: What does this have to do \n17 with me and Mr. Epstein? \n18 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n19 grWith what degree of frequency did you and \n20 have sexual relations? \n21 MR. SCAROLA: That's the second part of \n22 the question that you asked. \n23 \nMR. LUTTIER: That's the question. I  will \n24 break it up then. \n25 \n0174 \n1 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n2 . You've testified earlier that you and ■ \n3 had sexual relations? \n4 MR. SCAROLA: We'll stipulate that that \n5 occurred on multiple occasions. \n6 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n7 Q. All right. Tell me with what degree --\n8 MR. SCAROLA: And beyond that an inquiry \n9 is intended for no other purpose except to \n10 annoy, harass, and embarrass. \nI  1 MR. LUTTIER: With all due respect, I \n12 disagree. So, I  am going to ask my question. \n13 MR. SCAROLA: And I  disagree with your \n14 disagreement. And I  will instruct her not to \n15 answer. \n16 MR. LUTTIER: Okay. Let me get the \n17 question out. \n18 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n19 Q. On how many occasions did you and \n20 have sexual relations? \n21 MR. SCAROLA: And the stipulation is that \n22 it occurred on multiple occasions and beyond \n23 \nthat no relevant inquiry can be made. \n24 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n25 \nQ. And when, when your lawyer stipulates that \n0175 \n1 it's multiple occasions, if you had a relationship \n2 with her for 12 months, can you estimate how many \n3 times it  was? \n4 A. I \nrefuse --\n5 MR. SCAROLA: Don't answer that question. \n6 \nTHE WITNESS: -- to answer. \n7 MR. LUTTIER: And you refuse to answer --\n8 MR. SCAROLA: Because her lawyer has \n9 instructed her not to answer because the \n10 question is obviously intended, after the \n11 stipulation, for no other purpose except to \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop \"120Vol.%208.ixt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023561\n\n12 annoy, embarrass, and harass the witness. \n13 MR. LUTTIER: It's, it's not intended to \n14 be annoying. I  believe the degree of \nfrequency \n15 is absolutely relevant in the case. \n16 MR. SCAROLA: To what -- to which element? \n17 MR. LUTTIER: Arguable -- well --\n18 MR. SCAROLA: To which element? \n19 MR. LUTTIER: I  don't want to --\n20 MR. SCAROLA: To which element of the \n21 offense? \n22 MR. LUTTIER: I  am not going to argue my \n23 case to you, but it absolutely has an effect on \n24 the alleged claim of damages. Beyond that I \n25 \ndon't need to tell you the theory of my case \n0176 \n1 but --\n2 MR. SCAROLA: I  disagree. \n3 MR. LUTTIER: Okay. \n4 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n5 Q.

What does that mean? \n13 Q. Well, did you she and she both agree \nyou \n14 were going to go your separate ways --\n15 A. Yeah. \n16 Q. -- or did you just cut it off? \n17 A.

No, because I  don't want them to. \n9 \nQ. Okay. So, help me understand how has this \n10 impacted you at all that you claim you can't trust \n11 men that are older than you? \n12 A. Because I  can't trust them. What else do you \n13 want me to say? \n14 Q. Well, I  want you to describe how --\n15 A. I  can't --\nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop: €420Vol.%208.ixt[ 1 2/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023589\n\n16 Q. How your damage -- what is it that you \n17 want these men to do --\n18 A. Nothing, I  don't want them to do anything. \n19 Q. -- that -- wait a minute. \n20 A. I  want them all to leave me alone. \n21 Q. What is it that you want these men to do \n22 that you can't trust them to do? \n23 \nA. There is nothing that I  don't want, that I \n24 want them to do. \n25 \nQ. Have you ever asked a man older than you \n0234 \n1 to do something? \n2 A. Other than my attorneys, no. \n3 Q. All right. \n4 A. No \noffense to you guys. \n5 Q. So, there has never been an occasion since \n6 you last went to Mr. Epstein where you asked a man \n7 that was older than you to do something and you \n8 counted on trusting them? \n9 A. I counted -- well, my attorneys, but that's \n10 it. \n11 Q. Okay. But there has never been a time \n12 that you've placed your trust --\n13 A. I  refuse --\n14 Q. Wait a minute. \n15 A. No, I  don't let them, allow them. \n16 Q. Now, so, you haven't even attempted to, \n17 \nquote, to use your words, trust a man that's older \n18 than you since you last saw Mr. Epstein; is that \n19 correct? \n20 A. Yes. That's correct. \n21 Q. Now, when you say trust, do you mean you \n22 don't want to be in their physical presence? \n23 \nA. I  don't, no, I  don't want to be in their \n24 physical \npresence. \n25 \nQ. But in fact as you testified \nearlier, you \n0235 \n1 worked for at least two escort services \nwhere you \n2 have gone out and been paid to be in the \npresence of \n3 men older than you, correct? \n4 A. Correct. \n5 Q. Didn't feel like you were in any kind of \n6 danger, right? \n7 A. No, sometimes I  did. And I  already told you \n8 those times. \n9 Q. Well, you wouldn't have gone if \nyou \n10 thought you were in any danger, would you? \n11 A. Exactly. \n12 \nQ. Okay. So there \nwere many occasions that \n13 the driver came and got \nyou, and you were going out \n14 with somebody at the escort services \nwhere they were \n15 older than you and you had no fear of anything; \n16 isn't that right? \n17 A. Yes. \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop: \"120Vol.%208.ixt[ 1 2/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023590\n\n18 Q. By the way, when you worked for these \n19 escort services, would they call you up and tell you \n20 on such-and-such a day there is somebody that wants \n21 to go out with you? Is that how it was done? \n22 A. Yes. \n23 \nQ. What would they tell you about the person \n24 that wanted to go out with you, if anything? \n25 \nA. They would tell me where, what the occasion \n0236 \n1 was, what I  would be doing, what kind of wear I  would \n2 have to wear, formal, outside, the type of dress I \n3 needed to wear. \n4 Q. Did they -- well, what specifically did \n5 they tell you about what you had to wear? Did they \n6 tell you, describe what kind of clothes or just--\n7 A. I  just said formal. \n8 Q. But did they say, for example, wear \n9 something that's low cut or don't wear a bra or, you \n10 know, wear this or wear that? \n11 A. No. \n12 Q. Or this is just a  formal or this is a \n13 semi-formal occasion? \n14 A. It's a  formal or semi-formal for the fourth \n15 time now I  am telling you. So I  am done answering \n16 questions about that. \n17 Q. What else did they tell you other than \n18 what to wear? \n19 A. Nothing. \n20 Q. Did they tell you anything at all about \n21 the person with whom you would be going out? \n22 \nA. \nSometimes. \n23 \nQ. And with what degree of frequency \nwould \n24 they tell you about the person that you were \ngoing \n25 out with? Did they always do that? \n0237 \n1 A. Sometimes. I  just said sometimes. \n2 Q. More than half the time? \n3 A. Sometimes. If it was --\n4 Q. More than half--\n5 \nA. -- more than half the time, I  would have said \n6 more than half the time, but it's sometimes. \n7 \nQ. So \nthat was --\n8 A. Sometimes yes and sometimes no, sometimes. \n9 Q. Would you estimate that it was less than \n10 half the time? \n11 A. I'm not answering that question seriously \n12 because I  have said sometimes. \n13 Q. Describe sometimes to me by percentage. \n14 A. I  don't know the percentage of sometimes. \n15 Sometimes. \n16 Q. Well, let's -- we all know what 50 percent \n17 is, right? \n18 \nA. So 50 percent. There you go. There is your \n19 sometimes. \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop, Ve20Vol.%2011.ixt[ 1 2/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023591\n\n20 Q. Don't let me put words in your mouth, \n21 ma'am. You were there, not me. \n22 A. I  said sometimes. \n23 Q. If you could just tell me if it was more \n24 or less than 50 percent of the time? \n25 MR. SCAROLA: And you have been told \n0238 \n1 repeatedly that she is unable to do that for \n2 \nyou. \n3 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n4 Q. So, how can you quantify for me by \n5 \ndefinition your phrase sometimes? \n6 MR. SCAROLA: And the answer to that \n7 question is she's been unable to. So we're \n8 sorry that we can't give you more specific \n9 information. But \"sometimes\" obviously means \n10 more than once and less than always. \n11 THE WITNESS: So you figure it out. \n12 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n13 Q. Well, now, ma'am, it would be hard for me \n14 to do that. I  wasn't there. So, it could have been \n15 as much, according to your definition, as 99 percent \n16 of the time, right? \n17 MR. SCAROLA: At this point those \n18 questions are annoying, embarrassing, and \n19 harassing, and I  will instruct the witness not \n20 to answer. \n21 BY MR. LUTTIER: \n22 Q. What else, if anything, were you \ntold \n23 about the individuals that you were going to be \n24 going out with when you were working for the escort \n25 services? \n0239 \n1 A. What does this have to do with the original \n2 question at hand? \n3 Q. If you can just answer my question now. \n4 A. And I  already told you what they would tell \n5 me. \n6 Q. Were you told anything else? \n7 A. No. \n8 \nQ. Were \nyou told the person's name? \n9 A. Yes. \n10 Q. All right. Were you told \nthe person's \n11 name each time? \n12 A. Yes. \n13 Q. All right.

Did you tell the people at the escort \n20 service that you only wanted to go out with people \n21 of a certain age bracket? \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop, Ve20Vol.%2011.ixt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023592\n\n22 A. No. \n23 Q. You had to -- it was like a come and take \n24 all? You had to go out with whoever they said? \n25 A. Yes. \n0240 \n1 Q. Did you have the right to say no to \n2 \nsomebody? \n3 A. Yes. \n4 Q. Did you ever, did they ever call you and \n5 say they had someone for you to go out with and you \n6 said, no, I  don't want to go out with them? \n7 A. No. \n8 \nQ.

What's your best estimate about how many \n12 escorts you had between these two escort services? \n13 A. I  don't know. \n14 Q. More than 50? \n15 A. No. \n16 Q. More than 25? \n17 A. No. About 25 people. \n18 \nQ. Were \nyou told the person's race? \n19 A. Yes. \n20 Q. Did you give the escort service any \n21 criteria about the type of person you would agree \nto \n22 go out with? \n23 A. Yes. \n24 Q. What criteria did you give them? \n25 A. I  wouldn't go out with black guys because \n0241 \n1 black people are abusive and controlling. And I  have, I \n2 just felt unsafe. And I  would only go out with people \n3 that didn't want sex or anything sexual. \n4 \nQ. So you said \nno black guys and you said no \n5 one that wants anything, sex or anything that's \n6 sexual? \n7 A. Yes. \n8 Q. Did you have to describe for the escort \n9 service --\n10 A. No, I  didn't. \n11 Q. -- what you meant by sexual? \n12 A. Anybody in their right mind what know what \nI 3 sexual and sexual things are. \n14 \nQ. \nSo, you didn't give them any age bracket, \n15 right? \n16 A. No. \n17 Q.

Why does anybody take up using drugs \n13 \nor --\n14 Q. What boyfriend are you referring to, \n15 saying Mt your boyfriend? \n16 A. \n17 Q. Now, why do you say you lost because \n18 of Mr. Epstein? \n19 A. Because he found out finally we got into an \n20 argument and I  just told him everything that had \n21 happened and --\n22 Q.

I  mean you, you had done, you had engaged \n4 in sex with others, you engaged in sex with both \n5 sexes. You had done all sorts of things that \n6 Mr. Epstein never did with you, hadn't you? \n7 A. So, what does that have to do with \n8 Mr. Epstein, my sex life. \n9 Q. When you talk about being disgusted --\n10 A. Why don't you get naked in front of an old man \n11 and play with his nipples while he masturbates. You do \n12 that and then you tell me if you feel good. \n13 Q. And as you mentioned earlier, you did that \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20SettingsfProduction/Desktop \"120Vol.%208.ixt[ 1 2/11/2009 6:15:58 PM] \nEFTA00023614\n\n14 to get \nmoney? \n15 A. So?
