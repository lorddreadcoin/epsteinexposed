A forensic psychological service is a psychological evaluation, consultation, or \nexpert \nwitness \nservice that is undertaken \nfor legal \npurposes. Dr. Hughes \nprovides forensic \npsychological services to a \nlaw firm who \nis the \nclient. The litigant is \nnot Dr. Hughes' \nclient. \nA \nforensic \npsychological evaluation typically involves face-to-face \ninterview with the \nperson \nto be \nevaluated, psychological testing, collaborative \ninterviews with \nindividuals deemed \nnecessary by Dr. Hughes to conduct a  thorough and complete evaluation, and review of \ndocuments and other \nevidence. \nEvaluation \nsessions, including testing, are \narranged by \nappointment. Dr. \nHughes may form and provide findings, \nimpressions, \nopinions, \nconclusions, and recommendations regarding the legal issue(s) \nat hand. \nThese services are \nnot \nintended for the purpose of \ntherapy. Dr. Hughes' \nfindings, \nimpressions, opinions, \nconclusions, and recommendations are based on \nthe evaluation \nprocedure and are \nindependent. \nConfidentiality.  The usual laws governing confidentiality between \npsychotherapist and \npatient do not apply to the relationship or information obtained during the course of the \nforensic evaluation. Information obtained in the course of the forensic \nevaluation will be \nshared \nwith the individual's attorney. This policy also recognizes Dr. Hughes' use of \nprofessional test scoring services, and \nother \nprofessional \nconsultation \nas deemed advisable \nby Dr. Hughes. Be \naware that in certain \ninstances the law \nrequires Dr. \nHughes to disclose \nprivileged information, for example, in situations of suspected child abuse, of potential harm \nto \noneself \nor \nanother, and \nin \ninstances \nwhere the \ncourt orders the \ndisclosure of \nprivileged \ninformation \nand records. \nResults. \nWritten reports may be requested \nby an attorney or the court. Any \nresults, \nreports, \nand copies of records shall only be \nprepared, written, and provided after the full evaluation is \ncompleted. Partial reports will \nnot be provided. \nFees. Dr. Hughes' usual and customary fee is $500 per hour or portion thereof for all \nforensic services including but not limited to evaluation appointments, psychological testing \nand \ntest scoring, \ncollateral \ninterviews, attorney \nconsultation, review of \ndocuments/records, \npreparation of written reports/affidavits/declarations, deposition and testimony preparation, \nand travel \ntime (door to \ndoor). \nCourt and \ndeposition testimony are billed in full or half-day increments at the hourly rate of \n$500 \n—  that is, $2000 per half-day (9:00 to \n1:00) and $4000 per full-day (9:00 to 5:00). \nPayment \nis required at \nleast 72 hours in \nadvance. In the \nevent that \na deposition/testimony is \nEFTA00024767\n\ncancelled, or the case \nsettled less than 72 hours in advance, Dr. Hughes \nwill be \npaid for \ntime \nallotted for said testimony as Dr. Hughes' schedule is made far in advance. In addition, if \nopposing \ncounsel calls for \nmy deposition and refuses to pay according to my stated fee \nstructure, the retaining attorney is responsible. Fees for photocopying \nand other staff-related \nactivities \nare billed at $50 \nper hour. \nDisbursements, which will also be \nbilled, include actual \ncosts associated with psychological \ntesting, for example, test scoring, as well as travel \nexpenses and \nother \nreasonable expenses incurred. \nThe financially responsible party shall be the law firm by whom Dr. Hughes is retained. The \nresponsible party shall pay the \nfees and \ndisbursements for all time \nand services provided by \nDr. Hughes. Dr. Hughes will not accept payment from the litigant directly. If the litigant \nfails to attend the scheduled evaluation, fails to provide more than 72 hours notice of \ncancellation, or fails to cooperate with the evaluation, the financially responsible party shall \nbe responsible for full payment for full time allotted for the evaluation. \nRetainer or Court Order.  A retainer of $7000 is due at least 48 \nhours before the first \nconsultation or evaluation session with Dr. Hughes and before Dr. Hughes may be identified \nto \nopposing \ncounsel or to the Court as having \nbeen \nretained by the law firm. \nThe first $3500 \nis \nnon-refundable. \nThe remaining retainer shall be \napplied to the \nfinal billing statement, \nand \nDr. Hughes shall return any unused remaining portion of the retainer to the payer. In lieu of \na retainer, a court order or other document guaranteeing payment will be required. \nThe \nactual final \ncost of forensic \nservices \nvaries widely depending \non the amount of \ntime \nspent by Dr. Hughes, the amount of contact with the parties and the attorneys, the amount \nof \ninformation to be read, \nand the degree of \ncomplexity of the matter. Dr. \nHughes' \nfees may \nsubstantially exceed the initial retainer and additional retainers shall be required. Additional \nretainers \nand fees \nshall be paid \npromptly \nwhen \nrequested \nby Dr. \nHughes. \nAgreement.  All agreements and contracts with Dr. Hughes are in writing.
