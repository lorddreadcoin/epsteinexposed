(I took \noff \nthis, so he \ndoesn't respond with the substance and create needless 3500.) The most significant takeaway I recall from \nsummary was that \"_\" said he gave Epstein the sheets he used. But again, this is second-hand, and has his own \nissues we can discuss separately. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 24, 2019, at 2:38 PM, (USANYS) <> wrote: \nThanks.

For \nseveral months, has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and \nthird-hand information that's not actionable unless another inmate also cooperates. We can also talk in person next \nweek about the relative quality of his information. \nI leave it to you guys to follow up with as you see fit. I'm sure someone on this email can make available \nto you, if you want, once you get a sense of what he's about. I just don't want to unilaterally sit on this. \nHave a nice weekend! \nU \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019700",
