As we continue our review of materials from the prior Florida investigation into Epstein, we've \nrealized that the SDFL team assigned what appears to be a unique Jane Doe number (e.g., Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2) to \neach of the victims SDFL identified. We have not been able to find a key matching up each Jane Doe number with the \ncorresponding victim name. Any chance you would be able to help us track that down, please? In order to figure out \nwhether a document refers to one of our witnesses, we need to know the names that go with each Jane Doe number. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00024473",
