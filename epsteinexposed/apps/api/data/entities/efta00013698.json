Lefkowitz, P.C. \nTo Call Writer Directly: \n(212)446-4970 \nlefkowitz@kirkland.com \nVIA E-MAIL \nDa \n=group Center \n159 East 53rd \nStreet \nNew York, \nNew York \n10022-4611 \n(212) 446.4800 \nwvny.kirkland.com \nNovember 8, 2007 \nRe: \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nFacsimile: \n(212) 4464900 \nI write in \nresponse to your recent letter, \ndated November 5, 2007. I want \nto make clear at \nthe outset \nthat Mr. Epstein is complying fully \nwith the Non Prosecution \nAgreement (the \n\"Agreement\") and that he has every \nintention of continuing to honor its \nterms in good faith. Any \ndisagreement the parties \nhave regarding the terms \nof the Agreement should be \nresolved through \nopen dialogue and \nshould not be construed as a \nrepudiation of the Agreement. I do, \nhowever, \nwant to address each of the points you raise in \nyour letter. \nFirst, we \ndo not believe Mr. \nEpstein's agents are precluded \nfrom speaking to any \nindividuals at this point in \ntime. We carefully reviewed \nthe Agreement and the \nlaws governing \ncontact with \nwitnesses and \nproceeded under the belief that \nMr. Epstein's agents \ncould properly \ncontact potential witnesses in this \nmatter. We believe that \nnothing in the Agreement \nprecludes \ncontact by \nMr. Epstein's agents with \nany individuals. \nParagraph 7 of the Agreement \nstates that \n\"Epstein's \ncounsel may contact the \nidentified individuals through [the \nattorney representative],\" \nbut it in no way \nrestricts any other \ncontacts that are both \nlawful and appropriate. \nFurthermore, \nyour Office \nhas not yet identified the \nalleged victims under \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 nor \nhas an attorney \nrepresentative been \nselected. \nIndeed, it  is quite \ncommon for a  party's \nagents, and even his \nattorneys, to speak with \npotential \nclaimants prior to their \nretaining formal \nrepresentation. And in this \nsituation — where \nMr. \nEpstein faces \nsignificant potential civil \nexposure, and he \nhas a right to test the \nveracity of \nthese \nclaims — it is \nappropriate that his \nagents would seek to \nobtain as much \ninformation about \npotential \nclaims as possible. \nNevertheless, because \nwe want to \ncooperate with your Office \nand \nsince you \nobject to such \ncommunications, we will cease all \ncontact with these \nindividuals until \nthe date \nof Mr. Epstein's \nplea. We \nrequest, however, that \nyour Office \nprovide a  basis for \nprecluding Mr. Epstein or \nhis agents from \nspeaking to any \nindividuals at this time. \nChicago Hong \nKong \nLondon Los Angeles \nMunich San Francisco Washington. \nD.C. \nEFTA00013698\n\nKIRKLAND & \nELLIS LLP \nJeffrey Sloman \nNovember 8, 2007 \nPage 2 \nSecond, I  am a  little \nsurprised by your insistence that we request that the state court \nconduct the plea and sentence in November. You may recall that \nwe previously discussed, and \nyou agreed, that because the state judge will not \nstagger the plea and sentencing as we \ncontemplated in the Agreement, Mr. Epstein could \nplea and be sentenced at any point before \nJanuary 4, 2008. As you know, the judge's refusal to stagger the plea and sentencing actually \nharms Mr. Epstein because this delays the timing under which he can receive the names of the \nindividuals identified by the United States as \"victims\" under § 2255. But \nwe believe we must \ndefer to the judge's decision in this matter. To clear up any \nmisunderstanding, however, the \njudge has set this case \"for trial\" on January 7 only as a formal matter. The judge has invited the \nparties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 4, and we do not anticipate any delay \nbeyond that date. \nThird, I  want to clear up any confusion regarding the many inaccurate media reports \nabout Mr. Epstein. With the hope of maintaining some semblance of privacy for Mr. Epstein, we \nhave avoided interacting with the media regarding this matter. Indeed, the only recent comment \nwas Howard Rubenstein's confirmation to the Palm Beach Daily News that this matter had been \nresolved and would not proceed to a trial. That comment was authorized only out of concern that \nyou might read an inaccurate story and believe, mistakenly, that Mr. Epstein had decided not to \nproceed under the \nAgreement. \nFourth, regarding the sentence to be imposed by the court, the Agreement, and all of the \ndiscussions we have had about it, are very clear: Mr. Epstein is to be sentenced to an 18-month \nterm in accordance with the same rules and regulations (and the same rights and privileges) that \napply to everyone in the state of Florida. That Mr. Epstein would be treated no better and no \nworse than anyone else was a material term of the Agreement. If your Office now believes he is \nnot entitled to equal treatment, I  would very \nmuch appreciate an explanation of the basis of such \nview. I  am sufficiently concerned \nabout comments in your letter to seek clarification on this \npoint, especially because the lawyers in your \nOffice have made clear on numerous occasions to \nme that as long as Mr. Epstein received an I8-month \nsentence, your Office would not seek to \ninterfere \nwith the \nimplementation \nof \nthe state \nsentence. \nFifth, pursuant to \nthe Agreement, Mr. Epstein, through his counsel, agrees to \nprovide the \nagreements made with the State \nAttorney's Office. \nFinally, I  must tell you that I am troubled by the \nmanner in which your Office has dealt \nwith the § 2255 issues that are \nencompassed in the Agreement. As you \nalready know, one of the \nlawyers initially recommended by your \nOffice contacted Judge Davis to \nlobby for the assignment \nof \nattorney representative even before \nJudge Davis was formally selected to \nappoint an attorney \nrepresentative. \nMoreover, I find it highly unusual \nthat your Office has continued to \ninsist that a \nEFTA00013699\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS \nLLP \nNovember 8, 2007 \nPage 3 \nprimary criteria for the \nappointment of the attorney \nrepresentative should be the ability to \ntake on \ncontingency fee cases directed \nat Mr. Epstein. I  trust you \nunderstand that I  raise these \nconcerns \nwith you out of \nrespect for your Office. \nHowever, despite Mr. Epstein's \nfull intention to abide \nby all of the terms of the \nAgreement, we must reserve our \nright to object to certain \naspects of the \n§ 2255 provisions of the Agreement. \nI  look forward to \ncontinuing to work with \nyour Office to resolve any \noutstanding issues, \nand I sincerely anticipate a \nconclusion of this matter in the \nvery near future. \nSincerely, \nEFTA00013700",
