The Maxwell team is now turning to review the SDFL documents that you helped get \nloaded onto Relativity. Would you please help us get those documents batched out for review? Specifically, please break \ndown all of the documents in the folder entitled \"USAO-SDFL Files\" within the \"US v Epstein\" database into batches of \napproximately 500 documents. \nWould you please also add an Issue Designation tag entitled \"Relevant to NPA\" to the preexisting Issue Designation tags? \nThanks ve much, \nEFTA00029268",
