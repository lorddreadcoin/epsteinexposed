We have been \nwriting about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get \nBill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has been \nthe former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rod-Larsen, who resigned as president of the International \nPeace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching our translated \narticles. \nThe reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've heard \nthat You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be grateful \nif we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We have reason to \nbelieve that both Mr. Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during Christmas to \nEpstein's island in the years 2010-2015. \nI'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website. \nEFTA00020923\n\nHere are some of our 40 articles: \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/intemational-peace-institute/terje-rod-larsen/jeffrey-epstein/norwegian-newspaper-\ndn-reveals-diplomat-terje-rod-larsen-owed-'effrey-epstein-130000/2-1-891702 \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/terje-rod-larsen/bill-gates/jeffreyspstein/behind-the-scenes-how-jeffreyspstein-\nhelped-billionaire-bill-gates-fund-un-affiliated-think-tank-projects/2-1-885697 \nhttps://www.dn.no/magasinet/dokumentar/jeffrey-epstein/thorbjom-jaglanciftede-rod-larsen/bill-gates-and-\njeffrey-epstein-met-with-nobel-committee-chair/2-1-885834 \nhttps://www.dn.no/politikk/jeffrey-epstein/terje-rod-larsen/mona-juul/jeffrey-epstein-funded-special-\nperformance-of-tony-award-winning-play-for-the-un-community/2-1-918850 \nBest regards, \nTore Gjerstad \nPolitical reporter \nDagensNwringSliv \nThe Norwegian Business Daily \nMobil: \nwww.dn.no \nTwitter: \n®toregjerstad \nEFTA00020924",
