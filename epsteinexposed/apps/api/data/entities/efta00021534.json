Out of an abundance of caution, can you \nfile the documents with any reference to evidence/discovery and cooperators redacted? We can then review the \nunredacted version and discuss what, if anything, can be unredacted for the public version. \nU. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, August 2, 201911:03 AM \nTo: \n) \nCc \n(USANYS) \nSubject: motions under seal? \nOur motions will be ready to go out in a few hours., One is straight forward legal argument about the cell tower data, \nwhich we don't have a problem filing. The other motion deals with the statements to the police and by necessity we \ndiscuss the statements in detail. We also discuss some of the discovery and the cooperating witnesses. What is the \nGovernment position about filing that motion under seal? \nAlso, affidavit hasn't been signed because the only regular access to a notary are members of his legal team and we \ndon't want to witness his signature. We will have him sign it through whatever the process is at MCC or in open court at \nour next appearance. \nGarden City, NY 11530 \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.
