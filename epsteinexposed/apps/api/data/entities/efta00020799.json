I don't believe they were underage victims of Epstein, \nbut they apparently have useful information and also may have been victims of coercive sexual encounters with \nEpstein and/or his associates. Any days or times this week you would •not• be available for that? \nSeparately, there have now been two stories in the Times where a publicist, Mr. R. Couri Hay, has been referenced \nas having recently been told by Epstein about Epstein's prior conduct. Can we please try to contact him? Can issue \nhim a subpoena, attached, if he doesn't want to be interviewed informally. \n(Here's the latest reference to him: \"Just three months ago, as federal prosecutors were closing in with new \ncharges, Mr. Epstein had a conversation with R. Couri Hay, a publicist, about continuing to improve his \nreputation. Mr. Epstein asserted that what he was convicted of did not constitute pedophilia, said Mr. Hay, \nwho declined to represent him. The girls he had sex with were \"tweens and teens,\" Mr. Epstein told him.\") \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00020800",
