We \nshould preview that both memos have expanded considerably based on the comments and suggestions, so it may \nbe helpful to do an additional turn once you're able to review so we're sending up the best (and not unnecessarily \nrushed) products -- it would give everybody some breathing room, I think, if we aimed for very polished final \nversions early next week. But if you both have very few comments on the next rounds, they likely could get \npushed up as early as tomorrow. \nEFTA00031573\n\n> \nFrom \n> Sent: \nThursda Aril 09 2020 \n08:51 \n> \nTo \n> \nCc \n> \nSubject: Memos \n> \nHey guys, \n> Do you \nthink you will get either \nof the memos to us \ntoday?
