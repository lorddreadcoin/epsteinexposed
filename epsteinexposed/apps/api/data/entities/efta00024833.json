Kuntz, II, Judge) denying Boustani's bail \napplication and directing that he be detained pending trial. We \naffirmed \nthe District Court's order by \norder on May 16, \n2019. We write \nto explain that decision and to \nclarify the circumstances under which \nthe Bail Reform Act permits a  District Court to \nrelease a  defendant \npending trial pursuant to a  condition under which the defendant \nwould pay for private \narmed security guards. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nBoustani is \ncharged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in \nviolation \nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1349; \nconspiracy to commit \nsecurities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and \n78ff \nand 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 371; and conspiracy to \ncommit money laundering, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § \n1956(a) and (h). \nBoustani filed an application for bail pending trial, proposing a \nset of conditions that included home confinement under the \nsupervision of private armed \nsecurity guards, to be paid for by \nBoustani. The Government \nopposed \nBoustani's request and argued \nthat he \nshould be detained pending trial because he was a flight risk. \n3 \nEFTA00024835\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page4 of 10 \nThe \nDistrict Court denied Boustani's bail application, and Boustani \nappealed. We affirmed the District \nCourt's order without prejudice to \nfurther bail applications before the District Court.' Boustani then filed \nanother bail application, which the District Court again denied on \nMarch 28, 2019. Boustani now appeals from the District Court's order \ndenying his second bail \napplication. After oral argument on May 14, \n2019, we affirmed the \nDistrict Court order by order \non May 16, \n2019. \nII. \nDISCUSSION \nWe review a district court's order of detention for clear error \nand will reverse only where \"on the entire evidence we are left with \nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"2\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, a court is required to order the \npretrial release of a defendant on personal recognizance or after \nexecution of an appearance \nbond \"unless the \njudicial officer \ndetermines that such release will not reasonably assure the \nappearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of \nany other \nperson or the community.\"3 If the court finds that a \ndefendant poses a risk of flight, it must release him \"subject to the \nleast restrictive further \ncondition, or combination of conditions, \n'  See United States v. Boustani, \nNo. 19-344, 2019 WL 2070656, at •1 (2d Cir. \nMar. 7, \n2019). \n2  United States v. &Ottani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n3 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3142(b). \n4 \nEFTA00024836\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page5 of 10 \nthat .. . will reasonably assure the appearance \nof the person.\"4 The \ncourt must \norder detention, however, if it \"finds that no condition or \ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of \nthe person as required and the safety of any other person and the \ncommunity.\"5 In \ndetermining \nwhether \nany condition \nor combination \nof \nconditions is sufficient, a \ncourt should \nconsider several \nfactors, \nincluding: (1) the nature and \ncircumstances of the charged offense; \n(2) the weight of the evidence; (3) the history and characteristics of \nthe defendant; and (4) the nature \nand seriousness of the danger \nposed by the \ndefendant's release.' \nThe Government bears the burden of proving by a \npreponderance of the evidence both that the defendant \"presents an \nactual risk of flight\" and that \"no condition or combination of \nconditions could \nbe \nimposed on the \ndefendant that \nwould \nreasonably \nassure his presence in court.\"7\nWe have previously recognized that, in limited circumstances, \na court may release a \ndefendant subject to conditions of home \nconfinement in which, among other things, the defendant pays for \nprivate armed security guards.' In United States v. Sabhnani, we first \n18 U.S.C. § \n3142(c)(1)(B). \n5 18 U.S.C. § \n3142(e). \n6 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g); \nSabhnani, 493 F.3d at 76 & n.16. \n' \nSabhnani, 493 \nF.3d at 75. \n8  td. at \n77-78. \n5 \nEFTA00024837\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page6 of 10 \nacknowledged that such home confinement, combined with other \nrestrictive \nconditions, may \nsuffice to reasonably assure the \ndefendant's appearance in court. We noted in \nthat case, however, \nthat \nwe had \"no occasion to \nconsider whether it \nwould be contrary \nto \nprinciples of \ndetention and release on bail to allow wealthy \ndefendants to buy their \nway out by constructing a private jail.\"9 We \nobserved that the defendants in that case were likely denied bail \nbecause of their wealth and that defendants of \"lesser means . . . \nmight have been granted bail in the first place.\"'° \nSince Sabhnani, however, we have highlighted our concerns \nregarding granting bail to defendants because of their wealth. In non-\nprecedential summary \norders, \nwe \nhave \nobserved that \npretrial release \npursuant to, inter alia, \nconditions such as \nsupervision by privately \nhired security \nguards may not be appropriate for wealthy \ndefendants \nwhen similarly situated defendants of \nlesser means would be \ndetained.\" And we have noted that district courts need not routinely \nconsider \"the \nretention of self-paid private security guards,\" which \n9  td. at 78 n.18 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n10 a \n\"  See, e.g., United States v. \nEsposito, 749 F. App'x 20, 24 (2c1 Cir. 2018) (non-\nprecedential summary order). \n6 \nEFTA00024838\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, \nPagel \nof 10 \nmay \nbe best understood as \"a less onerous form of \ndetention \navailable only \nto the \nwealthy.\"12\nWe now expressly hold that the Bail Reform Act does not \npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means \nare detained pending trial while wealthy defendants are released to \nself-funded private jails. It is a fundamental principle of fairness that \nthe law protects \"the interests of rich and poor criminals in equal \nscale, and its hand extends as far to each.\"'3 To interpret the Bail \nReform Act as requiring district courts to permit wealthy defendants \nto employ privately funded armed \nguards where an otherwise \nsimilarly \nsituated \ndefendant \nwithout means would be detained \nwould violate \nthis core principle. Such \na two\n-tiered \nsystem \nwould \n\"foster \ninequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small \ncohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy.\n\"14 \nThat said, the private-security condition \nwe described in \nSabhnani may be appropriate where the defendant is deemed to \nbe a \nflight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant \nmay be \nreleased on such a condition \nonly where, but for his wealth, \nhe would not have been detained. By contrast, if a similarly situated \ndefendant of lesser means would \nbe detained, a wealthy defendant \n12 United States v. Banki, 369 F. App'x 152, 154 (2d Cir. 2010) \n(non-\nprecedential summary order). \n\"  Smith v. Bennett, 365 \nU.S. 708, 714 (1961). \n11  United States v. Zarrab, No. 15 CR 867, 2016 WL 3681423, at \n•13 \n(S.D.N.Y. \nJune 16, \n2016) (Richard M. Berman, J.). \n7 \nEFTA00024839\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page8 of 10 \ncannot \navoid detention \nby relying \non his personal funds \nto pay for \nprivate detention. Such a \nlimitation on private-security conditions \nensures that the standards of the Bail Reform Act are applied \nequitably to all defendants. \nIn the instant appeal, Boustani does not challenge the \nDistrict \nCourt's finding that he \nposes a risk \nof flight. Instead, he argues that \nthe District Court erred in finding that no conditions or combination \nof \nconditions would \nreasonably assure \nhis appearance \nin \ncourt. \nIn ruling on Boustani's initial bail application, the District \nCourt \nfound that he \nposes a \nrisk of flight \nbased on \nseveral factors.15\nFirst, the District Court noted the \nseriousness of the charged offenses \nand the \nlengthy possible sentence \nBoustani \nwould face if convicted.16\nSecond, without drawing any conclusions about the merits of \nthe \ncase, the District Court found \nthat the evidence against Boustani \n\"appears strong.\"\n17 Third, the \nCourt considered \nBoustani's personal \ncharacteristics, including his \n\"alleged deceptive actions, access to \nsubstantial financial resources, frequent international travel, \ncomplete lack of ties to the United States, and \nextensive ties to foreign \ncountries \nwithout \nextradition.\"18 Having \nevaluated \"the \ntotality of \n15 \nUnited States v. Boustani, \n356 F. Supp. 3d 246, \n252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), \nard, No. \n19-344, 2019 WL 2070656 (2d Cir. Mar. 7, 2019). \n161d. at 252. \n17 1d. at \n253. \n181d. at \n255. \n8 \nEFTA00024840\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019, 2621854, Page9 of 10 \nthe circumstances,\" the District Court found that \"the Government \nhas shown by a \npreponderance of \nthe \nevidence\" that Boustani \nposes \n\"a serious risk \nof flight.\"19\nThe District Court further found that the Government had \nsatisfied its burden \nof showing that no \nconditions or \ncombination of \nconditions could reasonably assure \nBoustani's appearance \nin \ncourt. \nThe District Court noted, among other considerations, that releasing \nBoustani to \na privately funded jail would lead to disparate treatment \nbetween him and his \nco-defendants, who \nmight \npose flight risks for \nsimilar reasons but lack the financial resources available to \nBoustani.2° \nBoustani's amended bail application did not alter the District \nCourt's conclusions that \nBoustani poses a flight risk and that no \nconditions or combination of conditions would reasonably assure his \nappearance \nin \ncourt. \nThe District Court's findings are not clearly erroneous. It \nis \nclear that the District Court did not rely primarily on Boustani's \npersonal wealth in finding that he posed a flight risk. Rather, his \nwealth was one of many factors the Court considered. A similarly \nsituated defendant of lesser \nmeans surely \nwould be \ndetained pending \ntrial, and Boustani is not permitted to avoid such a result by \nrelying \non his own financial resources to pay for a private jail. \n19\n1d. \n20 Id. at \n258. \n9 \nEFTA00024841\n\nCase 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019, 2621854, Pagel0 of 10 \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing \nreasons, the District Court's order \nof \nMarch \n28, 2019, was \naffirmed by order \non May 16, \n2019. \n10 \nEFTA00024842",
