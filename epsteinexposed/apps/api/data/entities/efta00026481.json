I appreciate his staying true to his word.

The Times is hearing that there's some recent activity in the \nDOJ-OIG \ninquiry into management of the MCC that was initiated after Epstein's death. had said a few weeks \nago, in response to a CBS inquiry that I  let them know about, that there's no 'new' inalon, but and \ncolleagues are hearing there has been recent activity in the ongoing inquiry. I asked about this Times \nin (see below), but I  haven't heard back. I'm happy to provide whatever guidance you think appropriate. \nasking because he wants to keep his pledge not to discuss business when you meet. \n> \n----Ori inal Messa e \n> From: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n> Sent: Tuesda , October 19, 2021 1:35 PM \nMallE\n> To: USANYS USANYS)\nSANYS) \n> Cc: (USANYS) \n> Subject: \nRE: Epstein's death \n> FYI, the Times made a similar inquiry today, although they didn't say the investigation has been 'reopened,' \nrather that they're hearing there's been recent activity/interviews in connection with the investigation into the \nmanagement of the MCC. \n> \nOral IvSge \n> \nFrom: =, \n(USANYS) \n<=IMIIM> \n> Sent: Frida , Se tember 24, 2021 1:49 PM \n> To: SANYS Contractor] (USANYS) \n(USANYS)cMMallill\n> Cc: (USANYS) \n> Subject: RE: Epstein's death \n> For your awareness, there is still an ongoing \nDOJ-OIG \ninvestigation that, broadly speaking, is about Epstein's \ndeath, but the focus is on institutional failures and it isn't new -- this has been in existence and moving slowly \nsince the day he died.
