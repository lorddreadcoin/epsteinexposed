    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThe SiAdol Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nNovember 12, 2021 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter seeking clarification on two items from \nthe November I, 2021 pretrial conference. \nFirst, when describing the defendant's ability to cross-examine witnesses who will be \ntestifying under pseudonyms, the Court explained that: \nAll lines of inquiry the defense outlined in its response are available without \ndisclosing specific names of employers or other specifically identifying \ninformation. For example, the defense can probe the genre, nature, and trajectories \nof witnesses' careers without eliciting the specific employer name, but the defense's \ncross-examination should not include specifically identifying information, and \ncounsel must act responsibly doing so. \n(11/01/21 Tr. at 11:20-12:2). The Government seeks clarification before trial about the line \nbetween permissible and impermissible cross-examination about the \"genre\" of witnesses' careers. \nSpecifically, the Government agrees that the witnesses can be cross examined about their \nprofessions (e.g. that they are actors), and the general arcs of those careers (e.g. that they had work, \nor they did not; on a TV show or in a movie). (See Gov't Reply ISO Mot. in Limine, Dkt. No. 393, \nEFTA00010040\n\nPage 2 \nat 17-18).1   But there is no \"particularized need\" to identify the type of movie or TV show (e.g., \nan action movie as opposed to a soap opera). (11/01/21 Tr. at 10:8-11). That information has no \nimpeachment value—the notion that an actor works on one type of show rather than another says \nnothing about her credibility. But it  creates significant risk of identifying the relevant Minor \nVictims and witnesses by narrowing the field of people whose careers match the description \nelicited by the defense at the times elicited by the defense, and in combination with the other \ninformation about them that will be available at trial. \nSecond, the Government seeks clarification that the Court's November 1, 2021 order \npermitting witnesses to testify using pseudonyms or first names includes an order barring \ncourtroom sketch artists from drawing the exact likeness of those individuals. (See Gov't Mot. in \nLimine, Dkt. No. 380, at 16 n.7 (making this request)); see May 6, 2019 Text Order, Raniere, 18 \nCr. 204 \n(NGG) \n(E.D.N.Y.) (\"Sketch artists . . . may not draw exact likenesses of jurors or witnesses \nother than co-defendants should they testify . .\"). It  would defeat the purpose of \nthe Court's \norder if the exact likeness of those witnesses could be drawn and subsequently publicized in the \nmedia. Although courtroom sketch artists might voluntarily elect not to sketch these witness's \nfaces, the Government seeks an order so it can provide certainty to these witnesses in advance of \ntheir testimony. \n'  The Government's proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the \nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although \nthis letter is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed \nredactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the witnesses whom the Court \nhas authorized to testify using pseudonyms or their first names. \nEFTA00010041\n\nPage \n3 \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nCc: Defense \nCounsel (By \nECF) \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00010042",
