SECTION 3771 \nCOMES NOW the Petitioner, \nJANE DOE (hereinafter \"Petitioner\"), by and through her \nundersigned attorneys, pursuant to the Crime Victim's Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 \n(\"CVRA\"), and files this Petition for \nEnforcement in the above styled action as follows: \n1. Petitioner, an adult, as a minor child was a \nvictim of federal crimes committed by \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN (hereinafter \"Defendant\"). These crimes included sex trafficking of \nchildren by fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, use of a  means of interstate commerce to \nentice a minor to commit prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, as well as wire fraud, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. The \nDefendant committed these crimes within the jurisdiction of \nthe Southern District of Florida \nin Palm Beach County, Florida. \n2. \nUpon \ninformation and belief, the Defendant is the subject of a  federal criminal \ninvestigation conducted by the United States of America in the Southern District of Florida. The \nDefendant has recently been prosecuted \nand pleaded guilty, on June 30, 2008, in the Circuit \nCourt for Palm Beach County to various similar state offenses including solicitation of minors \nfor prostitution. \n3. Upon information and belief, the Defendant is engaged in plea negotiations with \nthe Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida concerning federal \ni \nEFTA00013976\n\ncrimes which he is \nalleged to have \ncommitted against minor \nchildren, including the \nPetitioner. \nSuch negotiations \nmay likely result in a \ndisposition of the \ncharges in the next several \ndays. \n4. Under the \nCVRA, before any charges are \nfiled against the Defendant, \nthe \nPetitioner has the rights \n(among others) to notice \nof her rights under the \nCVRA, to confer with \nthe \nprosecutors, and to be treated with \nfairness. As soon as \ncharges are filed, the Petitioner \nhas \nthe rights (among others) to \ntimely notice of court proceedings, \nthe right not to be excluded \nfrom \nsuch \nproceedings, the right to be heard at \nsuch public proceedings \nregarding conditions of \nrelease, any \nplea, and any sentence, the right \nto confer with the attorney for the \ngovernment, the \nright to restitution, \nand the right to be treated with \nfairness and with respect for her dignity \nand \nprivacy. \n5. The Petitioner has been denied her rights in that \nshe has received no consultation \nwith the attorney for the government \nregarding the possible disposition of the charges, no notice \nof any public court proceedings, no \ninformation regarding her right to restitution, and no notice \nof rights under the \nCVRA, as required under law. \n6. \nThe Petitioner \nis in jeopardy of losing her rights, as described above, if the \ngovernment is able to negotiate a plea or agreement \nwith the Defendant without her participation \nand \nknowledge. \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons outlined \nabove, the Petitioner respectfully requests this \nCourt to grant her Petition, and to \norder the United States Attorney to comply with the provisions \nof the CVRA prior to and \nincluding any plea or other agreement with the Defendant and \nany \nattendant proceedings. \n2 \nEFTA00013977\n\nMEMORANDUM \nI. THE \nCRIME VICTIMS' \nRIGHTS ACT MAKES \nCRIME VICTIMS \nINDEPENDENT \nPARTICIPANTS THROUGHOUT \nTHE \nCRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS. \nIn \nOctober 2004, Congress passed \nand the President signed into \nlaw the Crime Victims' \nRights Act, Pub. L. No. \n108-405, 118 Stat. 2251 \n(codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771). \nBecause this \nappears to be \nthe first case involving the Act to come \nbefore this Court, a bit of background \nmay \nbe in \norder. \nA. The CVRA Gives Crime Victims Rights to Participate in the \nCriminal Justice \nProcess. \nCongress passed the \nCVRA \"to give crime victims enforceable rights to participate in \nfederal criminal proceedings.\" Opinion at 14. Congress was concerned that in the \nfederal system \ncrime victims were \"treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept \nin the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not \nhave a place for them.\" 150 CONG. REC. S4262 (Apr. 22, \n2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). \nTo remedy this problem, Congress gave victims \"the simple right to \nknow what is going on, to \nparticipate in the process where the information that \nvictims and their families can provide may \nbe \nmaterial and relevant ... .\" Id. \nThe CVRA gives \nvictims of federal crimes a series of rights, including the right to notice \nof court \nproceedings, to be heard at plea and sentencing hearings, and to reasonably \"confer with \nthe attorney for the Government in the case.\" 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3771(a). Victims also have a \"right \nof access to \nthe terms of a  plea agreement ... .\" In re Interested Party \n1, 530 F.Supp. 2d 136, \n2008 WL 134233 at *7 (D.D.C. 2008). The \nCVRA also assures victims broadly that they will \n\"be treated with fairness.\" 18 U.S.C. § \n3771(a)(8). \n3 \nEFTA00013978\n\nOf course, these \nrights would be of little use to \nmost crime victims unless \nthey were told \nabout them. To \nensure that victims are notified of \ntheir rights, the CVRA directs \nemployees of \nthe Justice \nDepartment \"and other departments \nand agencies of the United \nStates engaged in the \ndetection, investigation, \nor prosecution of crime\" to use their \"best \nefforts to see that crime \nvictims are notified of... the rights described [in the CVRA].\" 18 U.S.C. § \n3771(c)(l) (emphasis \nadded).1 \nB. \nThe CVRA Gives Victims Rights During the \nInvestigation of a Crime. \nThe CVRA \ngives victims rights during \nthe investigation of a  crime. The \nFifth \nCircuit \nrecently reached this \nconclusion, holding: \nThe \ndistrict court acknowledged that \"[t]here are clearly rights \nunder \nthe CVRA that apply before any prosecution is underway.\" \nBP Prods., 2008 WL 501321 at *11, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12893, \nat *36.   Logically, this includes the CVRA's establishment of \nvictims' \"reasonable right to confer with the \nattorney for the \nGovernment.\" 18 U.S.C. §  3771(a)(5).  At least in the posture of \nthis case (and we do not speculate on the applicability \nto other \nsituations), the government should have fashioned a  reasonable \nway to inform the victims of the likelihood of \ncriminal charges and \nto ascertain the victims' views on \nthe possible details of a  plea \nbargain. \nIn re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394 (5'h Cir. 2008). \nThe position that CVRA rights apply before charges have been filed is consistent with the \nJustice Department regulations under the CVRA, which explain that government officials \"must \nadvise a \nvictim [about their rights under the CVRA] ... at the earliest opportunity at which it may \nbe \ndone without interfering with an investigation.\" A.G. GUIDELINES FOR VICTIM AND WITNESS \nFurther \nsupporting this requirement is another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(3), which directs government officials \nto provide victims with \"the earliest possible notice of,\" among other things, \"the \nfiling of charges against a \nsuspected offender.\" \n4 \nEFTA00013979\n\nASSISTANCE 23 (May 2005). And the plain language of the CVRA \nundergirds this conclusion, as \nit applies not simply to prosecutors but to government agencies \"engaged in the detection [and] \ninvestigation ... of \ncrime ... .\" 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1). Indeed, if there were any doubt, the plain \nlanguage of the CVRA extends victims' right to situations \"in which no prosecution is \nunderway.\" 18 \nU.S.C. § 3771(d)(3). \nII. PETITIONER IS A \"VICTIM PROTECTED BY THE CVRA. \nUnder the CVRA the crime victim is defined as \"a person directly and proximately \nharmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense ... .\" 18 U.S.C. Section 3771(e). In \nparticular, Defendant called Petitioner when she was a \nminor over a  telephone (a means of \ninterstate communication) requesting that she perform a  massage in exchange for payment. As \nDefendant \nwell knew, that request was fraudulent, as he not only intended \nto receive a massage, \nbut also intended to have her perform sexual acts in \nexchange for a  cash payment to Petitioner. \nOnly when Petitioner arrived at a Defendant's \nmansion as directed by Defendant, did Defendant \nreveal \nhis true purpose of obtaining sexual favors \nin exchange for payment. This conduct \nviolated 18 U.S.C. § 2422, which forbids using a \nmeans of interstate commerce to knowingly \n\"induce\" or \n\"entice\" a minor \"to engage in prostitution.\" In \naddition, this conduct was both a use \nof \"fraud\" to obtain a  commercial sex \nact, in violation of 18 U.S.0 §  1591, and use \nof wire \ncommunications to perpetrate \na \"scheme and artifice to \ndefraud,\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. § \n1343. \nIt \nappears obvious that Petitioner was \"directly \nand proximately\" harmed by these \ncrimes, \nthereby making her a \nvictim under the CVRA. It  should be emphasized \nthat the CVRA \"was \ndesigned to be a  `broad and encompassing' \nstatutory victims' bill of rights.\" United States v. \n5 \nEFTA00013980\n\nDegenhardt, 405 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1342 (D. Utah 2005) \n(quoting 150 Cong. Rec. S4261 (daily \ned. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of \nSen. Feinstein)). Congress intended the \nCVRA to dramatically \nrework the federal criminal justice system. \nIn the course of construing the CVRA \ngenerously, the \nNinth Circuit observed: \"The \ncriminal justice system has long functioned on \nthe assumption that \ncrime victims should \nbehave like good Victorian children \n-- seen but not heard. The Crime \nVictims' \nRights Act sought to change this by making victims independent \nparticipants in the \ncriminal justice process.\" Kenna v. \nU.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir. \n2006). Accordingly, because the CVRA is remedial legislation, \ncourts should interpret it \n\"liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and intent.\" Elliott Industries Ltd. \nPartnership v. BP America \nProduction Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1118 (10th Cir. \n2005) (noting \nremedial legislation should be \"interpreted liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and \nintent\"). The CVRA itself suggests this conclusion by requiring that courts must treat crime \nvictims with \n\"fairness.\" United States v.  Patkar, 2008 WL 233062 at •3 (D. Haw. 2008) (citing \nUnited States v.  Turner, 367 F.Supp.2d 319, 335 (E.D.N.Y. \n2005)). \nNot only must the \nCVRA as a whole be interpreted liberally, but its definition of \"crime \nvictim\" requires a generous construction. After reciting the direct-and-proximate-harm language \nat issue here, one of the Act's two co-sponsors -- Senator Kyl -- explained that \"[t]his is  an \nintentionally broad definition because all victims of crime deserve to have their rights protected \n.\" 150 Cong. Rec. 510912 \n(Oct. 9, 2004) (emphasis added). The description of the victim \ndefinition as \"intentionally broad\" was in the course of floor colloquy with the other primary \nsponsor of the \nCVRA and \ntherefore \ndeserves \nsignificant weight. See \nKenna, 435 F.3d at \n1015-16 \n(discussing \nsignificance of CVRA sponsors= fl\noor statements). \n6 \nEFTA00013981\n\nThe \ndefinition \nof \n\"crime \nvictims\" \nmust \nthus \nbe \nconstrued \nbroadly \nin \nfavor \nof \nPetitioner. \nShe \nobviously \nqualifies \nas \na \n\"victim\" \nunder \nthe \nCVRA. \nIII. \nPETITIONER \nIS \nENTITLED \nTO \nNOTICE \nOF \nHER \nRIGHTS, \nAN \nOPPORTUNITY \nTO \nCONFER \nWITH \nTHE \nPROSECUTORS \nAND \nTO \nBE \nTREATED \nWITH \nFAIRNESS. \nBecause \nPetitioner \nis \na \n\"victim\" \nunder \nthe \nCVRA, \nshe \nhas \ncertain \nprotected \nrights \nunder \nthe \nAct. \nMost \nimportant, \nthe \nAct \npromises \nthat \nshe \nwill \nhave \nan \nopportunity \nto \n\"confer \nwith \nthe \nattorney \nfor \nthe \nGovernment \nin \nthe \ncase.\" \nTo \ndate, \nPetitioner \nhas \nnot \nbeen \ngiven \nthat \nright. \nThis \nraises \nthat \nvery \nreal \npossibility \nthat \nthe \nGovernment \nmay \nnegotiate \nand \nconclude \na \nplea \nagreement \nwith \nthe \nDefendant \nwithout \ngiving \nPetitioner \nher \nprotected \nrights.2 \nPetitioner \nis \nentitled \nto \nhave \nthis \nconference \nwith \nprosecutors \nbefore \nany \nfinal \nplea \nagreement \nis \nreached. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nreached \nexactly \nthis \nconclusion \nin \na \nvery \nrecent \ncase. \nIn \nIn \nre \nDean, \n527 \nF.3d \n391 \n(5\nth\n \nCir. \n2008), \nthe \nGovernment \nnegotiated \na  \nplea \nagreement \nwith \nthe \nwell-heeled \ncorporate \ndefendant \nwithout \nconferring \nwith \nthe \nvictims. \nWhen \nthe \nGovernment's \nfailure \nwas \nchallenged \nin \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded \nthat \nthe \nGovernment \nhad \nindeed \nviolated \nthe \nCVRA. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nobserved: \n\"In \npassing \nthe \n[CVRA], \nCongress \nmade \nthe \npolicy \ndecision\n-which \nwe \nare \nbound \nto \nenforce\n-that \nthe \nvictims \nhave \na  \nright \nto \ninform \nthe \nplea \nnegotiation \nprocess \nby \nconferring \nwith \nprosecutors \nbefore \na \nplea \nagreement \nis \nreached.\" \nId. \nat \n394. \nThis \nCourt \nis \nobligated \nto \nprotect \nthe \nrights \nof \nPetitioner. \nThe \nCVRA \ndirects \nthat \n\"[i]n \nany \ncourt \nproceeding \ninvolving \nan \noffense \nagainst \na \ncrime \nvictim, \nthe \ncourt \nshall \nensure \nthat \nthe \n2 \nOn \ninformation \nand \nbelief, \nroughly \nthe \nsame \ncrimes \nwere \ncommitted \nagainst \nseveral \nother \nyoung \nfemales. \nThese \nvictims, \ntoo, \nare \nin \ndanger \nof \nlosing \ntheir \nright \nto \nconfer \nunder \nthe \nCVRA. \n7 \nEFTA00013982\n\ncrime victim is afforded the rights described in [the CVRA].\" 18 U.S.C. §  3771(b)(1).
