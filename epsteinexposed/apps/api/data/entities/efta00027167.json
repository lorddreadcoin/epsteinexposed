See In Re.

Okla. Bar Ass'n v. \nMcGee, 48 P.3d 787, 791 (Okla. 2002) (a lawyer's duty of confidentiality attaches \"to all information relating to the \nrepresentation, whatever its source\"). \nUpon direction of the Court, counsel will file either the redacted or unredacted version of this letter on the public docket. \nBest regards, \nLaura Menninger \nLaura A.
