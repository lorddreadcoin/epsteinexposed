Mao Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York New Tont 10007 \nApril 30, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nMark Manle \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(AJN) \nDear Mr. Manley: \nThe Government writes in response to your letter to the Honorable Alison J. Nathan regarding \nyour client and your request for assurances regarding ensuring your client's anonymity \nin upcoming criminal proceedings, including in documents or information that identifies your client. \nAs an initial matter, the Government notes that to date, there have been no filings on the public \ndocket in the above-captioned criminal case that name your client. Second, to the extent the \nGovernment has produced documents with your client's name to the defense pursuant to its disclosure \nobligations in this criminal case, those materials have been designated as confidential and are \ngoverned by the Protective Order in this case (Dkt. No. 36). Pursuant to the Protective Order, the \ndefense is prohibited from filing publicly any confidential information referenced in the discovery \nmaterials, unless authorized by the Government in writing or by order of the Court. The defense has \ncomplied with this requirement of the Protective Order and has indicated that it will continue to do \nSO. \nAs to the upcoming criminal trial in this matter, the Government notes that it does not intend \nto call your client as a  witness at trial. As a courtesy,' we note that your client's name may arise \nAs a general matter, the Government is not obligated to provide a detailed preview to the defense, \nor third parties, about how it expects to prove its case at trial. \nEFTA00031609\n\nPage 2 \nduring the public testimony of witnesses and may be listed on public exhibits introduced at trial. See \nUnited States v. Akhavan, 20 Cr. 188 (JSR), 2021 WL 1216909, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. I, 2021) (\"[T]he \npublic has a similar right to access documents presented to the jury, and in criminal cases, this right \nstems from not only the common law, but also the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a 'public trial.' \nIndeed, the Second Circuit has explained that 'the public has an especially strong right of access to \nevidence introduced in trials.\"' (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \nFinally, although the Government is mindful of privacy interests of third parties,' we are not \naware of any procedure under United States criminal law that allows third parties to exercise input \nregarding whether or not their names or information about them will be mentioned at a criminal trial, \nnor would it be legally permissible to conduct a trial under seal or preclude public access to a criminal \ntrial. \nRespectfully submitted, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  s/\nAssistant United States Attorneys \nCc: The Honorable Alison J. Nathan (By email) \nDefense counsel (By email) \nThe Government is not presently aware of any authority under which the privacy laws of the United \nKingdom would have any force in this jurisdiction, and your letter cites none. In addition, the \nGovernment respectfully notes that your client is not a victim of child sexual exploitation in \nconnection with this case, and thus the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, does not apply. \nEFTA00031610",
