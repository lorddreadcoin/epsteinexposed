Towards that end, the \nGovernment sent a  proposed set of \nstipulated facts to the victims' counsel (Exhibit 1  to this \npleading) and, in turn, the victims' sent \na  responsive letter raising concerns about some of \nthe Government's proposed stipulated facts \nand suggesting some additions and modifications (Exhibit 2  to \nthis pleading). The victims also \nrequested copies of two relevant documents from the Government: \n(1) the Non-Prosecution \n1 \nEFTA00013570\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 19 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n08/01/2008 Page 2 of \n16 \nAgreement with defendant Epstein that is at the center of this litigation and (2) the FBI's report \nof interview concerning a  meeting with Jane Doe #1. These requests were also made in several \ntelephone conversations with the attorney for the Government. Remarkably, rather than respond \nto the victims' suggestions, the Government has now suddenly reversed course and filed a  terse \ndocument claiming an \"absence of a  need\" for an evidentiary hearing. If anything, however, the \nvictims' discussions with the Government have made clear that the Court should not enter \njudgment for the Government but rather should enter immediate judgment for the victims that the \nGovernment \nviolated \ntheir \nrights \nunder the \nCVRA. The \nCourt \nshould then \nschedule \na \nhearing to \ndetermine the proper remedy for the \nviolation of the victims' rights. \nIn particular, the Government now apparently admits that the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement it struck with Epstein in September 2007 contained an \"express confidentiality \nprovision.\" See Exhibit 1  to this pleading, Government's Proposed Stipulated Facts, at page 3, \nparagraph 6. Assuming \nthat the \nGovernment honored \nits agreement with the \ndefendant (a fact \nthat the victims have proposed to stipulate to), the Government could not have \"conferred\" with \nthe victims about the proposed arrangement over the next nine months because doing so would \nhave violated its confidentiality obligations with the defendant. As a  result, the Government \nplainly has not afforded the victims' their right to \"confer\" about the proposed arrangement under \nthe Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). In addition, the Government \neffectively misled the victims that it  had reached a  Non-Prosecution Agreement with Epstein, \nplainly violating the victims' rights to be treated with \"fairness\" under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. \n§3771(aX8). The Court should therefore find that the victims' rights have been violated. \nThe \nCourt should also order the Government to produce the Non-Prosecution Agreement \n2 \nEFTA00013571\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 19 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 08/01/2008 \nPage 3 of 16 \nto the victims. The victims are entitled to know what disposition has been made in their case. \nMoreover, that Agreement purportedly contains provisions \npertaining to the civil liability of \nEpstein \nfor crimes he has committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. Epstein \nobviously \nknows what those provisions are. \nThe victims are entitled to see those provisions and the \nsurrounding \ndocument as well. \nThe Court should also order the \nGovernment to produce a report of interview with Jane \nDoe #1 \nfrom about October 26, 2007, during which the Government \napparently claims that it \ndiscussed the plea arrangement with the victims. \nFinally, after \nthese documents are produced to the victims and \nthe Court enters judgment \nthat the victims' rights have been violated, the \nCourt should schedule a  hearing to determine the \nappropriate remedy for the violations of the victims' rights. \nTHE \nVICTIMS' PROFFERED FACTS \nThe Government's latest submission takes the \nposition that \"after consideration\" it is now \nunnecessary to hold an evidentiary hearing. \nThe Government apparently believes that the Court \ncould rule \nin its favor based on just two submitted undisputed facts. In taking this position, the \nGovernment apparently believes that there are no set of facts that could sustain \njudgment for the \nvictims. To the contrary, \nhowever, the available facts require judgment for the victims that their \nrights under the CVRA have been violated. \nHaving \nattempted to confer with the Government \nabout the facts in this case, counsel for \nthe victims \nrespectfully submit the following —  and more complete -- set of \nfacts that, on \ninformation and belief, they could establish if given the opportunity to do so: \nIn 2006, \nat the request of the Palm Beach Police Department, the Federal Bureau of \n3 \nEFTA00013572\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument \n19 \nEntered \non \nFLSD

through telephones \nconversations \nhad between Mr. Edwards and AUSA that the U.S. \nAttorney's Office \nand Epstein might be in the process of finalizing some sort of plea arrangement. Accordingly, \nthey filed an emergency motion seeking to protect their rights under the CVRA, including in \nparticular their right to confer about the proposed plea arrangement. \nMr. \nEdwards —  and thus his clients -- first learned of the Non-Prosecution Agreement on \nor after July 9, 2008, when the Government filed its responsive pleading to Jane Doe's \nemergency petition. That pleading was the first public mention of the non-prosecution agreement \nand the first disclosure to Mr. Edwards and his clients. Epstein, through his attorneys, knew that \nthe victims had not been informed about the plea arrangement. \nOn July 9, 2008, AUSA sent a  victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her \nattorney, Mr. Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6  to the 111111 \nDeclaration. That \nnotification contains a written explanation of some of the terms of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office. A full copy of the terms was not \nprovided. This was the first time that Jane Doe #1 was told that the arrangement blocked any \npossibility of federal criminal charges being filed against Epstein. A notification was not \nprovided to Jane Doe #2 because the agreement limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the \nUnited \nStates was prepared to name in an indictment. \nOn July I I, 2008, the Court held a hearing on the victims' emergency motion. During the \nhearing, the Government discussed in open court various provisions of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement. At the conclusion \nof the hearing, victims' counsel and the Government agreed to \n8 \nEFTA00013577\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 19 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008 Page 9 of 16 \nconfer in an effort to \ndetermine the undisputed facts of the fact. \nThe Court took the motion under \nadvisement. \nOn July 16, 2008, the \nGovernment sent to Mr. Edwards a \nproposed set of undisputed \nfacts, which is attached to this pleading as Exhibit 1. \nOn July 17, 2008, Mr. \nEdwards sent a response to the \nGovernment, which is \nattached to \nthis pleading as Exhibit 2. The \nresponse made various \nsuggestions to the proposed undisputed \nfacts. The response also \nrequested a copy of the Non\n-Prosecution Agreement and the \nReport of \nInterview with Jane Doe #1. \nOn \nJuly 29, 2008, rather than \nattempt to work with \nvictims' counsel to draft a  set \nof \nundisputed facts, the \nGovernment filed its \"Notice to \nCourt Regarding Absence of \nNeed for \nEvidentiary Hearing.\" \nAt all \ntimes material to this \nstatement of facts, it  would have \nbeen easily practical and \nfeasible for the Federal \nGovernment to inform Jane Doe #1 and \nJane Doe #2 of the details of \nany \nproposed plea agreement with \nEpstein, including in particular \nthe details of the Non\n-Prosecution \nAgreement. The reason that AUSA yin \nand the FBI agents acting with her \ndid not provide \nthis information to \nJane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 \nwas because of the express \nconfidentiality \nprovision \nthat had been entered into by the \nFederal Government and Epstein. \nThis provision \nwas requested by Epstein. \nThe Government was under no \nobligation to enter into such an \narrangement and would \nhave been statutorily \nforbidden from entering into \nsuch an arrangement \nby the CVRA's requirement \nthat it \"confer\" with the victims \nabout any disposition of their \ncases. \n9 \nEFTA00013578\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 19 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 08/01/2008 \nPage 10 of 16 \nTHE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE \nDIRECTED TO \nCONFER \nWITH \nTHE \nVICTIMS \nREGARDING THE UNDISPUTED FACTS OF THE CASE \nThe Government should be directed to confer with the victims about the facts in this case, \nrather \nthan allowed to \nobscure \nthe \nfacts with its \nproposed \"notice\" that an \nevidentiary \nhearing is \nunnecessary. The reason that the Government abruptly \nterminated discussions about the facts \nwith the victims seem obvious: The \nfacts, if revealed, would plainly demonstrate that the victims \ndid not receive their right under \nthe CVRA to confer with the Government and to be treated \nfairly. The victims \nwill not repeat all of their arguments from their earlier pleadings but would \nsimply highlight for the Court the point that this case already reeks of favored \ntreatment for a \nbillionaire sex offender who has \nsubstantial influence. Regardless of how the Court proceeds, it \nshould at least do so on the basis of fully \ndeveloped factual record so that the victims and the \npublic can be assured \nthat justice has been done. \nIf anything, the facts in this \ncase now call for immediate judgment in favor of the victims. \nBased on the Government's proposed stipulated facts (Exhibit 1   to this \npleading), it is now \nobvious that the \nGovernment could not have fulfilled its statutory obligations to confer with the \nvictims. As now admitted \nby the Government, in September 2007, it  had entered into a  Non-\nProsecution Agreement with Epstein containing \nwhat it  describes as \"an express confidentiality \nprovision.\" While the Government has refused to disclose the text of this \nprovision (or, indeed, \nthe Non-Prosecution \nAgreement itself), it is apparent that the Government could not have \nconferred with the victims about the Agreement while abiding by the confidentiality provision. \nLikewise it is now apparent that the Government has not fulfilled its statutory obligation \nto treat the victims with fairness.

To \nprotect the victims' right to be \ntreated with fairness, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), it should be required to do so now. \nCongress' \nmain concern in passing the CVRA was that crime victims were \n\"treated as \nnon-participants in a critical event in their \nlives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too \nbusy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not have a place \nfor them.\" 150 \nCONG. REC. 54262 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). \nTo remedy this problem, \nCongress gave \nvictims \"the simple right to know what is going on, \nto participate in the process \nwhere the \ninformation that victims and their families can provide \nmay be material and relevant ... \n.\" Id. To date, \nJane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 do not know what has happened to \ntheir case, \nbecause they have not been told how it  has been resolved. \nOf course, no possible harm to the \nGovernment can come from the release of the Agreement, as this criminal matter \nis now \nconcluded —  at least from the Government's perspective. \nProduction of \nthe Non\n-Prosecution \nAgreement is also warranted because \nit has \nprovisions \nin it that are designed to benefit \nJane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. As described by the Government, \nthe Agreement contains provisions in it  that preclude Epstein from contesting civil liability for \nthe sex offenses committed against a number of the victims, including Jane Doe # I. \nObviously, \nJane Doe #1 cannot take advantage of this provision if her attorneys are not able to review it. \nJane Doe #1 and \nJane Doe #2 intend to file civil suits against Epstein within the next few days. \nEpstein knows what is in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that may be helpful to him. Jane Doe \n# I  and Jane Doe #2 are entitled to see the Agreement for items that may be helpful to them. \nFinally, Epstein is apparently \ntaking advantage of provisions in the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement to stall \ncivil suits against him. For example, in Jane Doe v.  Epstein et at, No. 08-\n12 \nEFTA00013581\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 19 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008 Page 13 of 16 \n80804-MARRA/JOHNSON (S.D. Fla. \n2008), on July 25, \n2008, Epstein filed a \nmotion for a stay. \nThat motion claims that the civil action is \"a counterpart to a  pending federal criminal action.\" \nThe basis for that claim, so far as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 can tell, is the federal Non-\nProsecution Agreement. Epstein should not be permitted to use provisions in the Agreement to \nhis advantage in private litigation \nwithout disclosing those provisions to the parties he is \nopposing. Indeed, as a  simple matter of fairness to the victims, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) \n(victims right to \"fairness\"), the provisions should be disclosed. \nIn sum, the Court should direct the Government to reveal to the victims what it has done \nto resolve the case by \nordering production of the full Non-Prosecution Agreement and any \naccompanying addenda to the agreement. \nTHE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE \nREPORT OF \nINTERVIEW WITH JANE DOE #1 \nThe Government apparently has a  report of interview \nindicating that two named FBI \nagents met with Jane Doe #1 on about \nOctober 26, 2007. The Government, however, has \ndeclined to produce it. \nThe Government \nshould be directed to produce this information to Jane Doe #1. Of \ncourse, a criminal defendant would be entitled to \nsuch a report. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A) \n& (B). As an innocent victim in this matter, Jane Doe #1 should be treated with at least the same \nconsideration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (victim's right to \"be treated with fairness\"). Jane \nDoe #1 requested this report in her letter regarding the \nproposed stipulated facts (see Exhibit 2 to \nthis filing), a request that the Government has simply ignored. \n13 \nEFTA00013582\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 19 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008 Page 14 of 16 \nAFTER ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR THE VICTIMS' ON THE \nVIOLATION OF THEIR \nRIGHTS, THE COURT SHOULD \nSCHEDULE A HEARING ON THE APPROPRIATE \nREMEDY \nFor the reasons just explained, the \nCourt should enter judgment for Jane Doe #1 and Jane \nDoe #2 on the violations of their rights under the CVRA and order the Government to produce \nthe Non-Prosecution Agreement and the report \nof interview with Jane Doe #1. After doing that, \nthe question then arises as to what is the proper remedy for the violations of victims' rights. \nTo be clear, at this time, the victims seek two things: (1) a  judicial declaration that the \nGovernment violated their rights under the CVRA and an apology from the Government; and (2) \na  hearing to discuss the appropriate remedy under the circumstances. At the same time, the \nvictims are not asking to have any provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement establishing \nliability in a  civil suit to be vacated or declared invalid. Because the possible connection \nbetween these two things raises complex legal issues, the victims respectfully request that the \nCourt order a hearing at which the appropriate remedy can be discussed. The victims also need \nto review the full text of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and any accompanying addenda to \nmake an appropriate determination about the remedy that they wish to pursue. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should find that the Government violated Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2's \nrights under the CVRA to confer and to be treated with fairness during the negotiation and \nconsummation of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. In the alternative, the Court should direct the \nGovernment to confer with the victims regarding what facts are undisputed in this matter and, \nshould material facts actually be disputed, hold an evidentiary hearing regarding those facts. So \nthat the victims can discuss these matters with the Government, the Court should order the \n14 \nEFTA00013583\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument \n19 \nEntered \non \nFLSD \nDocket \n08/01/2008 \nPage \n15 \nof \n16 \nGovernment \nto \nprovide \nto \nthe \nvictims \nthe \nfull \nNon\n-Prosecution \nAgreement \n(and \naccompanying \naddenda) \nthat \nis \ncentral \nto \nthis \nlitigation \nas \nwell \nas \na  \nreport \nof \ninterview \nwith \nJane \nDoe \n#1 \nfrom \nabout \nOctober \n26, \n2007. \nThe \nCourt \nshould \nthen \nhold \na \nhearing \non \nthe \nproper \nremedy \nfor \nthe \nviolations \nof \nthe \nvictims' \nrights. \nDATED \nthis \n1st \nday \nof \nAugust,\n \n2008. \nRespectfully \nSubmitted, \nTHE \nLAW \nOFFICE \nOF \nBRAD \nEDWARDS \n& \nASSOCIATES, \nLLC \nBy: \ns/ \nBrad \nEdwards \nBrad \nEdwards, \nEsquire \nAttorney \nfor \nPetitioners \nFlorida \nBar \nNo. \n542075 \n2028 \nHarrison \nStreet \nSuite \n202 \nHollywood, \nFlorida \n33020 \nTelephone: \nFacsimile: \nE\n-Mail: \nPaul \nG. \nCassel \nAttorney \nfor \nPetitioners \nPro \nHac \nVice \n332 \nS. \n1400 \nE. \nSalt \nLake \nCity, \nUT \n84112 \nTelephone: \nFacsimile: \nE\n-Mail: \n15 \nEFTA00013584\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 19 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 08/01/2008 \nPage 16 of 16 \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI \nHEREBY CERTIFY that on \nAugust 1, 2008, I \nelectronically filed the \nforegoing \ndocument with the \nClerk of the \nCourt using CM/ECF. \ns/ Brad Edwards \nBrad \nEdwards, \nEsquire \nAttorney for Petitioner \nFlorida \nBar No. 542075 \nSERVICE LIST \nJane Doe 1 \nand Jane Doe 2 \nCase No.: \n08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON \nUnited States \nDistrict Court, Southern \nDistrict of Florida \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n99 \nN.E. 4th Street \nMiami, Florida 33132 \nTelephone: \nFacsimile: \n16 \nEFTA00013585",
