We want to check back in with the estate attorneys, but want to check where we left things \nbefore reaching out. In trying to figure out where things stand, I was looking through our past subpoenas, but couldn't \nfind the subpoena to the estate covering images/videos. Do you know where I can find that? \nThanks, \nEFTA00019312",
