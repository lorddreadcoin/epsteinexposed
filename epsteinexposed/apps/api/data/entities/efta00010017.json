These materials are \nstamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02767074 through SDNY_GM_02771980. \nPlease note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, \n2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as \"confidential,\" because it \nincludes information regarding records designated as \"confidential\" under the Protective \nOrder. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials \nmarked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved \nfor classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this \nproduction under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today \nare marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, \n8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective \nOrder that govern today's production. \nAn index of the materials contained in this production is below: \nEFTA00010017\n\nPage 2 \nBates Start \nBates End Summary Description Confidential Designation \nSDNY GM 02767074 SDNY GM 02771980 Business Records from SDFL Files,Confidential \nAlthough the Government believes that all of these materials are also located in the Florida \nFBI file and were previously produced to from that file in the fall of 2020, out of an abundance of \ncaution, the Government is producing these records to you in the form in which they were stored \nin the files maintained by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. The \nGovernment recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly produce any \nadditional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate to reach out if \nyou have any difficulty accessing these materials. \nVery truly \nyours, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nThese materials appear to be largely duplicative of materials previously produced to you in \ndiscovery. \nEFTA00010018",
