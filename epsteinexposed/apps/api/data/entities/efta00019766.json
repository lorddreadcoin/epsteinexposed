My sense is that some victims may \nbe struggling with the idea that their accusations could remain unvindicated as a result of these events. Is there any \ninformation we might be able to pass along to them and/or their counsel? I'm also free to discuss via phone if that's \nhelpful \nI. \nThank you very much! \nM \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019766",
