WALz (Sanford L. Bohrer, \non the brief) Holland & Knight LLP, New \nYork, NY, for Intervenors Julie Brown and \nMiami \nHonk/ Media \nCompaig. \nAppeal from an order of the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New \nYork (Loretta A. Preska,Judge). \nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, \nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the \nDistrict Court be and hereby is \nAFFIRMED. \nDefendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from a July 23, 2020 order unsealing certain \nlitigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell's April 2016 deposition transcript. \nShe argues \nthat the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the deposition materials. \nSpecifically, she argues that there \nis a lower presumption of access to the deposition materials at \nissue in this case than to the summary judgment materials we ordered unsealed in Brown v. Atwavehc \n929 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 2019), and that her \ninterests outweigh the public's interests. We assume the \nparties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on \nappeal) \nWhen reviewing a district court's \ndecision to seal a filing or maintain such a seal, \"we \nexamine the court's factual findings for clear error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate \ndecision to seal or unseal for \nabuse of discretion.\" Brown, 929 F.3d at 47 (citing Bernstein v.  Bernstein \nLitowitt Berger dr Grossman LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 \n(2d Cir. 2016)). A district court abuses its \ndiscretion if it \"(1) bases its decision on an error of law or uses the wrong legal standard; (2) bases its \ndecision on a dearly \nerroneous factual finding; or (3) reaches a conclusion that, though not \nnecessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding, cannot be located \nwithin the range of \npermissible decisions.\" Klipscb \nGrp. \nInc. v.  Epro E-Commerce Ltd, 880 F.3d 620, \n627 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAlthough Michael Cemovich, DBA Cemovich Media, did not enter an appearance in this \nappeal, letters of his dated July 31, 2020 \nand September 9, 2020 are before the Court. \n2 \nEFTA00018290\n\nCase 20-2413. Document 140-1, 10/19/2020, \n2955244, Page3 of 3 \nWe cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of \nthe deposition materials. While \"the presumption of public access in filings submitted in connection \nwith discovery \ndisputes or motions in Iimine is generally somewhat lower than the presumption \napplied to material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions such as \nmotions for \ndismissal or summary judgment,\" the District Court correctly held that the deposition materials are \njudicial documents to which the presumption of public access attaches, and \ndid not abuse its \ndiscretion in rejecting Maxwell's meritless arguments that \nher interests superseded the presumption \nof access. Brown, 929 F.3d at 50. The District Court's order articulated and \napplied the correct legal \nframework in its individualized review of the materials to be unsealed. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have \nreviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal \nand find them to be without merit We DENY the motion to consolidate this appeal with the \npending appeal \nin United \nStates a \nMaxwell, No. 20-3061-cr. \nFor the \nforegoing reasons, we also \nAFFIRM the July 23, 2020 order \nof the District Court. \nIn the interest of judicial economy, any further appeal in this civil case shall be referred to \nthis panel. \nThe mandate shall issue forthwith. \nFOR THE \nCOURT: \nCatherine O'Hagan \nWolfe, \nClerk \n3 \nEFTA00018291\n\nCase 20-2413.
