A big shout out to for a great job on her first stamping \nproject. We went ahead and stamped the twc productions that are not password locked. The other two \nwe still have to figure out how to open. I've been in contact withMIM.vho has one of the productions that we \nneed. The first files he sent over were corrupted; I'm hoping that the second time is the charm. \n• \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 2:05 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Fourth Production - Scene2Go \nAh got it, sorry I was confused. That plan for marking is fine with me, thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: nay, ep em er , • \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Fourth Production - Scene2Go \nHey \nI believe whaaeant was that we would still be producing everything in the folder but would only stamp select \nfiles; in doing so we'd be avoiding the filler and supporting files which don't contain any viewable data.. My thinking is \nthat we stamp only the folders and leave the files as they are since the structure and contents of the folder are already \nconfusing as is. On something like this, defense will be leaning entirely on the manual that is included for viewing. I fear \nthat if we were to alter file names it would greatly complicate the process of figuring out how to work the files. \nThanks \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 1:51 PM \nTo \nSu jec : :   our ro uc ion -   cene o \nThanks very much for working through this. My preference is to produce everything where possible. Is it possible to \nproduce the entirety of the files and app related to LSJ Scene2Go? We are trying to produce everything we can. \nThanks \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 11:15 AM \nTo: \nEFTA00020862\n\nSubject: Fourth Production - Scene2Go \nHi all, \nI'm bates stamping files within the Fourth Production folder, and one of the items we're going to produce is called \"LSJ \nScene2Go.\" From what I gather, this is an application for viewing 3D maps — in this case, there's a 3D view of the grotto \nand the main structure. When not viewed in the Scene2Go app itself, you can view screenshots of the 3D maps, and I'm \nassuming these images are what we want to produce. \nFor our reference h files .ertainin: \nto the !rotto I \n. nd those \npertaining\nucture ( \nIn each location, \nthe \"map\" and \"scans\" folders contain the viewable files. Within the map folder is an aerial view, and within the scans \nfolder are essentially screenshots of the 3D view of the landscapes. Each view is saved 7 different times, each increasing in \nsize. For the sake of easy review, I think that only the largest (and highest quality) images should be stamped, instead of \nstamping every duplicate. \nThis looks similar to the issues we faced with the Second Production, as the vast majority of files within the larger \nScene2Go folder are system- or application-generated files that simply accompany the files (in this case, scans and maps \nof the grotto and the main structure) that are actually viewable and of interest. I'm thinking it would be best to just stamp \nthese viewable files, along with the Scene2Go user manual (for context), but of course I wanted to run this by you all first. \nI'll defer to your better judgement I \nI'm happy to talk this over further as well — thank you so muchl \nEFTA00020863",
