The drive will be ready \ntomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming weekend, but \nno one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that Maxwell would not \nreceive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to pick the drive up from our \noffice and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. Would that be permissible? \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00013267\n\nEFTA00013268",
