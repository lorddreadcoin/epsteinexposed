Indyke et al., \nSDNY Case No. I :20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF \nDate: Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:25:32 +0000 \nNo problem! Good luck with everything. I don't think there's any hard deadline on the request because we're not in court \nand they didn't send a subpoena. So the main constraint is Glassman's annoyance. I wrote him a brief note back last night, \nalthough I doubt that will keep him happy for very long. I try not to provide specific timelines on stuff like this, but if we \nneed too much more time I can try letting him know a more specific sense of timing. Thanks! \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, June 30, 2020 1:38 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request); Jane Doe v. Indyke et al., SDNY Case No. \n1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF \nHey I apologize for the delay —  our entire team has been absolutely swamped for the past two weeks; we indicted \nGhislaine Maxwell yesterday and now are working on arrest plans, and it's been insane. I very much hope to be able to \ntake care of this next week, it's just been one thing after another for a little while. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, June 28, 2020 23:06 \nTo: \nSubject: Fwd: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request); Jane Doe v.

I will write Glassman back and \ntell him that I hope to follow up soon. \nThanks, \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Robert Glassman \nDate: June 26, 2020 at 12:49:19 AM EDT \nTo: (USANYS)\" \nCc:\" \"Nathan Werksman\" \n>, Keilah Betts < \nSubject: Re: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request); Jane Doe v.
