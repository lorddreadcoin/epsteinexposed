This information pertains to the helicopters that we \ndiscussed, including N491GM (for which we are still uncertain on the exact dates of ownership.) I hope that there is some \nuseful information in here. Hopefully, you have someone who is good with Excel. That's the best way to be able to analyze \nor quickly find the information you might be looking for. \nI have included a few notes here to help you understand the information, but if you have questions, you can give me a \ncall. \nThe first thing you are probably going to wonder about are the dates which are part of the Dept Time, Dest Time columns, \nbut also system tracking dates (more easily understandable) all the way to the right. You'll eventually notice that the \nearliest information on this batch of information is from 2007. It was around that time that we started keeping these \nrecords. \nThe Airport Codes are the ICAO codes. The easiest way to figure out the departure and destination is to either google the \nairport identifier or use the list at this site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO airport code \nAll airports in the continental US begin with the ICAO code K. So if you see a three letter code, it is likely in the US, and \nwould be prefaced with \"K\" in the ICAO code. For example, BOS (Boston Logan International Airport is KBOS). JFK is KJFK. \nAll times (DEPT TIME, DEST TIME, ETA) are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) which we use in aviation. The format in \nthese columns is: CDDTTTT. \"C\" is an internal code, \"DD\" is the day, and \"TTTT\" is the time, UTC, in 24-hour format. \nDEPT DOM and DEST DOM reflect whether the Departure or Destination locations are Domestic. This should provide \nsome context for the airport codes, but I left that in, since international flights should have (are required to file) eAPIS \ninformation, and these columns might make it easier for you to find those flights. \nThe FIX column isn't likely to be very helpful, but it refers to navigational fixes. It could provide additional clues to \nunderstanding where the flight went, but your best bet is to focus on the Dept and Dest. FIX has some very specific \nscenarios where it may be useful, but generally speaking it isn't worth a lot of time and energy, since the dept./dest. and \ntimes and dates are more relevant. The same is true with the ROUTE column. \nThe MSG TYPE corresponds to the following Codes: \nARR - Arrival \nAM Amendment \nCHG Change \nCNL Cancel \nDEP Departure \nDFP Defense Flight Plan (DVFR) \nDM Departure \nFP Flight Plan \nFPL Flight Plan \nLCM Lockheed Message (normally that a callsign received a verbal briefing) \nUZ Border crossing \nHopefully you will all be able to find some decent leads or solidify some of your timelines of interest based on the \ninformation provided. \nV/r, \nEFTA00027585\n\nSpecial Agent \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) \nFederal Aviation Administration, AXE-810 \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, January 14, 2020 11:26 AM \nCo:—\nCc\nSubject: RE: Aircraft info \nPlease call when you get this information. \nI have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is \njust the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think \nthere is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in \ncourt. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, \nand leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or \nmore, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. \nI have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. \nI have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PH. I will send the password in a follow-on e-\nmail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I \nhave created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate \npotentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I \ncreated turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be \nobtained at a later date. \nAs I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly \ndifferent from what was included in the original e-mail to me below. \nN722JE \nnicknamed Air Ghislaine 2 \nHelicopter \nSikorsky S-76C \nAircraft Serial Number: 760750 \nDate Current Registration issued: 17 July 2019 \nCurrent Registered Owner: Hyperion Air LLC \nCurrent Registration Signed By: Lawrence P.

Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft \ninformation. \nBelow are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while \nthe jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she \ntraveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger \nmanifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not \navailable. As you can imagine, this case is high profile, so I appreciate any discretion you can make on your part. \nPlease let me know if I left something out that would be able to assist you in any way. \nThanks again, \nSpecial Agent \nFBI New York \nChild Exploitation/Human Trafficking \nEFTA00027587\n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, December 06, 2019 1:02 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Aircra t in o \nHello! \nBelow is the info for the helicopters and the private jet. \nName: Ghislaine Noelle Maxwell \n•  Certificate: Private Pilot \n•  Date of Issue: 10/2/2007 \n•  Helicopter: Rotorcraft \no Sikorsky S-76C; nicknamed Air Ghislaine 2 \n•  Likely Serial Number: 760750 \no States certificate was issued on 7/17/2019 \n•  Helicopter Info: \n•  Tail Number: N722JE \n•  Type: 2008 Keystone Helicopter S-76C \n•  Prior Registration: Freedom Air International Inc, 103 Folk Rd St 202 Wilmington, DE 19803 \n•  Old Tail Number: N331JE \no Serial Number: 49078 \no States certificate was issued on 9/6/2013 \n2nd Helicopter: \n•  Bell Jet Ranger \n•  Tail Number: N491GM \n•  Nicknamed: Air Ghislaine 1 \nPrivate Jet: \n•  Tail Number: N2121E \no Serial Number: 5173 \no Type: GV SP (G550) Fixed Wing Multi Engine \no Certificate Issued: 3/31/2017 \n•  Tail Number: N1201E \no Serial Number: 1085 \no Type: G-IV Fixed Wing Multi Engine \no Certificate Issued: 5/30/2013 \n•  Tail Number: N9091E \no Serial Number: 151 \no Type: G1159B \no Certificate Issued: 11/18/2013 \n•  Tail Number: N9081E \no Serial Number: 20115 \no Type: Boeing 727-31 \no Certificate Issued: 1/25/2001 \nLet me know if you need anything else, \nEFTA00027588",
