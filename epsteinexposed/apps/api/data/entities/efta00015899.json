The MDC computer turns \noff every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume \nof discovery \nmay be too taxing for the operating system. \nWe also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's \nconditions and restrictions. \nThe constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current \nshift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening. \nMs. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell \nto accommodate \ncapture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small \nconfinement area. \nHer use of the \nlaptop has been restricted. \nShe is invasively surveilled while showering. \nHer cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. \nOver the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was \nremoved leaving her cold; and she now has \nthe onset of a cold. \nThe blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by \ncounsel. \nThe open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches \ncontinue, \nwith more frequently than other inmates are searched. \nHer cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her \nlegal work and an invasion into her privileged work \nproduct. \nShe has \nnot received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail \n(return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. \nWe will keep you \napprised of our concerns. \nYour assistance \nis appreciated. \nBest-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
