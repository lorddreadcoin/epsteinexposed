Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nFrom: \n(USAFLS) \nSent: Thursday, June 17, 2010 3:52 PM \nTo: \nCc:  \nSub : FW: PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL \nHopefully you had a good trip. I assume we cannot answer any of these questions, but please let us know. Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, June 17, 2010 3:49 PM \nThank you for calling me today. I am confused about certain legal issues. When I ask erl  his \nmorning why Jeffrey Epstein was not charged with child sex trafficking given the 2000 TVPA federal laws, she \nEFTA00019173\n\ndid not want to respond. It s an important question that merits a substantial answer. \nIn light of the arguments surrounding the case I would like to know: \nI. Why was Jeffrey Epstein allowed to plead guilty to a single count of solicitation of minors to engage in \nprostitution? \n2. In light of the 5 trafficking offenses outlined on pages 1 & 2 of the NPA signed 10/29/07, why was Epstein \ngiven a twelve (12) months and six (6) months in a county jail (he served only 13 months), for all charges \nwithout adjudication or sentencing, and without probation or community control? \n3. Unlike any other registered sex offender in the U.S. prison system today why didn't he serve time in a State \npenitentiary? Why was Epstein placed in a solitary cell at the West Palm Beach Stockade and only part time? \nWhy was he allowed to go to \"work\" outside of prison for 13 months during the entire day? \n4. Why didn't Epstein like all other registered sex offenders in the U.S. have an attached electronic monitor \nduring his house confinement? \n5. Why was prosecution for the offenses deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida? \n6. In the ADDENDUM to the NPA (7A-C), Epstein is given the right to select and approve independent third \nparty counselors for the victims. Why? \n7.According to the NPA signed by MV there are 5 federal trafficking offenses. Why were they dismissed or \ndeferred? \n8. Why is Epstein given the right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between the victims and Epstein? \n9. Esptein's signature on NPA \"is not to be construed as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver \nof...\" Please explain. Why? \n10. What was the \"gain time\" Epstein earned during his period of incarceration? \n11. Why would the NPA not be part of a public record? And why would the US have to provide notice to Epstein \nbefore making disclosure under a FOIA request? \n12. Why was the Federal Grand Jury investigation suspended? \n13. Wh the the US a e not to institute an criminal ch es a  ainst his co cons irators Ghislaine Maxwell, \nn light of the evidence? \n14. Why are the grand jury subpoenas going to be withdrawn at the completion of the terms of the NPA? given \nthat he is a registered sex offender and that most probably he will commit the crimes shortly after his release next \nmonth (this assumption based on empirical and medical data obtained from registered sex offenders), there \nseems to be no protection mechanism for the victims in place? \n15. Why was JE allowed to choose the attorney's for the victims and put a cap on their restitution? \n16. Why was the Federal investigation stopped by the \nUSAG? \n17. Why hasn't Epstein been rearrested given the 11+ parole violations reported to the parole board since his \nhome confinement including weekly trips to NY and helicpter ride to travel only 9 miles? \nSincerely, \nEFTA00019174\n\nThe message and any attachment may be confidential or privileged and is \nintended only for the individual or entity identified above as the \naddressee.
