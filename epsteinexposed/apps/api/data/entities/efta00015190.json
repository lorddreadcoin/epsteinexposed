    "text": "\n\nSTATE OF NEW MEXICO \nOFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL \nHECTOR H. BALDERAS \nATTORNEY GENERAL \nJuly \n8, 2020 \nActing United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nVia email to: \nRe: Request for asset forfeiture of property acquired by Jeffrey Epstein to commit \nhuman trafficking in New Mexico at Zorro \nRanch \nActing United States Attorney M, \nOur office has provided investigative evidence regarding Jeffrey Epstein's use of the Zorro \nRanch, located in Stanley, New Mexico, to assist federal prosecutors. In furtherance of \nachieving some measure of justice for victims of Epstein and his acolytes, I ask that any interests \nbelonging to Epstein's estate or co-conspirators be seized by federal authorities. We believe that \nthis ranch was used by Epstein and others to facilitate the commission and prolonged \nconcealment of his trafficking of children, such that seizure may be pursued in conjunction with \nthe pending criminal prosecution of Epstein's associates and co-conspirators. \nMy priority is to assist federal prosecution efforts in identifying any and all assets used by \nEpstein and others in New Mexico to facilitate the commission and concealment of his crimes. \nTo this end, we call upon your office to include the improvements of this property and any \nsubstitute assets as part of the civil forfeiture of property associated with any pending cases \nagainst Epstein's estate or involved with the criminal prosecution of his co-conspirators. \nIn the event you need assistance investigating or eventually pursuing this avenue, I  will gladly \noffer the resources my office has available to ensure that all survivors of crimes committed in \nNew Mexico \nreceive some measure of justice, closure, and eventual restitution. \nEFTA00015190\n\nRespectfully, \nClara Moran \nChief Deputy Attorney General \nEFTA00015191",
