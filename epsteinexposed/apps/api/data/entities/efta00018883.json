Mello Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nApril 23, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nMark Cohen, Esq. \nCohen & Gresser LLP \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon. \nMorgan and Foreman, P.C. \nBobbi Stemheim, Esq. \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C. Stemheim \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Counsel: \nPursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government \nhereby provides notice that it  may call as an expert witness at trial Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinical \ninstructor of psychiatry and human behavior at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. \nThe Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide \nnotice if the Government elects to do so. \nI. Disclosure by the Government \nDr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the \nAmerican Psychological Association (\"APA\"). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since \nearning her Ph.D. in 1995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School \nof Brown University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since \nshe entered private practice in 1998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma, \nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio \nhas treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse. \nDr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical \nEFTA00018883\n\nPage 2 \nand forensic psychology. She has written, presented, and taught about the assessment and \ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2014, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review \nboard of the APA journal Trauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is \na  member of the APA Ethics Committee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio's curriculum vitae is being \nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 3502-006.' \nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience, \nand research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by \nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of \nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, \nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern \nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a  variety of forms and function to render the \nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment \nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware \nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may \nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the \nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the \nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological \nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other \nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that \nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for \na  variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted \nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not \nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer \nDr. Rocchio's testimony regarding any specific victim. \nDr. Rocchio's expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological \ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio's \nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in \nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio's experience conducting forensic psychological \nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is \nproducing notes from the Government's interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well. \nII. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice \nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal \nnotice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert \nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that \nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as \nwell as the witness's qualifications. \n'  Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal \nand state litigation. As a courtesy, a  list of that testimony is also being produced to you today \nbearing Bates number 3502-002. \nEFTA00018884\n\nPage 3 \nAdditionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery \nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: \n(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or \ncopies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which \nthe defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or \nreports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in \nconnection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, \nand which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which \nwere prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior \nstatements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. \n26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material \nbe provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with \n3500 material relating to Government \nwitnesses. \nVery \ntruly yours, \nUnited States Attorney \nby: /s/ \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nEFTA00018885",
