    "text": "\n\nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \nTo: \nCc: Christian , \"Mark S. Cohen\" \nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell \n02879-509 \nDate: Tue, 29 Dec 2020 01:41:41 +0000 \nGood \nevening, \nWe hope you \nand your family had a joyful holiday. \nIn response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the laptop, \nin lieu of the MDC computer„ during the typicaL length of time other inmates are permitted out of \ntheir cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to 10:30 pm on weekends.) \nThe voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop. The MDC computer turns \noff every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery may be too \ntaxing for the operating system. \nWe also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's \nconditions and restrictions. \nThe constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and \nrestrictions, the current \nshift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening. \nMs. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell \nto accommodate \ncapture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small \nconfinement area. \nHer \nuse of the laptop has been restricted. \nShe is invasively surveilled while showering. \nHer cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. \nOver the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was removed \nleaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold. \nThe blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was \nmade by counsel. \nThe open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches \ncontinue, \nwith more frequently than other inmates are searched. \nHer cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her \nlegal work and an invasion into her privileged work \nproduct. \nShe has \nnot received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail \n(return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. \nWe will keep you apprised \nof our concerns. \nYour assistance is appreciated. \nBest-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C. Stemheim \nEFTA00015911\n\n••Covid-19 Notice: The West 19th Street office is currently closed but we continue to work remotely. \nPlease use email or fax, instead of regular mail, for all correspondence during this time. \nWe continue to work regular business hours throughout this situation. \nThank you for your consideration.
