Because it's a fairly long flight with a layover, the plan \nwould be to fly out on Monday (4/12), conduct two days of interviews to debrief the victim and discuss testifying at trial, \nand return on Thursday (4/15). Other than flights and a hotel, I don't anticipate any other travel expenses for the trip. \nThanks very much, and hope you're doing well--\nAlison \nEFTA00032929",
