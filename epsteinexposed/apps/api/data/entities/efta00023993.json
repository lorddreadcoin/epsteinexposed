You have \nbeen identified as having done work on or supervised the Epstein matter, and thus as possibly having responsive records. \nPlease note and preserve whatever you have about Mr. Epstein, not limited to his death and to the earlier reported \nincident in which he suffered physical injuries. In addition, to the extent possible, please avoid altering any relevant \nrecords. If you need to use existing documents, please save what you're working off of as a  new document so that the \nversion that now exists remains preserved and available. \nI attach a  formal litigation hold notice, which as required is on an EOUSA-provided form. Please review the notice, fill out \nthe form to indicate whether and where you have responsive records, and sign and return it to me. In particular, be sure \nto let me know by USAO number if possible what records and share directories we have that are likely to include relevant \ninformation. \nI prefer scanned and emailed return of the forms, but you can also use interoffice mail if you prefer. \nPlease let me know if you think other USAO personnel may have relevant documents or evidence. \nAnd please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss. \nFinally, I am copying -to inform him of the new litigation hold, and to ask him to ensure that all responsive \ninformation on our electronic record systems is preserved, including by suspending the routine maintenance email \ndeletions for recipients of this email. \nMany thanks, \nEFTA00023993\n\nDeputy Chief, Civil Division, and Litigation Hold Coordinator \nU.S. Attorney's Office, S.D.N.Y. \n86 Chambers Street, Third Floor \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:46 PM \nSubject: RE: Epstein DIG/FBI—Document Preservation \nFYI, as a result of a preservation request Epstein's lawyers have made on behalf of the family, which indicates a \npotential wrongful death case, you will shortly be receiving a  formal litigation hold request from \nour litigation hold coordinator. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:43 AM \nSubject: FW: Epstein 0IG/F8I--Document Preservation \nAll -  Please see below and follow instructions.
