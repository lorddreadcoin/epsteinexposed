Sternheim \n33 West \n19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(AJN) \nDear \nCounsel: \nYou requested \na copy of the spreadsheets on the hard drives you have reviewed at the FBI \noffice in Denver. Those spreadsheets are embedded with hyperlinks to the images on the hard \ndrives. The Government is not able to provide you with copies of the versions of the spreadsheets \non the hard drives because those spreadsheets are embedded with photographs depicting, among \nother things, child exploitation materials. However, the FBI has prepared a  version of the \nspreadsheets you requested without the embedded photographs, which we are producing to you \ntoday, as listed in the below index. These materials are stamped with control numbers \nSDNY GM 02765031 through SDNY GM 02765061. \nPlease note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, \n2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as \"confidential,\" because it \nincludes information regarding records designated as \"confidential\" under the Protective \nOrder. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials \nmarked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved \nfor classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this \nproduction under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today \nare marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, \nEFTA00020815\n\nPage 2 \n8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective \nOrder that govern today's production. \nAn index of the materials contained in this production is below: \nBates Start \nBates End Summary Description Confidential Designation \nSDNY GM 02765031 SDNY GM 02765061 Spreadsheets Confidential \nVery truly yours, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nby: \ns/ \n\\ssist:int ' ilitcci \nStates Attorneys \nEFTA00020816",
