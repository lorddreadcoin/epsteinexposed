Do we have a time this afternoon when you can meet? Let us know as soon as you can because \nMark will be in court soon and will not have his phone. \nAlso, would you mind asking the CSOs to allow us to bring our phones into the building? Let me know if that's a problem. \nThanks, \nChris \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 15, 2019 7:57 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell; Mark S. Cohen \nCc: \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation (re: Epstein) \nChris, Mark, \nI \nFollowing up on my very brief conversation with Chris earlier this afternoon, and the voicemail you left earlier, thanks for \ngetting in touch regarding your representation of Ms. Maxwell. I understand you'll be in our neighborhood tomorrow \nafternoon; we can make ourselves available to meet, but will that have been enough time for you to speak with your \nclient? Let us know what you think would be best to proceed, and we'll figure out next steps. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021413",
