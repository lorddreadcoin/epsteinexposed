Disciplinary sanctions notwithstanding, all pretrial inmates have the same access to family communications: \nmonitored social visiting, monitored social phone calls, and monitored social mail. While I understand your client is a \ndeath penalty case, there are many inmates at MCC with very complex cases who have legal decisions they need to \ndiscuss with their families, and the methods available to them are the three methods I just mentioned. If a social \nphone call is insufficient, then we will raise the issue again with administrators to see if they will allow a social visit \nduring your client's regular social visiting hours. However, please be advised that once your client returns to general \npopulation with regular phone access, I do not anticipate administrators will be amenable to social visit requests unless \nthey are being used as mitigation evidence. \nI am out of the office starting tomorrow, but Adam will let you know once he discusses it with Exec staff. \nThanks, \nStaff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetropolitan Correctional Center \n150 Park Row \nNew York NY 10007 \n>>> \nBruce \nBarket \n< \n>  8/29/2019 5:15 PM >>> \nI am sorry, but that won't be sufficient. We had a  conversation with and a few weeks back and they \ntold us that, in light of the particular needs for preparation for a capital case, MCC would permit periodic social visits \nas needed. I did not raise this issue with the court because of what we were told. Perhaps I misunderstood. \nBruce A.
