Epstein, \n19 CR 490 (SDNY) \nDear \nJudge Berman: \nIn response to \nrequests from the Court and certain arguments made \nyesterday by the government, we write to supplement Jeffrey Epstein's \nrequest for bail. \nFirst, make no mistake about the crux of the government's \ndetention argument and its necessary implications. Stripped \nto its core, \nthe government's position —  as urged in its letters and echoed \nagain \nyesterday — distills to this: the nominally rebuttable remand \npresumption (connected with 18 USC § 1591 charges) 1 plus Mr. \n1 To be clear, \nEpstein contends that § 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption \ndo not contemplate or cover the \ncore conduct at issue here: performing sexual \nEFTA00014482\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 2 of 9 \nHon. Richard M. Berman \nJuly \n16, 2019 \nPage 2 \nEpstein's wealth creates an irrebuttable \npresumption whereby no \ncondition(s) can reasonably assure personal appearance or protect the \npublic. The Court should reject the government's misguided effort to \neffectively create a  per se rule. 2 Indeed, for the government, there's \nliterally nothing a  person of \nEpstein's means could say, do or pledge to \nrebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for \nrelease. \nThat cannot be the law. Such a  construction turns the statute's \nmassages for money. See Fierro u. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 13042630, at *3 \n(SDNY July 2, 2012) (holding that sex purchasers from minors fall outside § \n1591's \nambit). \n2  E.g., 7/15/19 Tr. 11 (\"even if the defense were able at some point to rebut the \npresumption by providing some more information, there simply is no way that they \ncan meet the standard here\"); 7/12/19 Ltr. 5 (\"even assuming the defendant's assets \nare \npresently in the United States, nothing ... would prevent the defendant from \ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or \nrelocation. The defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades \nof experience in the industry and significant ties to financial institutions and actors \naround the world. He could easily transfer funds and holdings on a moment's [notice] \nto places where the [g]overnment would never find them so as to ensure he could live \ncomfortably while a fugitive.\"); id. (\"even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all \nof his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to \nresume making ... tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the \nUnited States.... \n[T]here \nwould be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown \nassets abroad, \nand then continuing to ... earn his vast wealth from a computer \nterminal beyond the reach of extradition.\") (footnote omitted); id. 7 (\"the notion that \nany individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for this defendant strains \ncredulity\"). \nEFTA00014483\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 3 of 9 \nHon. Richard M. Berman \nJuly \n16, 2019 \nPage 3 \nplain text —  expressly providing that the presumption is \"[s]ubject to \nrebuttal,\" and otherwise mandating bail on the \"least restrictive\" \nconditions that reasonably assure the \ndefendant's presence and \ncommunity safety — on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the \npresumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth \namendment rights to due process, \ncounsel, a defense and equal \nprotection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail —  all \nbased on a  suspect if not \ninvidious classification. To be sure, wealthy \ndefendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly \nshouldn't be singled out for worse treatment — in effect, \ncategorically \ndisqualified from bail, at least in a  presumption \ncase —  on the basis of \ntheir net worth. \nSecond, it \nbears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an \ninsurmountable bar to release in a § 1591 \nprosecution.3 To the contrary, \ncourts have determined that there are suitable conditions under which \n3 E.g., US u. Brinson, No. 13-CR-04-GKF, 2013 \nWL 11305792 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 8, \n2013); US u. Afyare, No. 3:10-er-00260, 2011 WL \n1397820 (M.D. Tenn. April 13, 2011); \nUS u. Gardner, 523 F. Supp. 2d 1025 \n(N.D. Cal. 2007). \nEFTA00014484\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 4 of 9 \nHon. Richard M. Berman \nJuly \n16, 2019 \nPage 4 \ndefendants accused of trafficking minors are bailed —  notwithstanding \nthe remand presumption. \nThird, as apparent from Mr. Epstein's initial financial disclosure, \nMr. Epstein's finances are fairly complex. It would be impossible for Mr. \nEpstein —  given, among other impediments, his detention, inability to \nquickly access \npertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise \nvaluation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement \nby the Court's 5pm deadline. Mr. \nEpstein certainly recognizes the Court's \nrequest for further transparency and is committed to providing a \ncomplete and accurate disclosure. \nAccordingly, we propose that the Court \npreliminarily accept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if \nintending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Mr. Epstein \nto tender a \ncomprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as \nexpeditiously as \npracticable. Joel Podgor, Partner Emeritus at prominent \nManhattan accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, has \nagreed to conduct the \nforensic investigation and prepare a report rapidly. \nAs counsel said during the July 15 argument, Epstein will agree to any \nEFTA00014485\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 5 of 9 \nHon.

(The underlying documents are \navailable upon request.) \nSixth, though some studies may well indicate that sex offender \nrecidivism rates \"actually \ngofl \nup at 15 \nyears,\" as Your Honor suggested \nfrom the bench,5 others reach the opposite \nconclusion. For example, a \nrespected study found that the relapse risk drops substantially the longer \na person remains \nsex-offense free in the community. 6 Another \ndetermined that it's mistaken to think of anyone who's \nbeen offense-free \nfor 15 \nyears as high-risk.? \nSeventh, to the extent third-party counsel (Mr. Boies) speculated \nthat the alleged November 28 and December 3, 2018 \npayments8 were \ns 7/15/19 Tr. \n34. \n6  Hanson et al., \"High-Risk Sex Offenders May Not Be High Risk Forever,\" Journal \nof Interpersonal Violence \n(March 2014), \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/261069441 High. \nRisk Sex Offenders May Not Be High Risk Forever. \n7  Ira Mark & Tara Ellman, \"'Frightening and High': The Supreme Court's Crucial \nMistake About Sex Crime Statistics\" (2015). \nConstitutional Commentary. 419. \nhttps://scholarship.law.umn.edu/concomm/419.\n8  7/12/19 Ltr. 11. \nEFTA00014487\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 7 of 9 \nHon.

As explained in Court, the recipients were \"long-time [Epstein] \nfriends and employees\" 10 — not putative victims — and they never \ncooperated \nwith Mr. Boies. To the contrary, each invoked the Fifth \nAmendment and refused to testify when civilly deposed, respectively, in \nprior New York federal and Florida state civil proceedings. Subject to the \nprotective orders in these \nproceedings, we would be pleased to provide \nrelevant deposition transcripts. \nEighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it \nexpired 32 years ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest — and \ncertainly no evidence —  that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein — \nan affluent member of the Jewish faith —  acquired the passport in the \n1980s, when \nhijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East \ntravel. The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to \ndangerous areas, only to be presented to \npotential kidnapers, hijackers \n9  7/15/19 Tr. 70-71. \nlo \nIbid. 69. \nEFTA00014488\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 22 Filed 07/16/19 Page 8 of 9 \nHon.

In November 2018, media \nreports \nsuggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a \"slap \non \nthe wrist.\" Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) and the prison sentence that Epstein \ncompleted, there can be no dispute that certain witnesses through their \nattorney representatives,11 the media —  e.g., The Miami Herald —  and \nthe public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled \nextensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the \nUnited States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won't flee \nand entitles him to release —  on any and all conditions the Court deems \nappropriate. \n11 See, e.g., Doe u.
