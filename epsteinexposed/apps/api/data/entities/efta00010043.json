Thank you so much! \nSubject: Outside juror research \nHi team, \nave been looking into the jurors proceeding to voir dire (excluding those that were struck today) online, \nwith many thanks to them. A sample of their notes is attached (which hasn't yet been corroborated by the notes I took \ntoday, which I've sent them—for example, if there's two people with the same name, my notes from today should narrow \nit down). \nCan you please let know what would be most helpful to you in advance of tomorrow (e.g., how many \njurors you want them to get through, by what time, etc.)? \nThanks, \nEFTA00010043\n\nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office I SDNY \n1 Saint Andrew's Plaza \nEFTA00010044",
