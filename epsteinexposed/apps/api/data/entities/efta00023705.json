As is the case with any items that were seized during the \nFBI's searches of Epstein's residences in New York and the Virgin Islands, and as noted in my letter dated August 21, 2020, \nif you wish to review those photographs—or any other items from those searches—yourself before that production is \nready, we can schedule a time for you to go to the FBI offices and review them. \nTo the extent you are reiterating your request from yesterday afternoon that the FBI bring a laptop containing those \nimages to the MDC for you and your client to review together, we are already working with the FBI on the logistics of \nloading the files and transporting them to the MDC. Due to the large number files, this will take a few days. I will let you \nknow as soon as those logistics are sorted and the FBI is able to bring the files to the MDC for you and your client to \nreview. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Christian \nEverdell < \nSent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:34 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \nCc: Mark S. Cohen \nSubject: Request \n>; \nFollowing-up on our phone call yesterday afternoon, we request that you make available to Ms. Maxwell as soon as \npossible all of the roughly 40,000 non-nude/non-Highly Confidential images that we discussed on our call and that have \nnot been produced on any of the hard drives. Ms. Maxwell is available to review these images as early as tomorrow. \nPlease let us know the earliest date that these materials can be made available. \nRegards, \nEFTA00023705\n\nChris \nChristian Everdell \nCOHEN &  GRESSER LLP \nNew York I  Seoul I  Paris \nI \nWashington DC I \nLondon \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this e-mail may be confidential and/or privileged.
