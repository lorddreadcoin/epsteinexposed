Could you (or she) please forward us that email (and any letter, etc.) that went out, just so we \nhave those materials and know what they say in case any attorneys call us with questions? \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, October 01, 2019 15:37 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Next steps \n>; \n>; \nis assisting in organizing this with victim services division at headquarters. Victims attorney's \nwere already notified via brief email that they can choose either October 15th at the Miami Field Office or \nOctober 23rd in Manhattan. Our understanding is that this is primarily a victim services brief, which will not \nhave any discussions of substantive case details or status updates.

We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any substantive \nupdate about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we don't want any \nvictims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info. \nWe'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in Nashville \nfrom the 15th through the 18th for a separate work trip, but will check with on their schedules. \nEFTA00021318\n\nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, September 30, 2019 12:57 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Next steps \nIf you have some time today we can chat about these steps at more length but in short... \n1) Sure we can make a photo array but also we have a photo book which we could just addo instead of \nthe 6 pack. \n2) will be on vacation the first week of November but what about the week of October 14?
