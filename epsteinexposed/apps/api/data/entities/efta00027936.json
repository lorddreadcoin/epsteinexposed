OIG requested all of the relevant log slips from BOP this morning. To date, we have received the log for \nthe 30-min checks for Friday night, which shows that the same officer (Officer Noel) signed each of the 30-\nmin checks between 12-6am on 8/10, although there were 8 other officers on duty in the SHU that night. We \nalso received the report that Michael Horowitz referenced last night, which was written by a supervisor (M \nthe report states that wheri responded to Epstein's cell following the emergency call, Officer \nNoel admitted that they did not conduct the 3am or 5am rounds. Another officer, Officer Thomas, then said \n\"we messed up\" and then \"I messed u  , she's not to blame (referring to Officer Noel), we didn't do any \nrounds.\" We are reaching out t oday to set up an interview. We want to approach and interview the \nrelevant officers after we have analyzed the video we seized, as discussed below. \nEFTA00027936\n\n2. There was a camera in the SHU that was pointed at the hallway and would have captured who was entering \nor looking into each cell. However, FBI/OIG was told yesterday by BOP that the camera had not been \nfunctioning since Thursday. FBI seized 18 hard drives of video from BOP and are analyzing them to confirm \nwhether there was in fact any video. We hope to have a preliminary analysis done of the SHU camera by \ntomorrow. \n3. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on 7/29, and was not required to have a cellmate. His cellmate \nwent to Court on Friday and was released from Court. There was not an officer responsible for assigning him \na cellmate because it was not required. CMG has not interviewed any officers; we intend to start with an \ninterview wita as referenced above. \nThe autopsy is happening this morning. We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have \nany questions. \nThanks, \nOn Aug 11, 2019, at 9:58 AM, Berman, Geoffrey (USANYS) wrote: \nOAG has asked us for answers to the questions below, whenever we get them. Perhaps we can run \nthese \nquestions by the OIG agent. \nI assume that in addition to the log for the 30 minute checks that there are also log slips for the two head \ncounts at 3am and 5am. That's what I  was told by BOP. \nWith respect to the video, is there any video in that SHU that would show if the COs did the counts? \nHave they uncovered any information about why the Epstein did not have a cell mate ? Was the CO \nresponsible for assigning Epstein a cell mate interviewed? I understand BOP has not talked to him. \nEFTA00027937",
