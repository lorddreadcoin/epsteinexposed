We appreciate your commitment to a program that is independent of the Estate, which we also \nview as a central feature of any viable alternative to litigation. As I'm sure you can understand, however, a claims \nresolution program in which the three decision-makers were selected and hired by the Estate—and, we presume, are \nbeing paid by the Estate—cannot be said to be independent. In our view, there is a straightforward solution to this \notherwise intractable problem: the program should add a fourth administrator, selected by plaintiffs, and require that all \nclaims decisions are rendered unanimously. \nWe look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We suggest arranging a time to do so before the protocol is \nfinalized, since it will be important to incorporate the input of an additional administrator into that process. We will, of \ncourse, also raise this with the Estate. \n'r\n(\"Robbie\") EIM, Esq. \neeler & Fink LLP \n350 Fifth Avenue I  Suite 7110 \nNew York.

I hear your concerns and want to reiterate that this proposed Program is entirely voluntary and \nindependent of the Estate. It in no way imposes a process or outcome on the victims, and will in no way be administered \nor controlled by the Estate. Those are signature features of the Program. \nAs I mentioned in my email last week, Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a claims protocol and plan to \ncirculate it - in draft form — to you and your counterparts before the holidays, and welcome any input you may have at \nthat time. We will provide ample time for you to review and respond to the draft protocol, and will be happy and \navailable to discuss your comments before the protocol is finalized. \nWe look forward to speaking with you. \nRegards, \nJordy \nFrom: L.

Laura Starr \nEFTA00027913\n\n•  Andrew \nBuzin < ; \nGloria Allred \n; Colleen Mullen \nSubject: RE: Epstein Victims' Compensation Program \nOn \nbehalf of \nJordy, \nThank you for reaching out to us. We are writing back on behalf of (and copying) certain plaintiffs' counsel who \nappeared at an SDNY conference last week for sexual abuse survivors of Epstein. We intend no disrespect to \nyou and your colleagues, but, candidly, we have serious concerns about the Estate's purported decision to \nimpose a  non-binding settlement process on our clients unilaterally. All of these women still struggle today \nbecause of the profound manipulation, objectification, and physical abuse to which Jeffrey Epstein subjected \neach of them. Regardless of your own significant experience and good intentions, the fact that the Estate chose \nan administrator without any participation, input, or consideration of our clients' views or wishes is \ndisconcerting, particularly given the personal nature of the claims at issue. \nWe are, of course, interested above all in advancing our clients' interests. As you may know, at a status \nconference last week in the Southern District, Magistrate Judge Freeman instructed counsel for the Estate and \ncounsel for plaintiffs to engage in good faith discussions about any proposed claim resolution program. We \nhave already directed a request for information on the proposed program to Bennet Moskowitz, and look \nforward to his response and to a productive dialogue with counsel ahead of the Jan. 10, 2019 deadline set by \nthe Magistrate for an update on the status of our negotiations. Assuming that our settlement discussions with \nDefendants progress, we look forward to working with you at the appropriate time to design an effective and \nappropriate settlement program. \nRoberta (\"Robbie\") Kaplan, Esq. \nKaplan Hecker 82 Fink L.I.P \n35o Fifth Avenue \nI \nSuite 71 io \nNew York. New York io118 \nFrom: Jordy Feldman \nSent: Monday, November 25, 2019 4:00 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein Victims' Compensation Program \nRoberta, \nAs you know, I will be serving as co-Designer, along with Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros, and Administrator of \nthe proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. I wanted to reach out to you to introduce myself, as I \nunderstand that you represent victims who have asserted, or may assert, claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey \nEpstein or his Estate. I also wanted to reinforce the key guiding principles of the Program and give you a sense \nof timing in the near term. \nThis proposed Program is purely voluntary, non-adversarial and entirely independent of the Estate. The Estate \nwill have no authority whatsoever to interfere with the administration of the Program or the evaluation of \nindividual claims. \nEFTA00027914\n\nKen, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a proposed protocol - setting forth the proposed terms, \nconditions, and criteria that will govern the Program - and plan to circulate a draft protocol before the end of \nthe year. We will be seeking your input at that time in whatever format you would like to provide it, through a \nmeeting with us and/or written comments, before the protocol is finalized. \nWe look forward to serving these deserving victims. \nRegards, \nJordy \nThis email and its attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or protected from disclosure by the attorney-client work product or other \napplicable legal privilege.
