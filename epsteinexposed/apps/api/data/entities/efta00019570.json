And Alex, if you have the transcript from the prior proceeding before Judge Freeman, I'd be grateful if \nyou could send it, though no rush at all on that — anytime early next week would be totally fine. \nFrom: Kate L.

Freeman \nAlex: can you pls check the transcript? I know they have also said it to me directly and he certainly didn't disagree with \nme when I said it before J  Failla. \nAlso: we got the Feinberg draft protocol today; its exactly as much of a disaster as we expected. \nKate: psl send to along with their recent VI filings. \nRoberta (\"Robbie\") Kaplan, Esq. \nKaplan Hecker & Fink LLP \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, December 13, 2019 1:09 PM \nTo: Alex Conlon Roberta Kaplan \nSubject: RE: Transcript from yesterday's conference \nThis is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even \nwere punitive damages to be excluded, a claim \"for millions upon millions of dollars.\" \nSeparately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: \"They [the estate and/or the \ntrustees?] have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother.\" I'm wondering if you might have a recollection of \nwhat the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was \nin connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that \ninformation, of course—no obligation at all. And if it's more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an \nemail, please don't hesitate to give a call. No emergency or rush, but did want to ask. \nthanks, \nFrom: Alex Conlon \nSent: Thursday, December 12, 2019 18:34 \nTo: \nCc: Roberta Kaplan \nSubject: Transcript from yesterday's conference \nHi there, \nAttached is the transcript from yesterday's conference that Robbie described in the call today. \nTake care, \nAlex \nAlex Conlon I  Kaplan Recker & Fink LIP \nEFTA00019571\n\nThis email and its attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or protected from disclosure by the attorney-client. work product or other \napplicable legal privilege.
