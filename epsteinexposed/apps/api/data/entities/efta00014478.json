Here's their passport explanation, from the defense filing: \nEighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years \nago. And the government offers nothing to suggest —  and certainly no \nevidence —\nthat Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein — an affluent member of the Jewish \nfaith — acquired the passport in the 1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in \nconnection to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal protection in the \nevent of \ntravel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, \nhijackers or terrorists should \nviolent episodes occur. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00014478",
