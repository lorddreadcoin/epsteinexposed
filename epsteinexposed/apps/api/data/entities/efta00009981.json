I'll call BM chambers and set a time for me to bring over the thumb \ndrive containing the supplemental 3500 production (with the correct 3521-003 and 3521-004 included).

Maxwell - missing testifying witness materials \nUSANYS) [Contractor) \nThanks so much for flagging, I just re-stamped the materials as 3521-003 and 3521-004, saved here. I've loaded the \ntwo files to the thumb drive for that contains the supplemental 3500 production and swapped out the incorrect \nversions. If that sounds good to go, I can bring it over to chambers later this morning. \nSince I'm joining this production a bit late, do these two re-stamped files need to be sent out anywhere else? Thanks! \nFrom: (USANYS) \n> \nSent: Saturday, November 6, 2021 5:59 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n<J >; \nUSANYS) [Contractor) \nCc: \nSubject: FW: US v. Maxwell - missing testifying witness materials \nThe index listed this correctly as 3521-003 and 3521-004, but we produced as 3521-004 and 3521-005 (I think). When you \nhave a chance, can you please confirm? If so, I think let's reproduce as 3521-003 an 3521-004, but let me know if you \nthink that will be more confusing/make more work. \nThanks, \nFrom: Laura Menninger \nSent: Saturday, November 6, 2021 5:53 PM \nTo: \n< \n>; \n(USANYS) \n< \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca \nSubject: [EXTERNAL] US v.
