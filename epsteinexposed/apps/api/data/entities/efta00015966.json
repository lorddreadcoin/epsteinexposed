He is currently in prison but has cooperated on other cases with ATF and \nnow wants to cooperate with authorities on the Maxwell case. I  believe he is credible. \nHe named many names to me which we didn't publish but he is happy to share with investigators. \nhttps://www.thesun.co.ukinews/12091701/epstein-maxwell-people-sex-under-age-girls/\nHe has asked me to reach out to help facilitate this. \nCan you help? Or advise on how I should proceed? \nThanks \nEmma \nEmma Parry \nDigital US Correspondent, The Sun \nwww.the-sun.com \n\"Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\" \nThis e-mail and any attachments are confidential, may be \nlegally privileged and are the property of News Corp UK & Ireland \nLimited on whose systems they were generated.
