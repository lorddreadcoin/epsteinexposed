For some reason USPV00341820-26 were \nblank. I tried clicking image and extracted text and those didn't help. Also, for the documents USVP00341831-51, skipping \nsome here and there, they said \"Browser does not support this multimedia format\". I marked all of these \"For further \nreview\", is this how you want them marked or do you want me to change that to something else? \nThank you, \nEFTA00025192",
