He attended \nVictoria's Secret fashion shows; some of the models were guests on his private island, according to a former Epstein employee. \nEpstein courted young women through the Miami modeling agency MC2, putting them up in an apartment he owned on 66th Street in \nManhattan, a former agency bookkeeper said in a 2010 deposition in a civil case. L Brands has employed models from MC2 over the years. \nA spokeswoman for L Brands declined to comment on whether any were tied to Epstein. \nModels were an Epstein theme,  \naccording  to William Mook, head of Mok Industries in Columbus. \nan investment opportunity in September 2005 to Ed Razek, an L Brands executive who helps select Victoria's Secret models. Epstein invited \nthe two men to the Manhattan mansion and when he and Razek showed up, Mook said, they were welcomed by young women who \nsaid they were working as models for Epstein. An L Brands spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for an interview with Razek. Much \nlike the mansion, the Boeing 727, on which Epstein shuttled famous friends including Bill Clinton, was also a hand-me-down from Wexner, \nrecords show. Epstein had the tags changed to a vanity plate ending in \"JE,\" according to documents obtained by JetTrack. \nEpstein used the jet on at least one occasion in the 1990s to travel to Abigail Plantation in Georgia, a quail-hunting preserve Wexner named \nfor his wife, according to a person familiar with the itinerary. The two men went hunting and Epstein came back empty-handed, the person \nsaid. \nIn Epstein's infamous \"Little Black Book\" of contacts, first published by the now-defunct website Gawker in 2015, there are hundreds of \nnames. Dozens of phone numbers are listed for Wexner -- for his home, the plantation, residences in London and Aspen as well as for \nvarious vehicles and staff associated with each property, plus more for executives at Wexner's companies. \nThese former ties could be liabilities for Wexner, who in a 2003 Vanity Fair article praised Epstein for his \"combination of excellent \njudgment and unusually high standards.\" What's more, Wexner said, \"he is always a most loyal friend.\" \nHe said he met Epstein after pitching \nThis is the email I have sent you before which references the highlighted statement above. \nIfubpoenas last time I researched this ...
