United States \nI \nDear Roy and Jay: \nI am attaching the United States' Response to the Petitioners' Motion to Unseal the Non-Prosecution Agreement, \nwhich was filed in the victims' rights suit filed against the United States by Attorney Brad Edwards on behalf of \ntwo of the victims. In his motion to unseal, Attorney Edwards stated that he would provide notice of his motion \nto counsel for Mr. Epstein. I do not know if he actually did so. \nIn our response, we oppose the Petitioners' motion, and point out that Mr. Edwards has filed a civil suit against \nMr. Epstein and that litigation regarding the Non-Prosecution Agreement is more appropriate in that forum \nwhere the real party in interest (Mr. Epstein) is a party to the suit. \n<<DE29_081008_Resp to Motn Unseal.pdt>> \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nFax \n*WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW**WWW \nThe information contained in \nthis communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client \nprivileged, may \nconstitute inside information, \nand is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
