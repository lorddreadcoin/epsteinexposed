I'm also \nattaching the Excel sheet, containing defense and government objections, that contains all four lists in four different \nsheets. This Excel sheet is also saved on the shared in the jury selection folder. \nIf anything needs to be edited, I'll be around for a bit longer today but I'm unavailable later this afternoon/evening, after \n3:30pm today. Cooper have kindly offered to handle any edits tonight when I'm offline, \nso I can loop them in if necessary. \nThanks so much! \nFro \nSubject: joint letter \nHi=, \nThanks so much for all you're doing today, really appreciate it. Attached is a draft of the joint letter for today with the four \ncategories. Could you please fill those in after you've had a chance to enter all the data from the defense? I'm fine with \ncharts in each of the four questions (essentially just one row of cells with juror numbers). Also fine with bullet points. \nWhichever is easiest. \nWhenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know —  we'll need to \nsend this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00021979",
