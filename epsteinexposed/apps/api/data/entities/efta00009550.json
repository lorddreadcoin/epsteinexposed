I'm sorry, I \ntake that back. \nShe was told to \nsay \nthat she \nwas 18, and she told us \nthat she had a fake \nI.D. \nshowing \nthat she was 18. \nSo \nshe passed that \ninformation \nalong to the \nother girls when \nshe brought -- \neventually she \nbrought \nother girls to \nperform massages, and \nthat was one of \nthe \nthings \nthat she told -- \nshe told us first \nthat she brought \n18- to 20-year \nold girls.

I mean, we talked \n23 \nabout the preferences that Jeffrey discussed, as far as \n24 \nwhich \ngirls he would like \nto bring. \n25 \nOnce started giving massages to Epstein, \nEFTA00009559\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPage 11 \ntold us that \nhe liked different faces, so he \nwould \nask her to bring other girls.

I guess we asked if she \never made a mistake, or \never brought somebody that Mr. \nEpstein didn't take to. She said that she had screwed up \nand that she had \nbrought a black girl to Mr. Epstein, \nand \nthat \nEpstein was not \ninterested in black girls. But \nhe \ndid pay her, \nand said that he wasn't a \nracist. He paid \nher \nthe $200 for her time, \nbut did not want her to \nperform \na \nmassage for him. \nQ And he didn't allow that girl \nto perform a \nmassage? \nA \nNo. \nWas there \nanything else \nthat Miss talked \nabout in the interview \nthat you want to share with \nthe \ngrand \njury? \nA \nI \ndid ask her at the \nend of the interview if \nshe \nwas in love with Mr. \nEpstein. She \nlooked into the \ncamera \nand said that \nshe loved him like a \nfriend. But then \nshe \nCopyl \nof13 \nEFTA00009560\n\nPage \n12 \n1 \nkind of looked \ninto the camera and gave \na wink and a smile \n2 \nand \nsaid, \"But with your \nmoney, I'd marry \nyou any time, \n3 \nJeffrey.\" \n4 \nQ Did she \nalso say that she considered him \nto be \n5 \nan •awesome guy'? \n6 \nA Several times she \nreferred to him as an \n\"awesome \n7 \nguy° •  She said that the girls \nbegged her to come and that \n8 \nthe girls didn't have \na complaint, and the girls would \n9 \nshare with her everything that happened \nafter the massage, \n10 \n11 \n12 \nand that Jeffrey never \ntouched any of the girls. But as \nI \ninformed you, we did \ninterview some of the girls that she \ntook, \nand he has touched them. \n13 \nQ In preparation for your testimony today, did you \n14 \nalso speak with \nsomeone who is considered to be an expert \n15 \nin these \ncases? \n16 \nA \nYeS. \n17 \nQ And what is that person's name? \n18 \nA \n19 \nQ \nHas Mr. been qualified to testify as an \n20 \nexpert in federal and \nstate courts in cases that involve \n21 \nwhat he calls \"compliant \nvictims\"? \n22 \nA Yes. \n23 \nQ \nwhat \ndoes he mean by the term \n\"compliant \n24 \nvictims\"? \n25 \nA A compliant victim is when a victim is not \nEFTA00009561\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPage \n13 \nnecessarily \nforced \ninto \nthe \nconduct \nthat \nthe \noffender \nwants \nthem \nto \nengage \ninto, \nthat \nthey \nactually \nconsent \nto \nthat \nkind \nof \nactivity. \nQ \nSo \nthat \nwould \ninclude \nminors \nwho \nare \nsubjected \nto \nsexual \nactivity \nbut \nweren't \nnecessarily \nkidnapped \nor \nforced \nat \ngunpoint, \nor \nsomething \nlike \nthat? \nA \nExactly. \nQ \nDid \nhe \ndiscuss \nwith \nyou \nthe \ndifficulties \nthat \nexist \nwhen \nyou \ninterview \nthose \ntypes \nof \nvictims? \nA \nYes. \nHe \nstated \nthat \na \ncompliant \nvictim \nis \noften \ntimes \nembarrassed \nthat \nthey \nwent \nalong \nwith \nthe \nbehavior. \nThey \nare \nalso \nlikely \nto \ndeny \nthe \nbehavior, \nespecially \nwhen \nbeing \ninterviewed \nby \ninvestigators, \nthat \nthey'll \ndeny \nit \nor \nthey'll \nminimize \nit. \nSometimes \nit \ntakes \ntwo, \nthree \nor \nmultiple \ninterviews \nto \nget \ncompliant \nvictims \nto \neither \ntrust \ntheir \ninterviewer \nor \nrealize \nthat \ntheir \ninterviewer \nis \nnot \ngoing \nto \nbe \njudgemental. \nQ \nIn \nthis \ncase, \nhave \nyou \nfound \nthat \nto \nbe \nthe \ncase \nwith \nsome \nof \nthe \ninterviews? \nA \nYes, \nI \nhave. \nQ \nIn \naddition \nto \nbeing \nembarrassed, \nsometimes \nthese \nvictims \nfeel \nguilty \nabout \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthey \nwere \ninvolved \nin \nthis \ntype \nof \nactivity? \nA \nOh, \nyes. \nQ \nDoes \nMr. \nalso \nhave \nexpertise \nin \nsexual \nCopy \n1 \nof \n13 \nEFTA00009562\n\nPage \n14 \n1 \npreference of \noffenders? \n2 \nA \nYes, he \ndoes. \n3 \nQ Did he explain why \nan offender would select the \n4 \ntypes \nof \nvictims \nthat are involved \nin this \ncase, \ngirls \n5 between 14 and \n17-years-old? \n6 \nA This type of \noffender, the sexual preference \nhe \n7 \nhas \nis for post-pubescent females that \nare physically \n8 developed but \nnot necessarily mentally matured. \nThe girls \n9 ranging \nin this age are sometimes \ninexperienced, they are \n10 \npossibly naive, not as worldly. \n11 \nAn offender of \nthis type could also maybe not \n12 feel \nsexually adequate or feel competent \ndealing with his \n13 \nown \nage group. So knowing that \nthese \ngirls are \nless \n14 \nexperienced, may \nfocus on them as well. \n15 \nQ \nIn addition \nto their emotional \nimmaturity, did \n16 \nMr. \ntalk \nabout whether or not younger girls \nare \n17 \neasier to manipulate than grown women? \n18 \nA \nYes. \n19 \nQ \nDid he \ntalk to you about \n\"grooming\"? \n20 \nA \nYeah. \nThat's \nwhat an \noffender \nwill \nuse \nwith a \n21 compliant victim. \nHe told us that grooming is a \ntechnique \n22 \nwhere you \ngain the \ncooperation of \nthose victims by \n23 \nfocusing on their interests and playing up to those \nlled it. That \n24 interests. It's a type of seduction, he ca \n25 was his words for it. And we actually see \nthis \nin this \nI \nEFTA00009563\n\nPage 15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncase. \nCan you give us an example of some of the types \nof grooming that Mr. Epstein used? \nA With one \nof the girls we're going to \ntalk about \ntoday, , it's very apparent \ninterviewing her how \nEpstein \ngroomed her. She only went to three or four \nmassages at this time, \nthat she's admitted to. We \nfeel \nthat due to her phone \nconversations, the multiple calls, \nthat there may be more \nthere. At this point she has \nstated to us that she has \nperformed three or four \nmassages \nfor Mr. Epstein. \nwhat he \ndid is when she \nfirst went \nthere he \nplayed \nupon -- she was \nvery shy, and \nhe would play \nupon \nthat \nshyness. He \ntold her that she \nwas pretty. \nHe asked \nher \nto remove \nher \nclothing, and she \nwould not. \nSo he kind \nof kidded \naround with \nher shyness and \ncomplimented \nher, \nshowed \ninterest in \nher, talked \nabout her \nboyfriend and \ndifferent \ninterests she had. \nAt \nthe end of \nthat \ninterview, because \nshe did \nnot take \noff her clothes, \nhe tells her \nthat if she's \nwilling to do \nmore, she will \nmake more. \nHe also \ntells her \nthat \nhe would \npay her if she \nwould bring \nother \ngirls. As \nthe \nmassages \nincreased, you \ncan see \nthat the next \ntime she \ncomes he \nplays \nagain to that \nshyness, \nbut he gets a \nlittle \nbit more -- I guess \nhe sees that it's \nnot working. \nThis \nCopy 1 of \n13 \nEFTA00009564\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPage 16 \ntime she does \ncomply and takes off her \n-- he asked her to \ndisrobe on the \nsecond massage. She \ntakes off her blouse, \nbut she refuses to take \noff the bra after Mr. Epstein \nasked \nher to. \nSo \nyou can see that he tries through \nshowing \ninterest. \nAnd then he actually -- when he sees that this \nisn't \nworking, he takes a more \nauthoritative role with \nher \nin the last massage. She said that throughout all of \nthese massages \nhe was very \nnice, and \nthen at \nthe end he \nwas much more frustrated and irritated. She does get down \nto her \nbra and panties on that one, he's just much \nmore authoritative. \nSo he started \nwith the grooming process, \ntried \nto get her interest, tried to use that to get her to \ncomply with removing her \nclothes. \nBut \nas often \nhappens, \nat the end of this, he took over and was much more \nforceful with his requests. \nQ Have other girls described that same situation \nwhere every time they went back, he tried to push it one \nstep further and one step further? \nA \nYes. Several \nof the girls have said that he \nwould always push for more and more. \nQ Did Mr. explain why \nit is that a \ncompliant child victim cannot legally consent to the \nsexual \nconduct? \nEFTA00009565\n\nPage \n17 \n1 \nA Yeah. He stated that -- you know, we \ntalked \n2 \nabout how the law protects children, \nand stated that we \n3 hold adults \naccountable.
