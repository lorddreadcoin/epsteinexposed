Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential \nmaterials, scenes \nDate: Tue, 16 Mar 2021 22:40:19 +0000 \nAttachments: 2021.03.16_Maxwell_Discovery_Letter.pdfi \nSDNYGM0274310 1 JCONFIDENTIAL].xlsx; \nSDNY_GM_02743102_[CONFIDENTIAL].xlsx \nInline-Images: image001.jpg \nAll, \nAttached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding \ndiscovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. \nIn response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: \nRegarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: \n•  There are three categories of these images: \no  Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not \nbeen previously provided to you) \no  Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have \npreviously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) \no  Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of \nEpstein (which have not been previously provided to you) \n•  The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, \nand the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. \no  All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must \nbe viewed using Cellebrite. \no  The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple \ndevices. \no  The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each \nimage. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all \nother images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. \no  The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder \nto indicate which device each image was seized from. \n•  Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and \nthere is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able \nto provide a  single laptop for review of these images. \nRegarding the physical evidence: \n•  Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items \nassociated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the \nFBI New York office's current investigation. \n•  The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two \nitems (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 \nEFTA00030101\n\nFederal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that \nyou will have all evidence in one place. \n•  The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the \nfollowing conditions: \no  The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and \nplace them in a location where a large group of people can view them. \no  The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. \no  At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. \no  The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. \nTo ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend \nto be physically present for this review. \no  Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team \nmay bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If \nthe defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who \nare present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the \npresence of nudity. \no  Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. \n•  To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, \nthe FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large \nitems, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed \nHighly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if \nnecessary. \n•  The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a \nsingle location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media \nthat does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI \nanticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in \ndowntown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. \no  To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's \nresidences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For \nyour awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on \nall of those discs. \nPlease let me know how you wish to proceed. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nSt. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, March 15, 2021 6:00 PM \nTo: 'Laura Menninger' <Imenninger@hmflaw.com>; \n(USANYS) \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliuca@hmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengressercom) \n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>; 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com> \nSubject: RE: US v.

If I had an idea of \nwhen you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. \nAt a  minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the \nattorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their \nevidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory \nbefore we start reviewing evidence. \nAlso, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? \nThanks, \nLaura \nLaura A.

Please let me know if you would like to wait \nuntil all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review \nthe highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those \nhighly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all \nof your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the \nevidence vault that same week. \nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed.

That spreadsheet does \nnot include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 \ndiscovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office \nduring the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range \nSDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. \nAs a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the \nphysical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00030104\n\n1 St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Laura Menninger <Imenninger@hmflaw.com>\nSent: Tuesday, March 9, 2021 3:44 PM \nTo: \n) < \n>; \n) \n(USANYS)\nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliucaahmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>• 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com>\nSubject: RE: US v.
