Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys filed a third bail application earlier today. As part of that application, they \nproposed that she will renounce her French and British citizenship, claiming that such a renunciation obviates the Court's \nconcerns about the validity of waivers of extradition. I have attached their application here. We have not yet been \nordered to reply, but would be grateful for your thoughts when you have a chance. \nThanks very much, \nM \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nTel: \nEFTA00021355",
