EPSTEIN, \n) \n) \nPROBATE NO. ST-19-PB-80 \no \ne\n-• \n) \n4--  \n7-.\n.73 \nDeceased. \n) \nACTION FOR TESTATE \n) \nADMINISTRATION \nrs,\nEXPEDITED \nMOTION \nFOR ESTABLISHMENT OF \nA VOLUNTARY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROGRAM \nCOME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the \"Estate\"), \nDARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, and move this \nHonorable Court for an \nexpedited order to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program (the \n\"Program\") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein, deceased, as \nmore fully described infra. As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the Program would provide all \neligible claimants an opportunity to receive \ncompensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of \nsexual abuse against \nMr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. \nTo be designed and implemented by independent, nationally recognized \nclaims administration \nexperts, \nwith input \nfrom interested parties including \nclaimants and their representatives, the \nProgram would seek to timely resolve these claims through a  process that is \nsensitive to the \nexperiences and concerns of \nclaimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nAs widely reported in the news media, multiple individuals have asserted or expressed their \nintent to assert claims of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (collectively, the \"Sexual Abuse Claims\"). \nTo date, twelve lawsuits involving Sexual Abuse Claims have been filed in the state and federal \ncourts of the State of New York, where claimants assert some of the complained-of conduct \noccurred, and which recently amended its statute of limitations to \npermit such claims. These \nEFTA00018905\n\nEstate of Jeffrey Epstein Probate No. \nST.19-PB-80 \nMotion for Establishment of Compensation Program \nPage 2 \nlawsuits name as defendants the Estate, the Co-Executors, and various entities \nowned or controlled \nby Mr. Epstein prior to his death, as well as purported agents and employees of Mr. Epstein or \nthose entities. \nPursuant to this Court's order, Notice to Creditors was duly first published on \nSeptember 18, 2019. However, only one Sexual Abuse Claim has so far been filed in the Virgin \nIslands. As noted above, claimants have named the Estate and others in various lawsuits in \njurisdictions outside the Virgin Islands and, based on media reports and statements by various \ncounsel for plaintiffs, the Co-Executors anticipate that more Sexual Abuse Claims may be filed in \nvarious jurisdictions including New York, Florida, New Mexico and France. \nPurpose of the \nMotion \n• The Co-Executors believe that \nthe \ninterests of justice require the \nEstate to fairly \naddress and timely resolve the Sexual Abuse Claims, no matter where filed, as \na matter of national and international importance. As much of the value to \nclaimants lies in the fair and timely resolution of their claims, the Co-Executors \nrequest that this Court grant the instant Motion expeditiously. \n• Guided by independent, nationally recognized claims \nadministration experts, \nthe Co-Executors have worked \ndiligently to begin formulating a comprehensive \nprocess for determination and resolution of the \nSexual Abuse Claims. If \napproved by the Court, the \nProgram would provide, to the fullest extent \npossible, \nvictims of sexual abuse access to a  confidential claims resolution \nprocess \nthat does not entail the rigors and publicity of \nlitigation. To our \nknowledge, this Court is the first probate court that \nhas been called upon to \napprove the establishment of a mass \ntort-type program for achieving the fair, \nEFTA00018906\n\nEstate offebey Epstein \nProbate No. \nST-19-PB-80 \nMotion for \nEstablishment of Compensation Program \nPage 3 \nindependent determination and \nresolutions of sexual abuse \nclaims filed by \nmultiple claimants \nagainst a decedent's estate. As \na matter of public policy \nalone, the \nurgency of this matter cannot \nbe overstated. \nDevelopment of the Program \nfor evaluation and \nresolution of the Sexual \nAbuse Claims, in \na \nmanner designed to evaluate \nthose claims in a  confidential \nmanner and to streamline \ntheir \ndetermination by the \ncountry's most experienced claims \nadministrators — individuals who have \ndesigned, implemented and \nadministered extensive mass tort \nprograms including the \nSeptember \n1 I th \nVictim Compensation \nFund, the Roman Catholic \nChurch sex-abuse scandal, \nthe BP \nDeepwater Horizon oil spill in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, the Agent \nOrange toxic chemical matter, \nand \nothers — would be in the \nbest interests of claimants, \nthe Estate, its creditors and \nits beneficiaries. \nAccordingly, in order \nto create a mechanism for the \njust and efficient resolution of \nthe Sexual \nAbuse Claims that will attract \nthe voluntary participation of \nclaimants, the Co-Executors \nrequest \nthe Court's authorization to use the \nEstate's funds to retain the services \nof the claims administration \nexperts described \nbelow, so that they may properly \nproceed with preparation of the Program \nand \ndesign of \nan appropriate protocol to establish a \nfair, independent claims resolution \nprocess. \nII. \nPROPOSED EPSTEIN VICTIMS' \nCOMPENSATION PROGRAM \nAs \ncontemplated by the Co-Executors, the proposed Epstein \nVictims' Compensation \nProgram would ultimately \nfunction as follows: \nParticipation in the \nProgram by claimants would be entirely \nvoluntary, and would not affect \nany rights a  claimant has, unless and until the \nclaimant accepts the Program's compensation \ndetermination and executes a release. \nAll claimants would be afforded an opportunity to meet \nwith the Program Administrator (described below) if they so desire, \nand will be treated with \ncompassion, dignity and \nrespect. The planned situs of the Program would be in New York, where \nEFTA00018907\n\nEstate of JeJj5-ey Epstein Probate No. ST- \nI9-PB-80 \nMotion for Establishment of Compensation Program Page 4 \nthe majority of the Sexual Abuse Claims thus far have been fi\nled, in order to alleviate the burden \nof requiring claimants to travel to the Virgin Islands. Proceeding in that forum would also provide \nclaimants and their counsel with easier \naccess to the Program Administrator, who is highly \nqualified and experienced with this type of claims process, and is therefore likely to reduce the \noverall costs of Program administration. The Program would be open to claimants wherever they \nare located, and would use an electronic filing system to make the process available regardless of \nthe claimant's location. \nA. PROPOSED MECHANICS AND \nADMINISTRATION OF THE \nPROGRAM \nIf this Court authorizes the Co-Executors to proceed with development of the proposed \nProgram, a detailed Program \nprotocol (the \"Protocol\") would be designed by the claims \nadministration experts, with input from the Co-Executors and those with an interest in resolution \nof the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their representatives), and submitted to the \nCourt for its \napproval. \nA ten-point \nsummary of the \ncontemplated Program follows: \n1. Participation in the Program would be \nentirely voluntary. \n2. The Program would be available to all claimants with sexual \nabuse claims \nagainst Mr. Epstein who satisfy certain eligibility criteria, as defined in the \nProtocol. \n3. While strict confidentiality will be required of the Program Administrator \nand the Estate, each claimant would be free to disclose any and all \ninformation concerning her participation in the Program, at claimant's sole \ndiscretion, including information concerning the mechanics of the Program \nand the resolution of her claim. \n4. Claimants who elect to file a claim with the Program would be invited to \nprovide documentation identified in a claim form to be developed by the \nclaims administration experts, and any additional corroborating or \nsupporting information to help substantiate their claim. \nEFTA00018908\n\nEstate of Jeffrey Epstein Probate No. ST- 9-PB-80 \nMotion for \nEstablishment of Compensation Program Page 5 \n5. All claimants would be afforded a  voluntary, confidential \nopportunity to \nmeet with the Program Administrator to \nprovide additional information that \nmay bear upon evaluation of their claims. \n6. Claims would be processed promptly and efficiently. Claimants would be \nnotified of any deficiency that prevents processing of their claim and \nprovided an opportunity to cure that deficiency. \n7. Once a  completed claim has been submitted, the Program Administrator \nwould evaluate that claim based on all available information and would \ndetermine whether the \nclaimant is eligible to receive compensation and the \namount of compensation to be paid. This independent, individual \ndetermination will be based on factors and criteria identified in the Protocol. \nThe \nEstate will have no authority to reject or modify the independent \ndetermination of the Program Administrator. \n8. \nUpon issuance of a compensation \ndetermination by the Program \nAdministrator, the claimant would have complete freedom to accept or \nreject that determination. If the claimant elects to accept the determination, \nthe claimant would execute a release waiving her right to litigate any claims \nshe may have against any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. \nEpstein's conduct, as set forth in the Protocol. Upon the Program \nAdministrator's receipt of \nthe claimant's acceptance of the compensation \ndetermination and an executed \nrelease, the Program Administrator would \napprove payment. The approval of any claim by the Program Administrator \nwill be deemed to have the effect of a  claim \"examined and approved\" \nwithin the meaning of 15 V.I.C. § 394, and, as already indicated, the Co-\nExecutors \nwould have no authority to reject or \nmodify the \nProgram \nAdministrator's determination of any \ncompensatory award made in \naccordance with the \nProtocol. \n9. The Program Administrator will submit status reports to the Court on a \nquarterly basis to provide updated information regarding the progress of the \nProgram, including the number of claims received, the number of claims \nreviewed, the number of claims approved for payment, the aggregate \nvalue \nof determinations issued, the aggregate \nvalue of determinations accepted, \nand the aggregate value of determinations issued. \n10. Following \nconclusion of the Program, the Program Administrator would \nissue a  Final \nReport to the Court and the Co-Executors summarizing the \nProgram. \nEFTA00018909\n\nEstate ofieffrry Epstein \nProbate No. ST\n-19-P840 \nMotion for Establishment \nof Compensation Program \nPage 6 \nB. \nPROPOSED CLAIMS PROCESS FOR PROGRAM \nPARTICIPATION \nWith respect to the timing and notice of \nclaims, the Program would, if approved \nby the \nCourt, establish an effective commencement \ndate and deadline for submission of all claims. A \nclaim form would be developed by the \nProgram Administrator and disseminated to all known \nclaimants identified in a confidential database. Instructions for completing the form \nwould be \nincluded along with the form. The Program would operate and maintain a website that \nprovides \ngeneral information about the Program, including the \nProtocol, Frequently Asked Questions, and \ninformation about filing deadlines. Contact information for the Program \nwould also be available \non the Program website. That website would also allow \nclaimants, directly or through their \nrepresentatives, to register a new claim and/or upload their \nclaim form or supporting documents to \nfacilitate submission \nand processing \nof \nindividual claims. \nC. PROPOSED DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION \nOF THE PROGRAM \nTo establish the Program and design and implement the Protocol, the Co-Executors \npropose engaging the services of independent, nationally recognized experts in this field: \nJordana H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros, whose credentials are discussed \nin Section D below. The Protocol developed by these experts, with input from the Co-Executors \nand those with an interest in resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their \nrepresentatives), would include eligibility criteria, the methodology for determining compensatory \ndamages, proof \nrequirements and claims procedures, and timing, as follows: \n• Eligibility. Identifying the criteria to \ndetermine whether a claimant is eligible to \nreceive \ncompensation under the Program. \n• Determination Methodology. Defining the factors and considerations to be used to \ndetermine the \namount of compensation to be offered to any eligible claimant. \nEFTA00018910\n\nEstate offeffrey \nEpstein Probate No. \nST-19-PB-80 \nMotion \nfor Establishment of Compensation \nProgram \nPage 7 \n• Proof \nRequirements and Claims Procedures. Determining what types of \nsupporting documentation \nor other evidence each individual may be required to \nsubmit to substantiate the claim, \nsatisfy Protocol requirements, and allow the \nProgram Administrator to review, process and \nevaluate the claim. \n• Timing. Expressly stating the \ntimeframe of the Program, including an effective \ncommencement date and \ndeadline for submission of all claims. \nIn addition to leading the design and \nimplementation of the Program, Ms. Feldman would \nserve as the \nProgram Administrator and would administer the Program and process \nall claims. The \nProgram Administrator would have final decision-making \nauthority relating to the administration, \nevaluation and valuation of claims. As noted \nabove, the approval of any claim by the Program \nAdministrator will be deemed to have the \neffect of a claim \"examined and approved\" within the \nmeaning of 15 V.I.C. § \n394. \nD. CREDENTIALS OF \nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND DESIGNERS \nThe Program Administrator and \nProgram Designers' qualifications for participation in the \nProgram are set forth below. \n1. Jordana H. Feldman (Program Administrator & Designer) \n• \nMs. Feldman has spent her career engaged in the design, \nimplementation and administration of mass tort claims programs \nand complex settlements as effective and creative alternatives to \nlitigation. \n• Until recently, Ms. Feldman served as the Deputy Special \nMaster and Director of the New \nYork Office of the September \n1 1 th Victim Compensation Fund (\"VCF\"), the litigation-\nalternative program established in 2001 and reopened in 2011 to \ncompensate individuals who have become sick or died as a result \nof their September 11th-related exposure, and administered by \nthe United States Department of Justice.

Before working at Dickstein \nShapiro, LLP, Feldman worked as a litigation associate at Fried, \nFrank, Harris, Shriver \n& Jacobson. \n• Ms. Feldman is the \nco-author of the Master Guide to Mass \nClaims Resolution Facilities (2011) and graduated in 2000 from \nthe \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School. She received her \nundergraduate degree magna cum laude in 1997 from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. \n2. Kenneth \nR. Feinberg (Program Designer) \n• Mr. Feinberg is the nation's leading expert in mediation and \nalternative \ndispute \nresolution, and the founder of \nthe Law \nOffices of Kenneth R. Feinberg, PC. He has been appointed to \nadminister numerous high-profile compensation programs, \nhaving served as special master of the September 1 I th Victim \nCompensation Fund, the Troubled Asset Relief Program \n(\"TARP') Executive Compensation Program, and the Agent \nOrange Victim Compensation \nProgram. \n• Mr. Feinberg and his colleague Camille Biros \nhave designed and \nimplemented the New York Archdiocese Independent \nReconciliation \nand Compensation \nProgram for \nresolution \nof \nclaims of sexual abuse of minors by members of the clergy, as \nwell as similar compensation funds for the Dioceses of Brooklyn \nand Rockville Centre, New York and for Dioceses in the states \nof California, \nColorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \n• \nMr. Feinberg has served as adjunct professor of law at Harvard \nLaw School, Columbia Law School, University of Pennsylvania \nSchool of \nLaw, \nGeorgetown University Law \nCenter, New \nYork \nUniversity School of \nLaw, University of Virginia \nSchool of \nLaw, and \nBenjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Before his \nacademic career, he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York, special counsel for the U.S. \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary, \nand founding partner of the \nWashington office of the law firm Kaye Scholer LLP, among \nother \npositions. \nEFTA00018912\n\nEstate of-Jeffrey Epstein \nProbate No. ST \n-19-PB-80 \nMotion \nfor Establishment of \nCompensation Program \nPage 9 \n• Mr. \nFeinberg graduated from New \nYork University School \nof \nLaw in \n1970 and received his \nundergraduate degree \nin 1967 \nfrom the \nUniversity of Massachusetts. \n3. \nCamille S. Biros (Program \nDesigner) \n• Ms. \nBiros is a nationally recognized expert in \nthe design, \nimplementation and \nadministration of \npublic and private \ncompensation programs. \nShe currently serves as \nDirector, \nClaims Administration, \nat the Law Offices of \nKenneth R. \nFeinberg, P.C. \n• Ms. \nBiros and Mr. Feinberg have \ndesigned and implemented \nthe \nNew \nYork Archdiocese \nIndependent \nReconciliation and \nCompensation Program for \nresolution of claims of \nsexual abuse \nof minors by members \nof the clergy, as \nwell as similar \ncompensation \nfunds for the Dioceses of \nBrooklyn and Rockville \nCentre, New York \nand for Dioceses in the \nstates of California, \nColorado, New Jersey and \nPennsylvania.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF \nIn their fiduciary \ncapacity, the Co-Executors have engaged \nin discussions with relevant \nparties in interest \nregarding the independent, \nfair and timely resolution of \nthe Sexual Abuse \nClaims. It  is their understanding that \nmany existing and potential claimants \nwould prefer to \nparticipate in the \nProgram, if fairly and expeditiously \nadministered, rather than proceeding with \nlitigation. \nFurthermore, although there would be \nsignificant expense in developing and \nadministering the Program, the Co\n-Executors anticipate that the Program would \nsubstantially \nreduce the expenses to the Estate \nof litigating multiple lawsuits in numerous jurisdictions, and \nthus \nwould ultimately reduce expenses \nto the benefit of all parties with an interest \nin the Estate, \nEFTA00018913\n\nEstate \nofJeffrey Epstein \nProbate No. ST- I9-PB-80 \nMotion for Establishment of Compensation Program \nPage 10 \nincluding claimants and \ncreditors.' The expedited nature of the \nplanned Program would also \nensure resolution and \ncompensation to claimants in a \nfar more timely manner than \nthrough \nlitigation. Additionally, the Protocol \nassociated with the Program \nwould be designed to ensure the \nproportionate \nrestitution of approved claims for all claimants, in a \nmanner that would provide \nsimilar compensation to similarly \nsituated claimants. The Co-Executors \nsubmit that such a \nProgram is in \nthe best interests of both the claimants \nand the Estate because, among other \nthings, \nit avoids the potential of \ndisproportionate and inconsistent awards and \nshould help to reduce the \ntime, expense and \nburden of handling claims through the \ncourts, which could involve years of \nlitigation \nand appeals and consume enormous \nresources, along with inflicting costs \nattendant to \ndelay and uncertainty on all \naffected parties. \nRule 1 of the Virgin \nIslands Probate and Fiduciary Rules \nstates that, \"[w]here no procedural \nprovision is \nincluded herein, procedures set forth in the \nVirgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure \nmay be adapted by the court as \nappropriate.\" In this regard, Rule 90 of the Virgin Islands \nRules \nof Civil Procedure evinces a  clear intent in \nfavor of the use of alternative dispute \nresolution to \nresolve \ncivil disputes. Thus, it is respectfully submitted that the \nestablishment here of a voluntary \nclaims resolution program is within the \nCourt's authority and would serve the interests of justice. \nFurthermore, development and \nimplementation of the Program, and the claims \nprocess \ncontemplated therein, is within the Court's \nsound discretion to establish a process by which the \nrights of claimants will be fairly and efficiently ascertained and \nadministered. See 5 V.I.C. § 1264 \nI. Such lawsuits have already begun to generate substantial costs and fees for both the Estate and claimants. The \nexpenses of litigation are expected to ratchet up significantly in coming months, absent \nimplementation of the \nProgram as an alternative path for resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims. \nEFTA00018914\n\nEstate ofleffrey Epstein \nProbate No. ST-I 9-PB.80 \nMotion \nfor Establishment of \nCompensation Program \nPage 11 \n(allowing the \ncourt to declare tights, status and \nother legal relations of various \nclasses of creditors \nor other \ninterested parties of a trust or estate). \nAt this juncture, \nthe Co-Executors seek the \nCourt's authorization to use \nEstate funds to \nretain the services of \nthe \nproposed \nProgram Administrator and \nProgram Designers       Ms. \nFeldman, Mr. \nFeinberg and Ms. Biros — so that they \nmay promptly proceed with \npreparation of \nthe Program and design of the \nProtocol to establish a fair, independent \nclaims resolution process. \nOnce the Protocol is \ndeveloped and finalized, the Co-Executors \nwould submit it to the Court for \napproval and would seek an \norder to formally commence claims \nresolution proceedings under the \nProgram. \nFinally, the Co-Executors \nseek the Court's approval to submit under \nseal the proposed \nengagement agreement of the \nProgram Administrator and Program \nDesigners, as it is proprietary \nto the extent it establishes a \nmethodology and formula for their \ncompensation. Given the very \nsmall group of \npeople sufficiently qualified to design, implement \nand administer the proposed \nProgram and contemplated \nProtocol, the terms under which they are engaged \nwould be subject to \nintense scrutiny and may have the \nunintended effect of distracting from the \nProgram. The Co-\nExecutors will of course \ndisclose the fees for services rendered by the Program \nAdministrator and \nProgram Designers as they are accounted for \nby the Estate. \nEFTA00018915\n\nEstate ofityfrey Epstein \nMotion for Establishment of Compensation \nProgram Page 12 \nProbate No. ST-19-P8-80 \nWHEREFORE, the Co-Executors request the expedited entry of an Order granting the \nrelief requested herein substantially in the form of the attached \nproposed order. \nRespectfully, \nDated: November \n14, 2019 \nCHRISTOPHER ALLEN )(ROBLIN, ESQ. \nANDREW W.
