Please take careful note. \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nSouthern District of New York \nPRESS GUIDANCE \nFriday, November 26, 2021 \n*OFF-THE-RECORD, AND FOR \nGUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be testifying in \nthis trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion (attached) requesting that they \nbe able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, explicit and personal events \nconcerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have been victims. I believe most, if not \nall, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to \nabide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. \n9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v.
