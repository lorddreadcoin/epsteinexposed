If you haven't gotten it from me by \nlater next week, could you please just remind me? I don't want it to get lost in the avalanche of current stuff. \nAlso just to note, we obviously have no position (or request, directive, hint, nod, or wink) whatsoever regarding his \npassport—we don't know what that process is so we completely defer on the substance. But of course happy to get you \nthe order, and let us know if anything else would be helpful. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 11, 2019 10:43 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Epstein Passport \nThe State Department has gotten several inquires regarding Epstein's passport. He currently has one valid \npassport and Consular Affairs (CA) would like to revoke it. \nI understand he will have a bail hearing on Monday. Would you be able to send me the court order (even if he is \nremanded) so CA can revoke to the book? I assume if he is released on bail there will be a travel restriction \nimposed/surrender of his passport. \nThanks. \nASAC \nEFTA00018178\n\nU.S. Department of State \nDiplomatic Security Service \nNew York Field Office \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2019 10:14 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein Passport \n■ \nHappy to be in touch — let us know what info we can provide or how we can be of help. \nthanks, \nFrom \nSent: e  nes ay, u y\nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein Passport \nCc'ed to this email is the prosecution team for the Epstein case. \nTeam, \nPlease \nmeet \nan ASAC at the DSS NY Field Office (and my former boss). \nState Department's Consular Affairs Bureau is looking for some information regarding Epstein's passport, as they \nconsidering revoking it.
