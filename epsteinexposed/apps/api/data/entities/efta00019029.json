We will defer to you on whether these should be redacted. \nBest, \nFrom: Christian Everdell <CEverdell@CohenGresser.com> \nSent: Monday, March 22, 2021 2:29 PM \nSubject: Meet and Confer \nPer Judge Nathan's order, we need to meet and confer today about proposed redactions to Exhibit 11 of your opposition \nand to our letter dated March 9, 2021 regarding redactions.
