    "text": "\n\nU.S. \nDepartment of .1 ustice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of Florida \nVIA UNITED STATES MAIL \n[Name and address of victim's attorney] \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nFacsimile: \n[Date] \nRe: IDefendantl/IVictiml: NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED \nVICTIM \nDear Mr. [Attorney]: \nBy virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District \nof Florida asks that you provide the following notice to your client, [victim], who has been \nidentified as a victim of a federal offense. \nOn June 30, 2008, [defendant] entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes \nSections \n[case information] and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to \nbe followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of \nCommunity Control 1, with conditions of community \nconfinement imposed by the Court. \nIn light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the \nUnited States has agreed to \ndefer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain \nconditions, including the following: \n1. An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an \nattorney representative to represent the victims in connection with civil \nlitigation between the victims and [defendant]. The Special Master \nselected Robert Josefsberg, Esq. \nof the firm Podhurst Orseck, P.A., a \nhighly-respected and experienced attorney. [The victim] is not \nobligated to use Mr. \nJosefsberg as her civil attorney, but, as explained \nin greater detail below, Mr. \nJosefsberg's services will be provided at no \ncost to [the victim] because [defendant] is obligated to pay the costs and \nfees of the \nattorney-representative. Also, [defendant] and his attorneys \nEFTA00014022\n\n[NAME OF VICTIM'S ATTORNEY] \nAMENDED NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIM [NAME] \n[DATE] \nPAGE 2 OF 3 \ncan only contact [the victim] via Mr. Josefsberg, assuming that she \nwould like Mr. \nJosefsberg to serve as her attorney. \n2. If [the victim] elects to file suit against [the defendant] pursuant to Title \n18, United States Code, Section \n2255, [defendant] will not contest the \njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District \nof Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and [defendant] \nwaives his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest \ndamages up to an amount as agreed to between [the victim] and \n[defendant], so \nlong as [the victim] elects to proceed exclusively under \n18 U.S.C. § 2255, \nand she waives any other claim for damages, whether \npursuant to state, federal, or common law. Notwithstanding this \nwaiver, [defendant's] agreement with the United States, his waivers and \nfailure to contest liability and such damages in any suit are not to be \nconstrued as an admission of any criminal or civil liability. \n3. As stated \nabove, [defendant] has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney \nrepresentative selected by the independent third party. This provision, \nhowever, shall not obligate [defendant] to pay \nthe fees and costs of \ncontested litigation filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of \npotential settlements, [the victim] and Mr. Josefsberg \nelect to file a \ncontested lawsuit pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 2255 or she elects to pursue \nany other contested remedy, the \nobligation to pay the costs of the \nattorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations \nto pay reasonable attorneys \nfees and costs such as those contained in \nSection 2255, shall cease. \nMr. Josefsberg will be contacting you within the next two weeks to explain these \nterms and to determine if he may contact [the victim directly. If you would like to contact \nMr. Josefsberg \ndirectly, he can be reached at\nIf [the victim] has selected other counsel to \nrepresent her, or if she does so in the \nfuture, and she decides to pursue a claim against [the defendant,] his attorney, [name] asks \nthat he be contacted at [firm name \nand address]. \nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and two other victims \nregarding the disclosure of the entire agreement between the United States and [defendant]. \nMr. Josefsberg can \nprovide further guidance on this issue, or if [the victim] selects another \nEFTA00014023\n\n[NAME OF VICTIM'S ATTORNEY] \nAMENDED NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIM [NAME] \n[DATE] \nPAGE 3 OF 3 \nattorney to represent her, that attorney can review the Court's order in the matter of In re \nJane Does 1 and 2, S.D. Fl. Court File No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA. \nAs I  stated in my earlier notification, please understand that neither the U.S. \nAttorney's Office nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation can take part in or otherwise assist \nin civil litigation, but we again thank you and your client for all of her assistance during the \ncourse of \nthis investigation. \nR.
