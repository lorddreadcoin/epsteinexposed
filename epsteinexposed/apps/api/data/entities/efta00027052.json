Once the search for the \nresponsiveness terms are run, please save the search so that we can take a look.

Epstein \nI am assuming that when we run the responsiveness terms and e-mail addresses we are excluding the junk documents \ncorrect? Also, once the search for the responsiveness terms are run what do you want to do with the documents? Will \nyou be conducting a review and will I need to batch these documents out for you? \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 15, 2020 3:41 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v. Epstein \nThanks =. I think we'd like to scrap this second search entirely. So please only keep the first search entitled \"Epstein —\nJunk Search Terms (From)\" and tag those hits as junk. Please run the responsiveness search terms on all of the remaining \ndocuments. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 15, 2020 3:11 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: RE: US v.

Do you not want the searches run on the full families? \nEFTA00027052\n\nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 15, 2020 3:06 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v. Epstein \nI've reviewed the searched in US v. Epstein (SW). The search entitled \"Epstein —  Junk Search Terms (From)\" looks \ngood to me. Please tag all of those as junk. \nThe search entitled \"Epstein —  Junk Search Terms (Keywords)\" seems to have caught up a number of documents that are \nnot junk and appear responsive to the warrant. It's not clear to me why that happened—the ones I'm seeing don't \nappear to have any of the keywords on the attached list. Is there a reason that would be? Also, I realized that this search \ncaught up a number of non-email documents. Would it be possible to run this search only on emails files, please? \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 15, 2020 2:12 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v.
