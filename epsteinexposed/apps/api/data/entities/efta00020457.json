The main house I was taken to is located behind \nThorpe Green, at the end of a private road. Hurst Farm Livery Stables is next door. In the driveway of this \nhouse, I was hit by a dark blue car with a personalised license plate ending in \"M\", driven by Prince \nAndrew. I was not taken to hospital, but I suffered permanent injuries to my ribs, hip and leg on my right \nside. The car's hood figurine broke off in my hand on impact and I later buried it near my home, so it could \nstill be recoverable as evidence. After I was hit by the car, I woke up to Prince Andrew \nIn that house, I was also \nI have medical records of the resulting infection. I once ran away \nfrom the house naked, and made it to the Irish Traveller community down the road (GPS: 51.405369, -\n0.546576). I remember seeing and speaking to a man, so I think that there may be Irish Travellers living in \nthe area who could corroborate what goes on there.   I was also taken to another house that I later \nrecognised as Frogmore Cottage when its refurbishment was in the news in 2018. There, I was restrained on \na table and tortured with electrical shocks by Ghislaine Maxwell and surrounded by watching men. I \nremember seeing Prince Andrew's face. I tried to sneak out. \nMaxwell caught me and beat me with the bristle end of a broom. \n. She also threatened me, saying that I \"deserved to die\" and hit me in the face with the broom, \nbreaking my nose. I was only taken to the hospital for the broken nose after a rugby match, so that the \ninjury could be blamed on that. \nUNCLASSIFIED \nEFTA00020457\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY-3027571, 08/15/2020 \nViolation: Other \nViolation Questions \nWhat was the exact crime that occurred?: Human trafficking and sexual assault against minors \nWhen did the crime/incident occur?

I remember on one occasion being driven by my father over an hour \naway to a mansion with a gated driveway and a large rectangular swimming pool. I was molested by a  man \nthat I later recognised as Epstein when he was in the news. He \n). He took pornographic p  otograp s o me in a  s Girt. \nAround late 2012, I had not yet fully processed all these memories, but I reported my father to the police \nafter seeing a text from G. Maxwell on his phone saying: \"I have two children\", and being triggered by it. I \nbelieve it's possible that my father may have been involved in procurement for the pedophile ring even \nthen, because he made visits to several local schools and a disabled children's home (the White Lodge \nCentre). In the end, he was not arrested and the case was not investigated. As a result, he was able to \ndestroy a lot of evidence, such as photographs. Releasing Ghislaine Maxwell on bail would lead to the same \noutcome. \nI am willing to testify, and provide evidence and/or more detailed descriptions of events. \nOther ring members - \nUNCLASSIFIED \n3 \nEFTA00020459\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY-3027571, 08/15/2020 \nMy father's best friend - \nMy father's 'secret accountant' - he lives in the house between \nGPS Coordinates: I heard my rapist from Frogmore Cottage at his house \nduring a \"party\" on a Saturday in the Summer of 2018. \nHow is Contact Known: I was a victim of human trafficking by her pedophile ring. \nType: Other \nAddress: \nCity: \nZip: \nWitness Information \nFirst Name: \nMiddle Name: \nLast Name: \nAge: 31 \nDOB: \nAdditional Info: I also remember another victim being \nShe is a year younger than me, so she may have been as young as 5 years-old at the time.
