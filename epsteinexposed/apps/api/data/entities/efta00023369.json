United States v. Dupigny, 18 CR 528, \ntranscript \nof October 17, 2019, Docket No. 198 at 50. It is appropriate \nfor the government to use the terms as representative of its \nlitigating position. If the \ngovernment does this in any way \nthat is atypical or \nunduly prejudicial, I will revisit. \nDefense only cites out-of-circuit or state court \ndecisions for the proposition that those terms are inherently \nprejudicial and harm the presumption of innocence. Numerous \ncourts of appeal disagree with that \nargument, particularly when \nthe presentation of evidence and the court's instructions \n\"taken as a whole clarify the \ngovernment's burden of proving \nall elements of the crime.\" United States v. Washburn, 444 \nF.3d, 1007, 1113 (8th Cir. 2006); see also, Server v. Mizell, \n902 F.2d 611, \n615, (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Granbois, \n119 \nF.App'x 35, 38-39 (9th Cir. 2004). \nDefendant's lone district court opinion does not tip \nthe balance of this authority. I will, of course, instruct the \njury repeatedly that the defendant is presumed innocent and \nthat it is the government's burden and the government's burden \nalone to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Those \ninstructions will \neliminate any potential prejudice. See again \nJudge \nFurman's decision in Dupigny, Docket No. 198 at 49 \nThat matter resolved, I \nwill turn to the government's \nfirst motion. This goes to \npseudonyms. The government moves \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023369\n\nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \npursuant to the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 USC Section \n3771, \nto permit certain witnesses and certain non-testifying \nwitnesses to be referred to by pseudonyms. And there is also \nthe issue of redacting related exhibits that contain the names \nor specifically identifying information. Specifically, the \ngovernment requests that eight individuals be referred to by \npseudonyms or their \nfirst name. \nThe defense is already aware of the identities of all \nof these individuals, and as the government proposes it, the \njury will also be \naware of the individuals' real identities. \nThe request only implicates how those individuals are referred \nto in \nopen court. \nThis is well-tread territory, and I will grant the \nrequest for the following reasons: \nThe burden to justify this type of request, of course, \nstarts with the government. It \"must provide a reason for the \nlimitation.\" United States v. Marcus, which is 2007 WL 330388 \nat *1, an \nEastern District decision citing United States v. \nMarti, 421 F.2d 1283 (2d \nCir. 1970). \nI agree with the government that limiting disclosure \nhere would protect the alleged victims from potential \nharassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment and \nother adverse consequences. The Court has an obligation under \nthe Crime Victims \nRights Act to take certain measures at trial \nto protect the dignity and privacy of alleged victims. 18 USC \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023370\n\nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSection 3771(a)(8). \nIt is quite common for \nalleged victims, both in cases \nthat have garnered media attention \nand those involving \nallegations of sex abuse, to testify or be referred to by \npseudonyms or first names. Courts have allowed this \nwhether or \nnot the alleged victims are minors or adults or adults \ntestifying about abuse that allegedly occurred when they \nwere \nminors. \nLet me give a bit of a string cite here. See, for \nexample, United States v. \nKelly, No. 19 CR 286, which is a high \npublicity trial \ninvolving adults testifying about sex abuse as \nminors, and that's in the Eastern District of New York; United \nStates v. Raniere, No. 18 \nCR 204, a high-publicity trial \ninvolving at \nleast one adult testifying about sex abuse as \nminor; United States \nv. Dupigny, No. 18 CR 528, involving sex \ntrafficking, United States \nv. Kelly, No. 7 CR 374, and that \ncould be found at 2008 WL 5068820, which is \nan Eastern District \ncase \ninvolving an adult testifying about sex abuse as a minor; \nUnited States v. Graham, No. 14 CR 500, found at 2015 WL \n6161292 (S.D.N.Y., \nOctober 2015), that involved adults \ntestifying \nabout sex trafficking as minors; United States v. \nGardner, No. 16 CR 20135, found at 2016 WL 5404207, \nan Eastern \nDistrict case from 2016 involving adults and adults testifying \nabout sex abuse as a minor, and collecting similar cases. \nThe \npractice has been widely permitted because \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023371\n\nLB1TMAX1 \nrequiring alleged victims to \npublicly provide their names could \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nchill their willingness to testify for fear of having their \npersonal histories publicized. Raniere, Docket No. 622 at 32. \nGiven the \nsensitive and inflammatory nature of the \nconduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment or \nembarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be \ndeterred from \ncoming forward. See, Martinez, 17 CR 281, \n(E.D.N.Y. 2017), \nDocket No. 34. \nLimiting the disclosure \nof alleged victims' identities \nin this case furthers these important interests. The same is \ntrue with \nthe identities of certain witnesses, although not \nalleged victims themselves, because the disclosure of their \nidentities would necessarily reveal the identities of the \nalleged \nvictims. \nI'm not persuaded by defense counsel's arguments to \nthe contrary. First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does \nnot pose a threat to any of the witnesses. \nThat is plainly \ntrue, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege \notherwise, but just because that reason \nfor limiting \ndisclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the \npossibility of other justifications. And again, there is a \nneed here to prevent undue embarrassment, \nharassment from the \npress and third parties, and any resistance of others to come \nforward and report alleged abuse. Cases establish that this is \nsufficient \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023372\n\nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMoreover, any potential prejudice in this regard \ncan \nbe cured with an appropriate \ninstruction explaining that the \nreason for the precaution is regard for the witnesses' and \nalleged victims' privacy, and \nthat no inference can or should \nbe drawn against the defendant because of these precautions \nMy colleagues in this district and elsewhere have used \nsuch an \ninstruction in similar cases. The defense's concern \nthat this sort of instruction affords \"Court-sanctioned \nsympathy and credibility\" is unfounded. My instructions on the \nlaw will clearly and \nrepeatedly instruct the jury on the \npresumption of innocence and their sole role in assessing \nwitness credibility \nNor am I persuaded by the defense's arguments that the \nfact that some alleged victims have \npreviously publicly \ndisclosed some of their allegations obviates the need to limit \ndisclosure. As another district court has held, \"just because \nsome \nvictims' names are publicly available does not mean that \nthe details of their experience are already available.\" \nRaniere, Docket No. \n662 at 34, n. 17 \nAs I acknowledged in my protective order for this \ncase, \"Not all accusations and public statements are equal. \nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal \ninvestigation or prosecution is a far different matter than \nsimply making a public statement \nrelating to Ms. Maxwell or \nJeffrey Epstein.\" \nDocket No. 37 in this case at 2. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023373\n\nIC \nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe \ngovernment anticipates that the alleged victims \nwill \"testify in \nexplicit detail and/or be the subject of \nhighly \nsensitive and personal testimony concerning illegal \nsexual abuse. Thus, there's good reasons to limit public \ndisclosure of their names \nand specifically identifying \ninformation during trial in this \nhighly publicized case \ninvolving highly \nsensitive issues.\" \nSince there is a valid reason to limit disclosure in \nthis case, the defense must proffer a particularized need for \nthe disclosure of the \nrelevant information, which is weighed \nagainst the risks to the witnesses. I'll cite here, for \nexample, United States v. Marcus, again citing the Second \nCircuit case in United States v. Marti. \nAs both parties acknowledge, the \ngovernment's request \npotentially implicates the defendant's right under the Sixth \nAmendment's confrontation clause which guarantees defendants \nthe right \nto cross-examine adverse witnesses. The Second \nCircuit has identified two central interests defendants have in \nthe public airing of identifying \ninformation about witnesses. \nAgain referencing the Marti case, 421 F.2d \n1263. \nThe first is \nnot relevant here because, as I have \nnoted, the defense is aware of the alleged victims' and \nwitnesses' identities. \nThe defendant argues that the second interest, \nhowever, is \nimplicated. Namely, defense may need the witness \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023374\n\nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nto reveal identifying \ninformation because knowledge of that \ninformation by the jury \nmight be important to its deliberations \nas to the witness's credibility or \nknowledgability. That's \nquoting the Marti case again. In particular, the defense \nargues that revealing the alleged victims' and witnesses' \nidentities is necessary to probe the nature of the alleged \nvictims' occupations as relevant to the credibility and elicit \ncertain \nimpeachment evidence. \nI agree that such cross-examination cannot be unduly \nlimited and the government concedes the same. The government's \nmotions in limine 15, n. 6; government reply at 17 to \n18. And \nI will ensure \nthat it is not. \nMy decision today grants the government's request to \nlimit \nthe public disclosure of the alleged victims and some \nwitnesses' names and other \nspecifically identifying \ninformation, such as the specific names of current and past \nemployers, names of \nfamily members and addresses. \nLimiting disclosure of the specifically identifying \ninformation does not limit the anticipated cross-examination \nthat the defense described in its \npapers. All lines of inquiry \nthe defense outlined in its response are available without \ndisclosing specific names of employers or other specifically \nidentifying information. For example, \nthe defense can probe \nthe genre, nature, and trajectories of witnesses' careers \nwithout eliciting the specific employer name, but the defense's \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023375\n\n12 \nLB1TMAX1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncross-examination should not \ninclude specifically identifying \ninformation, and counsel must act responsibly doing so. If, \nafter good \nfaith effort in that regard is made and the defense \nat some point feels they have hit a wall and can articulate a \nspecific need with respect to a particular line of questioning, \nthey can reraise the issue with opposing \ncounsel and with me. \nSo that's my ruling on that motion. That said, I do \nstrongly encourage the government to speak \ncandidly with the \nanticipated witnesses so that they're clear eyed about what \nthis process will entail, the fact that \ncross-examination will \nnot be curtailed beyond the specific \nidentifying information \nthat \nform the basis of the government's request, and the \npossibility that despite these measures their identities may \nbecome known and revealed to the public. \nShould any of those \nwitnesses or the government choose \nnot to proceed by pseudonym, the government \nshall let defense \ncounsel and the Court know. In the \nmeantime, the government \nand defense counsel shall confer about names that will be used \nand any additional process for facilitating the clear \npresentation of evidence. The Court will adopt a clear and \nstraightforward approach and the parties are admonished to come \nto agreement on the use of pseudonyms and/or first names. \nFirst assignment, there \nwill be others, by November 10 \nthe parties shall submit a joint letter to the Court under seal \nexplaining the \nnomenclature that they propose be employed with \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023376\n\nLB1TMAX1 \nrespect to the actual identity of each witness. \nAs I mentioned, I do agree with the government that \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nlimiting instruction explaining the \nreasons for the precautions \nis appropriate. In light of my \nruling, I expect the parties to \nconfer and jointly propose such a limiting instruction. \nHomework No. 2. This shall also \nbe filed jointly by \nNovember 10, and that can be filed on ECF. \nThere are some logistics of voir dire related to this. \nSome of my colleagues have used the list method that the \ngovernment proposes on page 15, footnote 5 of their motion, and \nI agree that this proposal makes sense. Once again, the \nparties shall confer and submit on ECF by \nNovember 10 a joint \nproposal for any logistical issues related to this for voir \ndire. \nThat leaves the issue of sealing unredacted \nexhibits \nand the limited redacting of exhibits containing specific \npersonal identifying information. The government shall manage \nthe logistics of this process throughout trial. So think \nthrough and include in your November 10 submission on ECF the \nspecifics of this part of the process so that the trial \nexhibits can be contemporaneously marked \nwith the appropriate \nlimited redactions, and the government will need \nto manage this \non an ongoing \nbasis throughout trial. \nGovernment's motion 2, \nthe alleged victims' prior \nconsistent statements. So this goes to the admissibility of \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n(212) \n805-0300 \nEFTA00023377",
