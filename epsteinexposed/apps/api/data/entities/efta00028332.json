For the past eight years, I have been working with anti-child abuse campaigner \nBill Maloney in raising awareness of the true extent of the scale of this heinous crime. I, now with other whistleblowing cops as well as \nvictims and survivors of abuse, am campaigning for a change in the Law to give brave whistleblowers the protection they truly deserve. In \nthe words of Edmund Burke: 'All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing? \nSince I stood up and exposed the vile crimes against children (which were suppressed for decades). I  faced a sustained and aggressive \nonslaught designed not just to silence me but to ultimately destroy me. \nI was threatened and bullied out of my job \nThis attack strengthened my resolve, and I embarked on a journey where I have met brave. kind. compassionate individuals comprised of \nfellow whistleblowers. victims, and survivors of abuse. If whistleblowers do not receive adequate, independent, and secure protection then \nthe horrific abuse of society's most vulnerable and precious members will continue. \nI graciously and respectfully ask that you back my campaign. Thank you to everyone who have already generously donated. Please \ncontinue supporting justice by donating to our ongoing cause. \nLinks to my recent press newspaper. video interviews and articles can be viewed via my website.
