We want to be \nable to tag each document with multiple tags if appropriate. \nEFTA00028041\n\nAlso, in the same \"US v Epstein\" database, would it be possible to please rename the folder entitled \"Florida Investigation \nFOIA Files_2\" to \"FBI Files from Florida Office\"? The new title will help us understand what is actually in that folder. \nThanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, September 21, 2020 8:46 AM \nTo: \nCc:\nSubject: RE: Tags for US v.
