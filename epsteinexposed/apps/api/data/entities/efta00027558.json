She is \ncurrently legally in the U.S. on a work visa, but that expires when her passport expires in August of 2020. We've never \ndealt with T-Visas before, so would appreciate any guidance you might be able to provide. Would qualify for a T-\nVisa? If so, what would the process be for sponsoring her? \nAlso happy to have a call if that's easier, or if there's someone else we should reach out to, please let me know. \nThanks, \nEFTA00027558",
