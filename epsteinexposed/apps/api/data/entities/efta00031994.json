The record came from Associate Warden Will you please reach out to her, give her the \nstandard voluntariness warning, and ask her where the sign came from? Can you please ask how she got it, whether she \ntook it from the SHU, and when. Can you also ask who created it and hung it up? It is possible she was given this \ndocument by someone else and won't know the answer to the majority of these questions. If that's the case, we'll want \nto find out who had the sign / who knows the information and interview that person. If, on the other hand, she is \nknowledgeable about the sign (including why it was hung and who took it down and when), and I will want to \ninterview her by phone. Of course, do a  302/MOI. Thanks very much and let us know if you have any questions. \nFrom: . (OIG) \nSent: Monday, July 27, 2020 10:53 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \n< \n.

If memory serves, we never recovered the document. But \nlast week we got a production of records from the BOP as part of FOIA litigation that included the attached. Can you \nremind us (a) if there was in fact some employee who told us about this sign — I haven't looked at all the 302s and MOls, \nand (b) of anything we did to try to get this sign previously (if we did in fact make inquiries). \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nTel: \nCell: \nEFTA00031996",
