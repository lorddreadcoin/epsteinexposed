As noted in \nMr. Epstein's bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial \ndisclosure. Counsel's advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and \ncompleteness of the information provided to the Court. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his \nforthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies \non the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates \nspecifically to his finances. Under the Bail Reform Act, fmancial information provided by a \ndefendant to a pretrial services officer \"shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination \nand shall otherwise be confidential.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3153(c)(1). Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is \nrequired to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be \nwidely disseminated in the news media, contravening the statutory requirement of confidentiality. \n1 \nEFTA00028985\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 7 Filed 07/11/19 Page 2 of 3 \nWHEREFORE, Mr. Epstein respectfully requests that this Honorable Court allow him leave \nto file his supplemental financial disclosure under seal. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJeffrey Epstein \nBy His Attorneys, \n/s/ Reid Weingarten \nReid Weingarten \nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC) \n1114 Avenue of the Americas \nNew York, NY 10036 \n(202)-506-3900 \nIs/ Martin G.
