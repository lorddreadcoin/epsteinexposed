Anyone I can point them toward on that issue?? This seems way outside \nour lane but not sure who else they could ask. Thanks and sorry for the unusual question. \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Miller, Michael\" <1 \nDate: August 10 2019 at 19:34:37 EDT \nTo:\" \nSubject: RE: US v  Epstein \n\"Martin G. Weinberg\" \nThanks for being available today and for getting the wheels turning for an investigation into how he died. \nOn a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to have \na pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any way to \npush the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that? \nMike \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:31 PM \nTo: Miller, Michael .it=> \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v Epstein \nMike, Marty, Reid, \n14e \n; Martin \nG. Weinberg < \n>; Weingarten, Reid \nI just wanted to let you know that I don't expect we'll have any further updates today, and so wanted to send you a brief \nnote to let you know that since we hadn't otherwise been in touch since earlier this afternoon. I imagine we will \ncontinue to be in contact in the coming days; meanwhile, I appreciate you being in touch today, and I hope the \ninvestigations of these events will be thorough and swift. \nrespectfully, \nEFTA00027858",
