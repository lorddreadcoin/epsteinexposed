(USAFLS) \nSubject: RE: A new lawsuit against Epstein \nI saw it. \nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel.com \nPalm Beach billionaire faces second sex-assault lawsuit \nBy Nancy \n°then \nSun-Sentinel.com \n12:01 PM EST, February 6, 2008 \nBillionaire and part-time Palm Beach resident Jeffrey Epstein was sued for the second time in less than two \nweeks Wednesday, this time by another teenager who claims she was sexually abused at his mansion. \nThe 16-year-old Virginia girl is represented by the same attorney who filed a $50 million federal lawsuit in late \nJanuary against Epstein, 55. This lawsuit seeks similar damages for an alleged sexual assault and intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. \nJeffrey Herman, the teen's attorney, is planning a news conference in West Palm Beach this afternoon to discuss \nthe allegations. \nEFTA00013776\n\nEpstein, arrested in 2006 on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, is scheduled to appear in court next \nmonth for a status hearing. The New York resident is accused of luring young girls to his mansion for massages \nthat turned sexual. \nThe lawsuit alleges that Epstein has a sexual preference and \"obsession for underage minor girls\" and sought to \ngain access to economically disadvantaged younger girls in his home for paid massages. \nThe 16-year-old girl, identified in the lawsuit as \"Jane Doe No. 2,\" has suffered traumatic injuries, according to \nthe complaint. \nWhen the first lawsuit was filed Epstein's attorneys said Epstein never had sex with the girl, who was 14 at the \ntime, and that the lawsuit was motivated by greed. \nFrom: \n(USAFLS) \nSent: Wednesday, February 06, 2008 4:37 PM \nTo: \n(USAFLS) \nSubject: A  new lawsuit against Epstein \nHi M— Herman filed another lawsuit on behalf of a girl from Virginia.
