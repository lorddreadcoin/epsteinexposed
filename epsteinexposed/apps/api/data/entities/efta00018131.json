In particular, we are \ninvestigating MCC staff's (i) decision not to reassign a cellmate to Epstein on August 9, 2019, contrary to regular BOP \npractice and direct orders from the Warden; (ii) the failure of correctional officers assigned to the Special Housing Unit \n(\"SHU\") at which Epstein was housed the night of August 9, 2019, to perform the required overnight counts and 30-\nminute checks; and (iii) the falsification of records related to those count slips and 30-minute checks, in violation of Title \n18, United States Code, Section 1519. \nWe are also investigating any efforts, following Epstein's death, to obstruct justice by destroying relevant records at MCC. \nIn particular, we learned today that all institutional count slips for dates prior to August 10, 2019, which we requested on \nAugust 12, 2019, are apparently \"missing.\" Today, we received a tip from a guard at MCC that while the guard was \nstationed at the rear gate, inmate brought down bales of shredded paper on Thursday and Friday of last \nweek (August 15 and 16), and reported that he had been asked to shred documents by the BOP after-action team \n(although it is not clear from the tip whether took part in any shredding) and that \"they are shredding everything.\" \nWe would like to interview regarding these events. is a sentenced defendant who was prosecuted out of the \nDistrict and is currently serving a term of imprisonment related to \nThe assigned AUSA has no objection to us interviewing =. Investigating agents will seek to interview at \nMCC, and will direct him not to discuss his prior criminal case or VOSR. We believe that will be more likely to \ncooperate and be forthcoming in this setting, rather than going through his attorney. The proposed contact is permissible \nunder Hammad for several reasons. First, is not represented in connection with his status as a potential witness. \nSecond, agents will be instructed not ask any questions about his prior criminal case. Accordingly, the proposed \ncontact is permissible. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nEFTA00018131",
