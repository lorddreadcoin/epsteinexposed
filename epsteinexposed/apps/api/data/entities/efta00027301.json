Stemheim \n33 West 19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 \nCr. 330 (MN) \nDear Counsel: \nToday we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These discovery materials \nare stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02753644 through SDNY_GM_02753697. \nPlease note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, \n2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as \"confidential,\" because it \nincludes information regarding records designated as \"confidential\" under the Protective \nOrder. Recently, the Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of \nmaterials marked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings \nreserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this \nproduction under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today \nare marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, \n8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order \nthat govern today's production. \nEFTA00027301\n\nPage 2 \nAn index of the materials contained in this production is below: \nBates Start Bates End Summary Description Confidential \nDesignation \nSDNY GM 02753644 SDNY GM 02753684 \nFiles Recovered from Discs \nSeized from Epstein NY \nResidence \nConfidential \nSDNY GM_02753685 SDNY GM_02753692 \nDe-Designated Images from \nEpstein's Electronic Devices \nConfidential \nSDNY_GM_02753693 SDNY GM_02753695 \nMissouri Records \nConfidential \nSDNY_GM_02753696 SDNY \nGM_02753696 JPMorgan Chase Return \nConfidential \nSDNY GM 02753697 SDNY GM 02753697 Oxford Letter, \n11-07-1995 \nConfidential \nPlease note that the files recovered from discs seized from Jeffrey Epstein's New York \nresidence and the De-Designated Images from Epstein's Electronic Devices are being produced to \nyou with html files that contain thumbnails of each image and any recovered metadata next to each \nthumbnail. In order to view the full size image from a particular row in the html file, click on the \nthumbnail, which will automatically open up the full size image from within the folder structure \nmaintained in the folder entitled \"Files.\" Use of these html files does not require Internet access, \nbut does require that the file structure within the folder entitled \"Files\" remain unchanged. \nAdditionally, certain of the files that were recovered from the discs seized from Epstein's New \nYork residence are not viewable on the FBI's system. In the interest of completeness, however, \nwe are producing to you every file that was recovered from those discs, including those that are \nnot openable or viewable. \nThe Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly \nproduce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate \nto reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials. \nVery truly yours, \nUnited States Attome \nby \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nEFTA00027302",
