Main (OPA) is keenly interested \nbecause of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate \nsafety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is \nEFTA00017830\n\ngetting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.) \nChief Public Information Officer \nU.S. \nAttome % Office SDNY \n(office) \n(cell) \nEFTA00017831",
