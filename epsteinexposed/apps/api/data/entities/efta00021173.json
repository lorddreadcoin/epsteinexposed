    "text": "\n\nHi everyone. \nLast week had some very notable achievements: \na $678 million civil settlement with Novartis for years of paying illicit \nkickbacks; \nand also the arrest of GELANE Maxwell, a co-conspirator of Jeffrey \nEpstein. \nI cheer both of those the teams that worked so hard to bring those \nworthy cases. \nOf course, some of our most important achievements happen out of \nthe spotlight, and I want to celebrate everyone who has: \n• taken on new gun cases to combat our District's recent rise in \nviolence; \n• chipped in to skillfully handle the increase in FOIA litigation; and \n• diligently prepared thoughtful responses to compassionate \nrelease motions. \nAnd many thanks to all of our AUSAs, paralegals, and staff who are \nshouldering the work of the Office every day. \nWe miss seeing you, but even when you are out of sight, we know we \nare lucky to have you. \nStay safe and keep up the great work. \nEFTA00021173",
