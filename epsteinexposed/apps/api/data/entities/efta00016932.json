Thanks! \n• Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day \n• We do not need a conference room \n• Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. \n• Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. \n• If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of \nthis if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. \nThanks a bunch. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, December 11, 2019 10:01 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n> \n; \nce; \n>; \n>; \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nApproved \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, December 11, 2019 9:58 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n> \n> \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nS \n) \nSimilar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request \npermission for the team to travel next week for an interview (or possibly interviews) in Los Angeles on December 16 \nand/or 17.
