    "text": "\n\nFrom: Robert Lewi \nTo: \nSubject: Epstein --\nDate: Thu, 25 Jul 2019 18:11:08 +0000 \nDeai \nI represent a potential witness in your case. As you will recall, we spoke about Mr. \nback in March, when you \nre\nached out to see if Mr. would speak to you and we agreed that you could. \nAlthough you have not contacted Mr. = I  thought you should know about some recent developments. \nFor the last week or so the New York Times (Mike McIntire) has been aggressively reaching out to Mr. =, \nJesse Rose this employment lawyer) and me (who represented him in the Maxwell case) by email andi  , as \nwella to Mr. home twice. He is seeking our comments and information concerning the and \nMr. testimony in the Maxwell case. \nAccording to McIntire, the Times is planning to run story on th and their ties to Epstein. It also appears \nthat the Times has a copy of all or a portion of the deposition Mr. gave in the Maxwell case, which is \ntroubling because it was subject to confidentiality in that case and, although the Second Circuit has ordered the \nunsealing of the summary judgment papers (which likely include references to Mr. deposition \ntestimony), no mandate has issued or documents been unsealed. \nIn addition, the Times tells us that a \"representative\" of the has told it that Mr. \"lied\" in his \ndeposition. If a representative did that, it is both defamatory and breaches a non-disparagement provision in the \nMi  msettlement agreement with Mr. . The Times also informs that flight documents purportedly do not \ncorroborate certain portions of Mr. deposition. We do not have access to those flight documents, but we \nunderstand that Epstein's flight documentation is incomplete, if not materially inaccurate. Also pursuant to his \nsettlement of his silent dispute with the Mr. \ndestroyed all of the documents he possessed \npertaining to the which might corroborate some of his testimony, \nWe have rebuffed the Times' entreaties because of confidentiality obligations has pursuant to a settlement \nagreement in the employment case and the confidentiality order in the Maxwell case, as well as his desire to \navoid doing anything that would undermine your criminal prosecution. \nShould you need or want a copy of Mr. deposition transcript in the Maxwell case, we would provide it to \nyou pursuant to subpoena. \nIf you wish to discuss these matters, please do not hesitate to call. \nBest regards, \nBob Lewis \nROBERT Y.
