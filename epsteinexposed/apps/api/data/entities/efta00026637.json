I've copied my colleagues, \nhave everyone's contact information. \nand S so that you \nIn terms of scheduling a call tomorrow, we are going to be tied up in the morning, and the afternoon is a bit uncertain \ngiven that we are not sure yet of the timing of the presentment for Mr. Epstein. I think it would make sense to plan for a \ncall at 4, and we can let you know if we need to reschedule, if that's alright with you. \nEFTA00026637\n\nAttached is the subpoena for Ms. Maxwell. The indictment is currently under seal, but we anticipate that it will be \nunsealed tomorrow morning and publicly available. Please let us know tomorrow if you have any difficulty and we can \ncertainly send you a copy. \nThanks very much, and looking forward to discussing further tomorrow. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \n(212) 637-2225 \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, July 7, 2019 3:09 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Maxwell \nDear \nIt was a  pleasure talking to you today. As we discussed, I am authorized to accept service of the subpoena for testimony \nissued to Ms. Maxwell by the Grand Jury, SDNY. I expect that we will need to coordinate a mutually convenient time to \neither appear or proffer, either in advance or in lieu of any testimony. \nI will be in court tomorrow morning and afternoon, so I have a small window to discuss the matter- probably between \n11am and noon and then again at around 4pm my time which is 2 hrs. earlier than the East Coast. My staff will attempt to \nobtain a copy of the Epstein indictment as soon as it is publicly available. In my experience this can sometimes be difficult \nso If it is not an inconvenience perhaps you could email the indictment along with the subpoena and waiver. \nBest Regards, \n• \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East 10th Avenue \nDenver, Colorado 80203 \nMain \nwww.hmflaw.com \nEFTA00026638\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This e-mail transmission, and any documents, files or previous e-mail messages attached to it may contain \ninformation that is confidential or legally privileged.
