Our view is that we do not need to collect those \nemails from because we have already received thousands of emails, which were collected by OPR and \nshould encompass any emails with the FBI about the Epstein case. is going to send us any emails he received from \nvictims or witnesses. We also discussed other documentsM has in his possession from the Epstein investigation and \nasked him to send us any that sounded potentially discoverable. \nPlease let us know if this approach sounds right to you or if you would like to discuss. \nThanks, \nEFTA00013239",
