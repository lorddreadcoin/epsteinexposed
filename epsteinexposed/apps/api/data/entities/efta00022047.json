I am currently in the White Plains office sending out a hard drive for the \nproduction. I will check the link when I get back to my computer and have my RSA token. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, October 14, 2020 10:48 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Discovery Tasks for Maxwell on Epstein Relativity Databases \nThanks When I click on the link you sent, it brings me to the \"FBI Files from Florida Office\" folder, but it appears to \nbring up all 26,164 documents in that folder, when the production should be a smaller number of documents bearing the \ntags I listed below. Are you free for a call to discuss? \nFrom \nSent: Wednesday, October 14, 2020 10:02 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Discovery Tasks for Maxwell on Epstein Relativity Databases \nGood Morning \nThank you for the e-mail. Just to confirm can you please review the below search and let me know that everything that is \nin the search is everything you wish to produce for item three. I want to make sure that we have everything you need \nbefore we start the imaging process. \nEFTA00022047\n\nThank you. \nFro \nSent: Tuesday, October 13, 2020 11:17 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Discovery Tasks for Maxwell on Epstein Relativity Databases \nThanks very much for speaking earlier today. As discussed, we are asking for the following three productions to be \nprepared for the Maxwell case. I've listed those tasks below in the order in which we discussed them, but, as we \ndiscussed, if you and the vendor believe a different order would be more efficient, please just let me know. \nEFTA00022048\n\nAs we've discussed, we need all of these materials to be delivered to 1St. Andrews by the end of October in order to \nmeet our discovery deadline. \nFinally, I believe should be sending you a drive containing the scans of boxes of files from the USAO-SDFL. \nWe need all of those files loaded into the US v Epstein database on Relativity in a new folder entitled \"USAO-SDFL Files,\" \nASAP so that we can review them, please. \nThanks very much, as always for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions or \nconfusion. I'm always happy to chat. \nThanks so much, \nEFTA00022049",
