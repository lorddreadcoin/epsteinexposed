I appreciate that you have more \npressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SONY's \ninvestigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against \nother defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. \nJust anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant in \na case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I think \nyou brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. So \ndespite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, heads \nshould be held high. \nBest, \nJenna \nJenne Dabbs I  Kaplan Hecker & Fink LIP \n35o Fifth Avenue I  Suite 7no \nNew \n(W) \nEFTA00028541\n\nThis email and its attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or protected from disclosure by the attorney-client. work product or other \napplicable legal privilege.
