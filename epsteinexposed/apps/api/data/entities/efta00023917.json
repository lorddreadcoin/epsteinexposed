    "text": "\n\n@SDNYNews Priorities \nJUNE, 2021 \nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman charged with conspiring to violate straw and foreign donor bans: In \nOctober 2019, four defendants were charged in a four-count indictment alleging that each of \nthe defendants conspired to violate the ban on foreign donations and contributions in \nconnection with federal and state elections. In addition, Parnas and Fruman were charged with \nconspiring to make contributions in connection with federal elections in the names of others, \nand with making false statements to and falsifying records to obstruct the administration of a \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\"). \nGhislaine Maxwell charged for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors: In July \n2020, Maxwell was arrested and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal \nsexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, \nconspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn \ndeposition. The Indictment unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 \nthrough 1997, Maxwell and co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, \nincluding by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the purpose of engaging in illegal \nsex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, Maxwell played a \ncritical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations including \nNew York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, Maxwell made several false \nstatements in sworn depositions in 2016. \nProposed: \nJennifer Shah (elder abuse) \nKolfage, et al. \nHadden \nDPRK Boat Seizure \nNygard \nHonduran Ntl Police Chief \nRikers guards smuggling to inmates? \nHorseracing indictments? \nEFTA00023917",
