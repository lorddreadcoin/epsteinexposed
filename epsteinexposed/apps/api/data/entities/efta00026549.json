Understanding that you provided a preliminary response when we spoke on \nFriday, I expect that the final response to that particular account, as well as the issue of Ms. recollection \n(if any) of any other instances more generally in which she observed Jeffrey Epstein engaged in any sexual \nactivity, or observed other women or girls in sexually-suggestive circumstances (nude or partially nude in the \npresence of Epstein, for example, or in connection with massages), other than what you and/or she has already \ndiscussed, is of particular importance and relevance in our and our supervisors' consideration, and we will \nimmediately incorporate any such response into our ongoing discussions and briefings with them whenever we \nreceive it. \nthanks again, \n Original Messa e \nFrom: \nSent: Monda Janu 13 2020 14:25 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: - Following up re proffers \nProbably makes sense to do it another time.

On our end, we need to coordinate at least 10 people's schedules so we'll \nneed some ranges to make sure everyone who you will want to hear your presentation can attend. \nEFTA00026550\n\nAs we mentioned on the phone, there is a strong view that there are offenses that can be charged now, so it is also \npossible to have this discussion post-charge, but we certainly would prefer to have the conversation before that, \nand while the issues are very fresh in everyone's minds here. Our supervisor's view is that the 30th/31st is a long \nway off. \nthanks, \n Ori inal Messa e \nFrom: \nSent: Monda Janua 13 2020 12:10 \nTo: \nCc: • \n• \nSubject: RE: - Following up re proffers \nUnderstood.

Are you available to speak tomorrow at 10 am? \nEFTA00026553\n\nSubject: RE: - Following up re proffers \nAs we flagged for you a week ago, and as ex we had a meeting with the office leadership today to discuss \nthe status of the case in general and Ms. in particular. We continue to believe that it would be helpful to \nreceive any clarifications, as well as any response to the complaint originally sent on December 4, as soon as \npossible; we are available tomorrow or over the weekend if there is a time that works for you. If it remains \nimpossible to talk before Tuesday, we have 2:30 in our calendar for then, but with a hard stop at 3:30 so please \nlet us know if you'd like to start the discussion earlier if you expect it might be useful to have additional time. \nMore generally, you had requested the opportunity to present to the ultimate decision-makers in the case if it \nappeared that charges were likely, and based on our meeting today, the Office would like to provide you that \nopportunity. If you could please let us know what dates and times you are available in the ranges of January 15-\n17 and 21-22, we will figure out a time when all the relevant supervisors here are available. I  expect that meeting \nwill include at least the U.S. Attorney, the Deputy U.S. Attorney and the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision (M), and some combination of the Chief Counsel , the \nCounsel \nthe two Public Corruption Unit chiefs , the line assistants, and/or FBI \ninvestigative and supervisory personnel. We will be prepared to discuss that meeting with you via phone when \nwe speak as well, which is one reason I note that we can begin our discussion earlier than 2:30 on Tuesday (or \nblock off significant time to talk before then) if that would be useful. \nEFTA00026554\n\nthank you, \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \nSouthern District of New York \n Ori inal Messa e \nFrom: \nSent: Sunda , Janu 05, 2020 18:15 \nTo: \n> \nCc: \nSubject: RE: - Following up re proffers \nWe'll block off that time in the calendar and plan to talk with you then. \nthanks, \n Original Message \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, January 04, 2020 22:30 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: - Following up re proffers \nEFTA00026555\n\nSony for the delay in my response.

We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week \nwe'll be having meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward \nfor aspects of the case including Ms. . In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you were \nprepared (and willing) to convey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in the \ncomplaint sent on December 4 (re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you have \nadditional information that would be helpful to convey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the \ncoming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come back, obviously we understand the challenges of \nscheduling, but we had anticipated trying to see if we could schedule a call in the coming days.
