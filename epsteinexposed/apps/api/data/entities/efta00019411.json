Jeffrey Epstein, 19-CRIM-00490 (S.D.N.Y.) \nDear Ms. Maguire, \nWe represent Jeffrey Epstein, Reg No. 76318-054, who was previously \nincarcerated at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York, New York (the \"MCC\") \nwhile awaiting trial on federal charges in the above-captioned case. We have been \nauthorized by his estate to write pursuant to 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.21-16.26 to request \ndocuments and records from the U.S. Department of Justice related to Mr. Epstein. \nSpecifically, we are seeking: any (1) protocols relating to the response \nto/investigation of inmate deaths within the MCC; (2) video recordings of all entrances \nand exits to the MCC; (3) entry and exit \nlogs for the \nMCC; (4) \nvideo \nrecordings of the \nhallways of the floor on which Mr. Epstein's cell was located; and (5) logs related to the \nguards on duty at the MCC (collectively, the \"Requested Evidence\"). The applicable \ntime period for the requests is from 7:oo am on Friday, August 9, 2019 until 8:00 am on \nSaturday, August to, 2019. As required by the regulations, we set forth below a \nsummary of the relevance of the Requested Evidence. \nMr. Epstein died in federal custody in his cell at the MCC. We are troubled by the \ncircumstances of his death and by reports of irregularities at the facility. According to a \nstatement issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons: \nOn Saturday, August to, 2019, at approximately 6:3o a.m., inmate Jeffrey \nEdward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit \nEFTA00019411\n\nAugust 20, 2019 \nPage 2 \nfrom an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New \nYork, New York. Life-saving measures were initiated immediately by responding \nstaff. Staff requested emergency medical services (EMS) and life-saving efforts \ncontinued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local hospital for treatment \nof life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff. \nThe FBI is investigating the incident. \nIn a separate statement, Attorney General William P. Barr indicated that \"Mr. Epstein's \ndeath raises serious questions that must be answered.\" On August 12, Mr. Barr further \nstated, \"We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply \nconcerning and that demand a thorough investigation.\" \nMoreover, there was initial uncertainty about the cause and manner of Mr. \nEpstein's death. The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner (\"OCME\") \ndeclined to immediately release a determination, citing the need for \"further \ninformation.\" Days later, the OCME announced that it had reached a conclusion \nfollowing a \"careful review of all investigative information.\" \nWe intend to conduct our own investigation into the circumstances of Mr. \nEpstein's death. In order to do so, we ask that the Requested Evidence be made \navailable to \ncounsel. \nPlease let us know if you would like to discuss this request. \nSincerely, \nMichael Miller Miller \nSteptoe & \nJohnson LLP \n1114 Avenue of the \nAmericas \nNew York, NY \n10036 \nMartin G.
