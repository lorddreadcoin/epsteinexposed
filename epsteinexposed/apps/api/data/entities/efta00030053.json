Thanks! \nCase name: United States v. Turkiye Hall( Bankasi AS, a/k/a \"Halkbank\" \nDocket number: S6 15 Cr. 867 (RMB) \nBrief description of the charges/claims: In October 2019, USAO-SDNY charged Halkbank with fraud, money laundering, \nand sanctions offenses related to the bank's participation in a  multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on \nIran. As set forth in the indictment, an investigation by USAO-SDNY and the FBI revealed that Halkbank and its officers, \nagents, and co-conspirators directly and indirectly used money service businesses and front companies in Iran, Turkey, \nthe United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere to violate and to evade and avoid prohibitions against Iran's access to the U.S. \nfinancial system, restrictions on the use of proceeds of Iranian oil and gas sales, and restrictions on the supply of gold to \nthe Government of Iran and to Iranian entities and persons. Halkbank knowingly facilitated the scheme, participated in \nthe design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks, and lied to U.S. regulators \nabout Halkbank's involvement. USAO-SDNY previously tried and convicted Halkbank's former Deputy General Manager \nof International Banking at Halkbank for his participation in the scheme. \nCurrent case status: Trial is scheduled for May 2021. On December 23, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed proceedings in \nthe district court pending expedited resolution of Halkbank's mandamus petition challenging the district court's denial \nof a motion to dismiss pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. \nLink to most recent press release (if applicable): https://www.j ustice.gov/usao-sd ny/prhurkish-ba nk-charged-\nma nhattan-federa l-court-its-pa rtici \npation-m ultibillion-dolla r \nCase name: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell \nDocket number: 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nBrief description of the charges/claims: In July 2020, USAO-SDNY charged Maxwell in a six-count indictment with \nfacilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The \ncharges resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-\nconspirators, including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom \nEFTA00030054\n\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, \nand she took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel \nto Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and \nsubjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in \nillegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. In a later effort to cover \nup her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with \nminor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. \nCurrent case status: Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, \nmost recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021. \nLink to most recent press release (if applicable): https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdnyip_dghislaine-maxwell-charged-\nmanhattan-federal-court-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually . \nEFTA00030055",
