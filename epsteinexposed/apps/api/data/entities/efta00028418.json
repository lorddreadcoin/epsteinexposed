Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear Judge Berman: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's motion for \nleave to file a supplemental financial disclosure under seal (the \"Sealing Motion\") in connection \nwith his motion for pretrial release (the \"Bail Motion\"). \nThe Government takes no position on the defendant's application, but notes that as of this \nfiling the Government still has not yet received any financial disclosure or information from the \ndefense in connection with the defendant's application for bail. It  is now more than three days \nfollowing the defendant's initial presentment, more than seven hours after the defendant's deadline \nto file his Motion, and less than 24 hours before the Government's deadline to reply. There is no \nreason that the defendant need have waited until this evening to submit his Sealing Motion, and \nthe Government cannot meaningfully respond to a Bail Motion that contains no material financial \ninformation, either under seal or otherwise. \nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that its deadline to respond to the \ndefendant's Bail Motion be extended to at least 24 hours following the defendant's disclosure of \nany financial information upon which he intends to rely in connection with the Motion. Should \nEFTA00028418\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 8 Filed 07/11/19 Page 2 of 2 \nHonorable Richard M.
