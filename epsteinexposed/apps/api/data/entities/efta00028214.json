Looks like items 1 and 2 are done, so when we talk this morning let's discuss a timetable for getting \nstuff docketed. I think and I should probably handle 1 and 2, since have a packed Daubed \nevening, but let's coordinate. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028214",
