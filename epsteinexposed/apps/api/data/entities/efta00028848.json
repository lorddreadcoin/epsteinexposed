I will also ask our civil clerk. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Mar 12, 2021, at 10:59 AM, \nHi=, \nwrote: \nIn connection with a criminal discovery matter, and and I are trying to find a list of all Jeffrey Epstein-\nrelated FOIA lawsuits that the Civil Division has handled (either pending or historical). Our chiefs suggested that you \nmight be able to help us generate that list — if you have any guidance or information on how we could track this down, \nwe'd really appreciate your help. Or if there's someone else we should reach out to in the Civil Division instead, please \nlet us know. \nThanks so much—\nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028848",
