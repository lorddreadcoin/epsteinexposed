I still need to write my section, and I'm \ndoing some significant revisions to the Loftus section, but the Dietz section is done —Mil crushed it. That's the bulk of \nthe motion, so feel free to read that over, and I'll send you the rest in a second round later. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00018896",
