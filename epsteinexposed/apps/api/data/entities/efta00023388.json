For earlier issues in the case, I think we \nwent up to the GC. I can confirm with the FOIA Specialist I've primarily been working with there how far it has gone \nthis time. (She is in Central Office, not MCC.) I know she went up with one specific issue recently about the production, \nso I assume folks there no the whole thing is going out. \nEFTA00023388\n\nI have not been in touch with the Estate at any point, and see no reason to do that. If we were going to reach out to \nthem, I'd like to clear that with folks on the Civil side. \nI've been in touch with at OIG (told him about the extension today). \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Thursday, June 24, 2021 12:18 PM \nTo: (USANYS) < (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Noel/Thomas FOIA Disclosure \nDefer to on this. But to the extent it is relevant, on Noel/Thomas's counsel, they know about the FOIA litigation \nbecause we produced some materials to them that were collected after the FOIA action was initiated, so I could easily \ngive them a  call or email on this. The Noel/Thomas team hasn't been giving any updates to the Estate. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, June 24, 2021 12:16 PM \nTo: (USANYS) (usANys)::. \nCc: (USANYS)<> \nSubject: RE: Noel/Thomas FOIA Disclosure \nasked whether there was any other constituency that we should notify about the upcoming release that hasn't \nalready been notified (she suggested BOP or Epstein's estate). how high up BOP have you been briefing about \nthis?
