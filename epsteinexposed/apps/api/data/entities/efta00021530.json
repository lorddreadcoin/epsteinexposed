Our clients believe they were assaulted \nEFTA00021530\n\nby Epstein in or around June 2004. Our clients did not consent or agree to any sexual touching \nor activity with Mr. Epstein. Our clients are also concerned, after learning about the pictures \nrecovered from Mr. Epstein's home, that sexually explicit pictures were unknowingly taken of \nthem during the incidents. \nOur clients' names are r'lease \nbe advised, our clients wish to remain anonymous at this juncture and do not consent to their \nnames being released to the public. Please advise immediately if it appears as if our clients' \nidentities will be released to the public and/or Mr. Epstein's legal team. If revealing the identities \nis necessary for the case to move forward, please advise prior to doing so, so that our clients \ncan make an informed decision. \nWe understand your office may be interested in interviewing our clients for additional details. We \ncan help coordinate a time for you to interview our clients in New York. \nPlease let us know if you need any additional information at this time; otherwise, we look \nforward to hearing from you soon. \nBest, \nColleen \nColleen M. Mullen, Esq. \nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged, proprietary, or \notherwise private information.
