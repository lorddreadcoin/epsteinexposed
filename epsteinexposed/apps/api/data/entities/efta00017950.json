Due to the transition of personnel at the \nMCC there has been some miscommunication between the MCC, the FBI, and the video surveillance vendor \nNice \nVision. After speaking with \nNYO \nEM and then talking with , the following is the plan to extract all \nrelevant video surveillance from the MCC, which also allows for the MCC to maintain a video surveillance system for \nsecurity purposes. \nAs a quick background, the MCC has two (2) DVR surveillance systems which provide coverage for the entirety of \nEFTA00017950\n\nthe facility. Each system, DVR system #1 and DVR system #2, contain sixteen (16) hard drives which recorded the \nactivity captured by the associated cameras. According to MCC staff, on 07/29/19, DVR system #2 had two to three \nhard drives fail causing most of that system to stop recording. Two of the three camera feeds of obvious interest \nresided on DVR system #2, meaning they were not recording at the time of the suicide on 08/10/19. Long before the \nhard drive failures and the suicide of the subject, the MCC had contracted with NiceVision to replace the antiquated \nsystem being utilized by the facility. NiceVision arrived at the MCC on Monday 08/12/19 to begin work on the \ninstallation. NiceVision has not completed the work on the system because they have not had access to the equipment \nroom since FAVU arrived later that same day to export video from a camera feed on the working DVR system #1. \nAfter consultation with NYO CART and OTD, it has been determined the best chance for the FBI to extract and \nreview video surveillance footage is to remove DVR system #2 immediately. \nThis system is currently being extracted with the permission of MCC Acting Warden A member of NY \nCART will transport this system down to OTD today where a team from DFAS-DSAU will be waiting to receive and \nattempt a rebuild of the failed hard drives. This will be necessary in order for us to reconstitute the system later when \nwe receive DVR system #1 at OTD. \nAnother team from FBI FAVU is currently on-site working on exporting video from the third camera of interest \nconnected to DVR system #1, which is currently operational and being utilized by the MCC. We will continue to \nexport video from this camera back through at least 07/23/19, the date of the first alleged suicide attempt. Review has \nbegun on this camera by C-19 and SDNY. At the same time C-19 will maintain a 24-7 presence in the equipment \nroom to ensure integrity of the system and to also allow access for simultaneous work by NiceVision to complete the \ninstall of the new video surveillance system. NiceVision is currently once again working on the install and estimated a \ncompletion of the work as early as tomorrow (8/15/19). Once the new system is operational and FAVU has completed \nthe download from the one known camera of interest residing on DVR system #1, we will collect it and send that \ndown to OTD. We anticipate we could send down DVR system #1 down within the next two days. This will \npotentially allow us to reconstitute both systems down at OTD where we can determine what video is present. Then \nwe will review the entirety of the recorded video surveillance for evidentiary purposes. \nIt should be noted that the 30 day over-write in these systems were suspended for DVR system #1 and DVR system \n#2 on 08/12/19 and 08/10/19, respectively. Also of note, beside the attempt to rebuild the failed hard drives, there is a \nsignificant chance the hard drives pulled from DVR #2 on 08/10/19, are corrupted and/or encrypted since they were \nextracted while the system was running. We will know more about this issue once we can reconstitute the system and \nreview. It is estimated the work described in this communication may take several weeks to complete. After all efforts \nhave been made the possibility exists the rebuild of the hard drives and reconstitution of the systems may ultimately \nfail to produce the desired outcome. \n■ \nEFTA00017951",
