I believe we \nwill be uploading NYC024318 1871 (iPhone) to this drive (and I've noted the tentative bates number for that on the index, \nattached here and updated on the shared, and in the cover letter, attached) — but other than that, we are all set. \nI've attached a (very basic) cover letter for defense, for your review and relevant additions. Since we are reproducing so \nmuch to MDC, I also created a unique index for the MDC drive on the shared index. I can attach that chart to defense's \ncover letter when it goes out, if that would be helpful, or I can just keep the MDC index section for our internal \norganization. \nis still working on copying the MDC drive. Hopefully we'll have an update soon. I'm happy to make any changes \nwithin the cover letter and/or index as necessary. Thank you all! \nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office SDNY \nEFTA00030562",
