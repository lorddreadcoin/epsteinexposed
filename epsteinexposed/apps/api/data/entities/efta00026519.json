Please find language below that has been approved by FBI NY, VSD \nexecutive management and our OGC rep. I'm more than happy to have a call if you would like to discuss. \nThe FBI's Victim Services Division (VSD) is committed to providing services and support to victims of crimes \ncommitted by Jeffrey Epstein. Though this particular indictment is focused on specific individuals, you are still \nentitled to your rights, resources, and referrals as a federal victim independent of this indictment. An \noverview of these services is available at www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services.  If you would like to speak \nwith a Victim Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights to victim services and referrals, \nplease email victimservices@fbi.gov.\nThank you, \nProgram Manager \nFBI Victim Services Division \n<contact list only 31E-NY-3027571 6.26.2020.xlsx> \nEFTA00026520",
