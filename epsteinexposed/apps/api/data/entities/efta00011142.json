\nEFTA00011142\n\n•  Everdell: could only use for purposes of bail application; would not publicly disseminate or disclose; would only be \nshared with prosecution team; individuals looking to come forward are nervous b/c of notoriety of the case; want \nto give comfort that what telling at meeting will be treated confidentiality and won't be disclosed \n• in evaluating potential bail application, for financial information, might contact bank or vet that information; \nsometimes take steps to vet cosigners as well; would restrictions prohibit us from doing that \n•  Everdell: for purposes of meeting, want to describe potential co-signers and what security of bond would look like \nand discuss certain financial information (most financial information are things already in discovery itself, so some \nof materials already marked confidential); understand will need to vet co-signers \n•  Cohen: keep confidential for Monday's purposes and then to extent team needs to vet people, we can work through \nthat \n• in terms of conditions of confinement, still trying to understand everything that has happened in last 24 \nhours; \no Understand that one of staff members on detail who works in area where client is housed tested positive for \nCOVID; understand that everyone who works in that area was sent home to quarantine; rapid test came \nback negative; sending lab test out; will need to stay in quarantine for 14 days, will test out; during that \ntime she needs to stay in isolation cell; was not aware that searching her the way you described while in \nquarantine; will reach out to MDC and discuss balancing need for security with disease \no Understanding is she will still have 3 hours a day to make legal calls; have made request to MDC legal that is \ngoing up to warden that she be able to review laptop for 13 hours that she was supposed to be in the day \nroom; will inquire about a writing surface, whether possible to put something into her cell to make review \nof discovery more practical or move her to somewhere with that kind of furniture; understand that \ntemperate is ; understand no issues with moistness \n•  Sternheim: anytime anything is given to her, open hatch; every time it is opened and closed it is sprayed; chemical of \nspray goes into the room where there is no other ventilation; she also has no hot water, soap; not able to self-\nprotect under the conditions \n• MI: will focus on the conditions while she will be in quarantine \n•  Sternheim: legal calls being done in close proximity to people who are watching her; I could hear people when I was \non call with them; was told notetaking was occurring; she is in between 1 to 4 feet distance from these people \n• MI: will follow up \n•  Everdell: CD that sent with most recent production, can't review that on laptop \n• MI: if want us to load hard drive with just that, can do that; or wait until have hard drive loaded \n•  Everdell: will get back to you \n• concerns that expressed before quarantine are mostly on level of searches and surveillance \n•  Sternheim: she is practically in solitary confinement; when I visit her, there are at least 3 people watching us with a \ncamera; I have asked what camera is for; they say it is not recording; then why is it always set up and moved when \nthey moved us; degree of invasiveness of attorney-client relationship which have not experienced before; she \ndoesn't even have a regular toothbrush; it's one inch \n•  Cohen: have had same experience with camera; when allowed to see her, not allowed to pass her documents \n• \nU: \nhave had multiple conversations with MDC about that \n•  Sternheim: in most recent visit, was able to hand her something to look at; have put us in a room that's very tight; \nnever seen anything like this \n• \nU: \nclient has more access to discovery and more time to review discovery than any other inmate; more time for \ncalls as well \n•  Sternheim: that may be true; however, whatever is being done to her to prevent what had happened to Epstein, she \nis being worn down; mentally healthy person; her hair is falling out \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00011143\n\nTe \nEFTA00011144",
