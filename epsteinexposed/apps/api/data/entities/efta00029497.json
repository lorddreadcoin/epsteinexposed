In the process of doing so, approximately 140 of those emails were duplicated. Today, I deleted the \nduplicate version of those emails, taking care to ensure that one copy of each email remains in that folder, consistent with \nthe litigation hold in this case. \nFrom: USANYS-IT Services \nSent: Friday, October 09, 2020 19:49 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: RE: Outlook question \nDo not believe there is a de-dupe option. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 9, 2020 7:43 PM \nTo: USANYS-IT Services \nSubject: RE: Outlook question \nSorry for the bother, but I copied a number of emails into a new Outlook folder and it somehow appears to have doubled \nevery single email. Is there a way to update / de-dupe that? Or do I need to individually delete every other email to get it \nback to normal??
