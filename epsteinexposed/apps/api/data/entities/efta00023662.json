Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan, \nIn accordance with this Court's Order of August 18, 2020 (Doc. 44), Ms. Maxwell hereby \nrespectfully submits under seal her proposed redactions to her Request to Modify Protective \nOrder (\"Request\"), filed under seal on August 17, 2020. Ms. Maxwell also has filed her Reply \nunder seal and contemporaneously submits her proposed redactions to that pleading.' \nMs. Maxwell has no opposition to keeping under seal, and redacting from her Request and \nReply, the contents, description and discussion of the sealed materials themselves; because the \ngovernment has marked them Confidential, the Protective Order requires as much. See Doc. 36, \n1 15. \nThe government's proposed redactions, however, go further and propose to redact significant \nprocedural background, all of which is publicly available information. The government would \nhave this Court redact the \"snectttc civil suit Nom which the eovernment obtained matenals - \nv. Maxwell lit ahon1 \ngovernment's investigation.\" \non the premise that it would \"risk jeopardizing the \np iIMs. Maxwell has already publicly and repeatedly pointed out in the case, and to they \n!second Circuit, that which was obvious from the outset of this crimi c, -- that her sealer \nI  To the extent this Court believes this letter also should be filed publicly, counsel also has indicated her proposed \nredactions to this letter. \nEFTA00023662\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

'here is no reference in the sea e4 \nImatena s to any con 'denial m ormant, wiretap, or other actua ongoing investigative procesi \n'that might be compromised by disc osure o the matena 4 The process to evaluate whether a \njudicial document should remain under seal is clear. Once a determination is made that the \nmaterials are judicial documents the Court is required to determine whether any countervailing \ninterests outweigh the presumptive right to public access. M. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49-50 \n(2d Cir. \n2019). \nFrankly, Ms. Maxwell does not believe that the government has established a countervailing \ninterest compelling enough to justify continued sealing of the documents. \nConsideration the on y reason that the documents are sea ed is because the government' \n(Circumvented the process estab 'shed m Martmde   It is also likely that these same documents \nwill be the subject of future motion practice in this Court, 'making the matena ,   or the third time \nluck= documents \niw\nib7r \nHowever, Ms. Maxwell has no interest in additional pretrial publicity related to any of these \ndocuments and submits that protecting her right to a fair trial is the countervailing interest that, \nat this point, requires her proposed redactions and the continued sealing of the materials with the \nexception of her limited request to file the materials under seal \nlAppea s and udge l'reska \n'with the Second Circuit Court oil \n2 \"These charges to be announced today, are the latest result of our investigation into Epstein, and the people \naround him who facilitated his abuse of minor victims.
