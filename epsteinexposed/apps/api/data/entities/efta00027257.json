It was an extraordinary and memorable day made possible by our fabulous team. Geoff \nFrom: (USANYS) 4 \nSent: Tuesday, August 27, 2019 7:07 PM \nTo: Berman, Geoffrey (USANYS) \nSubject: Epstein \nGeoff and \n(USANYS) < \n> \nJust wanted you both to know that we've been receiving a positive response from NGOs on the Epstein case — not just in \nterms of the charges brought, but also in terms of the opportunity created for victims to be heard. I was in court for part \nof today, and I'm not sure that I've experienced anything like it. I am very proud of the way that our Office has handled \nthis case and investigation, and I hope that it encourages more victims to come forward. \nThank you. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00027257",
