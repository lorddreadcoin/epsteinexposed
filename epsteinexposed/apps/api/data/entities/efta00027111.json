Thanks. \nFrom: \nI  < \nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:45 PM \nTo: (USANYS) < (USANYS)\nSubject: FW: US v Epstein \nFYI, among several other recent requests and communications, Epstein's defense counsel says below that they would \n\"welcome a call\" with whoever is conducting the investigation into his death and have asked us to provide you with their \ncontact information. Obviously leave it entirely to you whether you believe it would be appropriate or useful for your \ninvestigation to be in touch with them in any capacity. \nSeparately, they have asked us to advise the individuals working on the investigation into Epstein's death that his brother, \nMark Epstein, is represented by Stacey Richman, from the Law Offices of Murray Richman. Should you find it appropriate \nor useful for the investigation to be in touch with her (or him through her), it appears that the number of her and her \nfather's firm is \nFrom: Martin G.

You have agreed to that protocol for the phones seized from Mr. Epstein on July 6 and the computers etc \nseized from his NYC residence shortly thereafter. I have a list of attorneys that I am prepared to send to a taint prosecutor \nonce one is identified to me. \nSecond, there remains the timing of the dismissal of the charge against Mr. Epstein. Are you awaiting a motion to dismiss \nfrom us? Will the Indictment be nolle prossed today? Is there a reason for any delay beyond today? \nThird, we would welcome a call with you or whoever is conducting the investigation into Mr. Epstein's death. Let us know. \nMarty \nMartin G.
