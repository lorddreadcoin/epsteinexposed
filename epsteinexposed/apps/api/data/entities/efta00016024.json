Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (A.JN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nmotion for bail. \nsubmits the following statement in opposition to the Defendant's renewed \n*** \nI  appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more \nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of \nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine \nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure \nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she \nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her \nposition of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would \nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior. \nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has \nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children \nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has \ndemonstrated a  complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and \ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse. \nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with \nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including \nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a  parasitic lifestyle \nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence. \nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and \nthat she is willing to harm others if it  benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She \nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially \nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. \nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued \nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last \nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more \nBOIES SCHILLER \nFLEXNER LLP \n401 Eost Los Otos Boulevard.

Even more concerning, is if she is let out she has the ability \nto once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a lifetime. \nI  implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her \nincarcerated until her trial. \n*** \nRespectfully submitted, \nEFTA00016025",
