    "text": "\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nx \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \nv. \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nDefendant. \nx \n20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nREPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MS. MAXWELL'S MOTION TO \nDISMISS \nCOUNTS ONE THROUGH SIX OF THE SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT FOR \nPRE-INDICTMENT DELAY \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nLaura A. Menninger \nHADDON, MORGAN & FOREMAN P.C. \nChristian R. Everdell \nCOHEN \n& GRESSER LLP \nBobbi C. Stemheim \nLaw \nOffices of Bobbi C. Stemheim \nAttorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell \nEFTA00028963\n\nThe significant delay in prosecuting these charges has substantially prejudiced Ms. \nMaxwell, and the government has offered no legitimate reason for the tactical delay. Indeed, \nmany of the arguments made by the government in response to Ms. Maxwell's motions reveal \nnew information that undercut its claims about the origins of, and motives behind, this \nprosecution. \nMs. Maxwell raised this issue pretrial, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P 12(b)(3)(A)(ii). In \nher opening memorandum Ms. Maxwell noted that significant discovery related to the \nallegations had not yet been provided by the government, that her investigation is ongoing, and \nrequested that the Court defer ruling on this motion. \nThe government's responses to Ms. Maxwell's motions, including its response to this \nmotion, underscore the legitimacy of Ms. Maxwell's continued request that the Court hold this \nissue open. As reflected in the various pleadings, the government did have communications with \nlawyers for civil litigants and did have information about the allegations made in the indictment \nwell before it claims the investigation was opened. Ms. Maxwell learned about these things only \nbecause the government felt the need to make partial disclosures in an attempt to defend its \nactions. \nIn its response to the instant motion, the government, without actually disclosing the \nwitness's statements, selectively \"proffers\" \"facts\" to justify its position but tells Ms. Maxwell \nand the Court that we should, apparently, just trust the government because \"the underlying \ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 302 reports of interviews with the victims, will be \nproduced to the defense as 3500 material in advance of trial.\" Resp. at 55 fn. 21. \nAs discussed in her Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Specificity, for a Bill of Particulars, \nand for Pretrial Disclosures, the government's failure to provide adequate information about the \nEFTA00028964\n\nallegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell's ability to investigate and \ndefend this matter. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information \nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when \nconvenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See, \ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (1975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285 (2d \nCir. 1991); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 182-84 (2d Cir.2000); Granite \nPartners, L.P. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Worthington v. \nEndee, 177 F.R.D. 113, 116-17 (N.D.N.Y. 1998); Peck v. United States, 514 F. Supp. 210, 213 \n(S.D.N.Y.), on reargument, 522 F. Supp. 245 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); State of N. D. ex reL Olson v. \nAndrus, 581 F.2d 177, 182 (8th Cir. 1978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the government in \nthis action is \"intolerable as a matter of policy\"). \nIt would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to continue to litigate this issue \npiecemeal. Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely \nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial \ndelay. \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to \nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pit-Indictment Delay until \nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this matter, including, but not limited \nto any alleged F.R.E. 404(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio \nmaterial. \nDated: March 15, 2021 \n2 \nEFTA00028965\n\nRespectfully submitted, \ns/ Jeffrey S.
