Do you mind letting me know if you get more inquiries on this, including from other outlets? \n(Bloomberg has been contacting me, and I've been ignoring.) \nOn Feb 11, 2021, at 8:34 AM, \nI meant I *won't share further! \nExcited for you, and good \nluck!! \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Feb 11, 2021, at 8:32 AM, \nThanks, I appreciate it. \n(USANYS) < > wrote: \nOn Feb 11, 2021, at 8:28 AM, \n(USANYS) 6 < \n> \nwrote: \n(USANYS) <1 \n> \nwrote: \nI obviously include this in clips or share further. \nJust thought you'd want to see this if you already hadn't. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFt \nTt \nci\nC \nSubject: Law360 \n3 Names To Watch \nAs Biden Mulls Next SDNY Top \nProsecutor \nBy Pete \nBrush \nSent from my iPhone \nEFTA00032872\n\nShare us on: \nLaw360, New York (February 10, 2021, 5:41 \nPM EST) -- President Joe Biden is ramping \nup the process of choosing new top federal \nprosecutors across the country, and while he \nmay not rush to replace Manhattan U.S. \nAttorney Audrey Strauss, lawyers have their \neye on a handful of her potential successors. \nThe application process to helm the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of \nNew York, a process that court-watchers say \nis active and includes a large pool of \ncandidates, comes as the Biden \nadministration begins the work of replacing \nU.S. attorneys appointed by former President \nDonald Trump, who have all been asked to \nstep down. \nBut the president may not hurry to replace \nStrauss, who in December was formally \nappointed as U.S. attorney by federal judges \namid the chaos of the outgoing Trump \nadministration. \nStrauss, who of late has brought high-profile \ncases including sex-abuse charges against \nJeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine \nMaxwelland ex-fashion executive Peter \nNygard, is well-regarded, and her presence \nleaves the White House the luxury of taking \nits time on SDNY if it wishes to prioritize \ndozens of other districts across the country. \n\"She has a stellar reputation inside and \noutside the office,\" Pace Law School \nprofessor Bennett L. Gershman said of \nEFTA00032873\n\nStrauss. \nNevertheless the application process is \nunderway in the Southern District, sources \nsaid, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck \nSchumer, D-N.Y., holding powerful sway over \nthe process. Asked to handicap top possible \nsuccessors, lawyers named three people: \nDamian \nWilliams is a veteran SDNY \nprosecutor who heads the district's Securities \nand Commodities Fraud Task Force. He \nprosecuted former politicians Sheldon Silver \nand Chris Collins in recent years, and is \nwidely regarded as a steadying presence \ninside the halls at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza. \nWilliams, who would be the first Black person \nto head the office, is a former law clerk for \nD.C. Circuit Judge Merrick B. Garland, \nBiden's nominee for attorney general who is \nslated for a Feb. 22 confirmation hearing in \nthe Senate. \nThe Garland clerk chain, dozens strong, \ncould be fertile ground for possible picks, \nlawyers said, on the theory that a pre-existing \nrelationship with the man who likely will lead \nBiden's Department of Justice could be \nvaluable. \nKatherine Goldstein \nA white collar partner at Akin Gump Strauss \nHauer & Feld LLP, Katherine Goldstein is a \nformer SDNY Securities and Commodities \nEFTA00032874\n\nFraud Task Force chief with a sharp legal \nmindwho has worked on modernizing and \nimproving insider trading enforcement. She \nhas handled a number of high-profile white \ncollar fraud cases. \nAfter Strauss and Mary Jo White, who held \nthe post from 1993 until 2002, Goldstein \nwould be the third woman to take the job in its \nmore-than 200 year history, if confirmed. \nAnjan Sahni \nLike Williams and Goldstein, Anjan Sahni, a \nWilmerHale white collar partner, is a former \nSDNY Securities and Commodities Fraud \nTask Force chief. \nSahni, who is of South Asian descent, also is \nnoted for his work on a defense team \nthat won acquittal for Citigroup trader Rohan \nRamchandani in a closely-watched forex-\nrigging criminal trial. \nWilliams, Goldstein and Sahni are all said to \nbe friendly with, and have professional ties to, \nformer Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet \nBharara, who was fired by the Trump \nadministration in 2017. Sources said Bharara \nhas a direct line to Schumer as the \napplication process unfolds. \n--Editing by Jill Coffey. \nEFTA00032875",
