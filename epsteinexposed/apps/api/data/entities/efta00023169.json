And just as a heads up, not that I particularly expect this will \nbe necessary, but similar to how we always tell witnesses that if they want to talk with their counsel privately during an in-\nperson meeting, we'll let her know that the same thing holds true for over the phone as well, that you two can always \nhave a side call at any point! And otherwise I think it will be the usual awkwardness of phone but hopefully not too bad. \nthanks again, \nFrom: Sigrid McCawley < \nSent: Friday, May 08, 2020 14:46 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: follow-up request \nIf that does not work she also said she could do it this Monday morning — 10:00 Eastern (9:00 Texas) if that is better for \nyour team. \nJust let me know. \nThanks \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nwww.bsfllp.com\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 8, 2020 1:59 PM \nTo: Sigrid McCawley \nCc: \nSubject: RE: follow-up request \n) \n[mailto \nCAUTION: External email.
