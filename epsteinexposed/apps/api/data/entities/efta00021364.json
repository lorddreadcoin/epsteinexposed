I have left in one of his comments for your reaction. I just made it double-\nspaced and it is quite long, so as you are reviewing, any thoughts on where to cut would be much appreciated. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, February 15, 2021 11:41 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Maxwell Suppression Opp \nThanks! I should be able to look at this tomorrow evening, so let me know if MI has reviewed before then. Otherwise, \nI'll look at this draft. \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Monday, February 15, 2021 1:51 PM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: Maxwell Suppression Opp \nHey — Hope you have been able to enjoy the long weekend! Here is what I sent M. I don't think he has reviewed yet \nand not sure what your timing is looking like, but figured I would forward. (Also happy to send to you once MI has had a \nchance to review) \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Friday, February 12, 2021 4:25 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Maxwell Suppression Opp \nThanks so much, M. My apologies again for its length. I welcome all of your feedback, including where to trim this; if \nthe order in which I addressed her various arguments makes sense; and the due process points. Hopefully I didn't miss \nthe mark too badly on this! Thanks again. \nFrom: (USANYS)\nSent: Friday, February 12, 2021 2:06 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Maxwell Suppression Opp \nSure. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Friday, February 12, 2021 2:05 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: Maxwell Suppression Opp \nEFTA00021364\n\nThanks again for all of your time over the past couple of weeks. I was hoping to send you my Maxwell opposition this \nafternoon for your review given all of your incredibly helpful feedback and expertise in this area. It's on the lengthier side \ngiven the complicated facts and the many arguments they made so my apologies in advance. I'm aiming to send it to my \nchiefs early next week if at all possible, but totally understand if not.
