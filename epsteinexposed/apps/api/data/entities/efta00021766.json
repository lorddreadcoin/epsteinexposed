We will follow up with \nAs for the cell phone, we had discussed agreeing or attempting to agree on the process for such a review. Can you have \nthe taint team reach out to us before they begin their review? \nIt is our understanding that there were hand held videos used to film the inside or the cell on the night of the 23rd of July. \nI understand your email, but in light of the inconsistent accounts of the surveillance video can you please make further \ninquiries on this specific point? \nLastly, we are going to request a hearing on what happened to the surveillance video. Please let us know what your \nposition on that request. \nBruce A. Barket, Esq. \nBarket Epstein Kearon Aldea & LoTurco, LLP \n666 Old Country Road , Ste. 700 \nGarden City, NY 11530 \nwww.barketepstein.com \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.

You will not be allowed to take photographs of the rope. \n2 —  We have been informed that in the course of its investigation into Mr. Tartaglione's contraband cellphone, BOP created \nforensic reports of the phone and SIM card. We have not obtained or requested copies of these reports. If you would like \nto review the reports, please let us know. In that case, in light of earlier claims of privilege raised by Mr. Barket, we will \nEFTA00021766\n\nask BOP to provide the reports to a walled off team of AUSAs to review for privileged materials. That walled off team of \nAUSAs will coordinate producing the reports to you and will work with you to determine what, if any, portions of the \nreport can be provided to the case AUSAs \n3 —  We have been informed by BOP that apart from the photographs contained in the materials you reviewed at our office \nregarding the July 23 incident, no other pictures or videos were taken from inside the Tartaglione/Epstein cell. \n4 —  We have received additional information from BOP regarding the video outside of the Tartaglione/Epstein cell, and we \nwill be filing a letter with the Court shortly. As stated in the letter, the video that we have is available for review at our \noffice at your convenience. \nEFTA00021767",
