On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL \nTHOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as \ncorrectional officers \nat  the Metropolitan Correctional Center \n(\"MCC\"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated \ncounts of prisoners \nunder their watch in  the \nMCC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\"). \nInstead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS \nsat at their desk, \nbrowsed the internet, and moved around the \ncommon area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their \nduties, NOEL and THOMAS \nrepeatedly signed false \ncertifications \nattesting \nto having conducted \nmultiple counts of inmates when, \nin \ntruth and in \nfact, they never conducted such counts. As a result \nof those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU \nwere being regularly monitored and accounted \nfor when, in fact, as \na  result of the defendants' conduct, no  correctional \nofficer \nconducted any count or round of \nthe SHU from approximately 10:30 \nEFTA00009747\n\nCase \n1:19-cr-00830-AT \nDocument \n1 \nFiled \n11/19/19 \nPage \n2 \nof \n20 \np.m. \non
