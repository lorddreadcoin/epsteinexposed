It represents \nall the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get \nadditional information we will pass it along immediately. \nSeparately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are \naccurate, and I fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. \nAs always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful. \nthank you, \nEFTA00019950",
