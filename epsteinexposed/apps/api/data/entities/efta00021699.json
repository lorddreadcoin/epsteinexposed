Given the \nvolume of materials seized, we anticipate that the evidence view may take more than one eight \n(8) hour session to complete and we ask that you plan accordingly. We request that Ms. \nMaxwell be present and able to participate in that evidence view. \nIf you have a log of all evidence seized in connection with this case, we ask that you provide \nit to us in advance of the evidence-view so that we may bring the appropriate equipment to \ndocument the items as necessary. \nWith regard to the scene visits, we are open to discussing dates and times for those to occur \nover the next month. Please contact me with your proposal. We will need to make \nappropriate travel arrangements. \nEFTA00021699\n\nMs. \nComey, Moe and Pomerantz \nMarch 6, 2021 \nPage 2 \nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. \nRespectfully submitted, \nCC: Counsel of \nRecord via Email \n11-67Laura A.
