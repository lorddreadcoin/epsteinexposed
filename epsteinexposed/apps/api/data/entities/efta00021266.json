Depending on what we learn at Monday's \nbriefing, we may have some work to do to deal with this drone exercise (although if Eric's information is correct, it really \nshould be an inconvenience but not something that requires radical adjustments.) \nTrials Continuing: \n• \nAhuja \nMonday, July 1 \n• First Day for AUSAs \n• Swearing —in ceremony — 12 p.m. \n• Matos verdict report —  2 p.m. \n• Sarcone briefing re: drones —  3 p.m. \nTuesday, July 2 \n(SCFU). Securities mismarking at Premum Point Investments. Judge Failla. \n• AUSA interviews \n• Geragos meeting —  2 p.m. \n• Epstein indictment (PC) \n• Ernesto Lopez sentencing (Narc). Dr. Lopez was convicted after trial of illegally dispensing oxycodone and \nfentanyl. Judge Cote. \nWednesday, July 3 \n• VOC pipeline meeting —10 a.m. \n• Narcotics pipeline meeting —12 p.m. \nThursday, July 4 \nEFTA00021266\n\nrN \nFriday  July 5 \nOther \n• I am contemplating who should take 'lace in organizing the trial training program (with Karl) \nthat all new AUSAs do, and welcome any thoughts in that regard. This is not time sensitive, but better to think \nabout it ahead of time. \nChief, Criminal Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office, SDNY \nEFTA00021267",
