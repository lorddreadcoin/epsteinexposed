    "text": "\n\nH. DORN WILLIAMS JR. \nAttorney at Law \nOver 45 Years' Experience \nMartindale-Hubbell \"AV\" Rated \nTrials & Appeals. State & Federal Courts \nJuly 19, 2019 \nU.S. \nAttorney's Office \nRe: USA v. \nJeffrey Epstein \nDear \nThe bullet \nEpstein dodged that no one is talking about. He did so because of \nthe combined \nactions of former U.S. \nAttorney Alexander Acosta, former Palm Beach County State Attorney \nBarry Krischer, the Palm Beach County \nSheriffs Office, and the assistant state attorney(s) that \nhandled Jeffrey Epstein's criminal \npr9secution in state court. \nAt his plea and \nsentencing, the judge asked why Epstein was going to \nserve his sentence in \nthe Palm Beach County stockade instead of in a \nFlorida state prison, like most sex offenders. \nThe response was we just \ndecided that was the best way to accomplish \nwhat needed to be \ndone here and agreed that the \nsentence satisfied everyone's requirements. \nHis carefully \nconstructed plea and \nsentence accomplished Epstein \navoiding the Jimmy Ryce \nAct, \nrelating to the indefinite civil commitment \nof sexual predators. If he \nhad been eligible for \nJimmy Ryce commitment, there is a \nsubstantial likelihood that he would have been \nindefinitely \ncommitted and \nwarehoused with other sexual \npredators. \nEpstein was charged with two felony \noffenses: (1) procuring a person \nunder the age of 18 for \nprostitution, a \nsecond-degree felony, punishable by \n15 years in prison, and (2) \nfelony \nsolicitation of \nprostitution, a third-degree \nfelony, punishable by 5 years in \nprison. He was facing \na \nmaximum consecutive \nsentence of 20 years in \nprison. \nFlorida, like the \nFederal Courts, has sentencing \nguidelines. Epstein's \nguidelines calculated the \n\"lowest \npermissible prison sentence of \n21.5 months,\" or \nalmost two years in state \nprison. In \nFlorida, the \ncourt can go below \nthe lowest permissible \nrange via a  motion for \ndownward \ndeparture, or plea \nbargain. Epstein avoided a \n21.5-month prison \nsystem via plea bargain. \nEFTA00014615\n\nTo understand how he avoided the Jimmy \nRyce Act, you need to look at his carefully \nconstructed sentence. According to the plea sheet he signed, \nregarding his conviction for felony \nsolicitation of prostitution, he was sentenced to 12 \nmonths in the county jail. Regarding is \nconviction for \nprocuring a person \nunder the age of 18 for \nprostitution, \na second-degree felony, \nhe was sentenced to 6 months county jail consecutive to the above 12-month sentence, and \nthat term of incarceration was to be followed 12 months community control. In other words, he \nwas sentenced to 18 months incarceration in the county jail. \nWhat if he had been sentenced to 18 months in prison, instead of the county jail? In 2008, the \nJimmy Ryce provided that to be eligible for indefinite civil commitment as a sexual predator the \nperson \nhad to be: \n.\n.'.serving a  sentence in the custody of the Department of Corrections, a \nperson who was adjudicated delinquent and is committed to the custody of the \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice, or a person who was involuntarily committed \nto the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services upon an \nadjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity. §394.912(1), Fla. Stat. (2008). \nDefendants that might satisfy the definition of a  sexual predator were excluded  from \nconsideration if they were serving their time in a county Jail.  I have defended sex offenders and \nmen being prosecuted under \nthe Jimmy Ryce Act In 2005-2006, as an assistant public \ndefender, I defended about 25 men; being prosecuted under the Jimmy Ryce Act. I advised \nyoung public defenders to have sex crime offenders to take time in the county jail for this very \nreason. \nIn 2008, an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would have been aware of this county jail \nloophole.' If they say they were not aware \nof this loophole, they are incompetent or untruthful. \nIn 2014, this loophole was closed. The above \nsection was amended to include, \". . . a person \nwho is serving a \nsentence in a  county or municipal jail for a sexually violent \noffense. . .\" \n§394.912(1), Fla. Stat. (2014). Now, :a defendant \ncannot avoid the Jimmy Ryce Act by doing \nhis time in the county \njail, like Epstein. \nFor purposes of the Jimmy \nRyce \nAct \na \"sexually violent offense\" includes any criminal act that \nis subsequently determined to be pripven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt to have been \n\"sexually \nmotivated.\" A \"sexually motivatedi \ncrime is one whose purpose, in part, was for sexual \ngratification. Certainly, \nprostitution related offenses, and particularly with the facts \nof his case \nwere committed in part for \nsexual gratification. The misnomer is that violence does not \nhave \nto be an element of \nthe crime. \nIf Epstein had been in prison, instead of the \ncounty jail, the Department of Children and \nFamily's \nMultidisciplinary Team would have evaluated \nEpstein and submitted its written \nassessment \nand \nrecommendation to State Attorney \nBarry Krischer. Epstein would \nhave been back in the \nA  defense attorney cannot be \nfaulted for getting a  disposition \nthat avoids Jimmy Ryce \nconsequences, because his duty is \nto his client. \n2 \nEFTA00014616\n\nState Attorney's lap for the filing a  petition to seek his indefinite civil commitment. Once a \npetition is filed, the offender is held in custody at the Florida Civil Commitment Center. There \nis no bond/bail. \nHaving tired these cases, representing the defendant, the case is a battle of experts. The six-\nperson jury must unanimously \nfind by clear and convincing evidence whether the person \nhas the requisite prior conviction, has a \nmental abnormality affecting a  person's emotional \nor volitional capacity which predispopes the person to a \nsex offense, and is likely to engage \nin further sex crime to such a degreeas to pose a menace to the health and safety of others, \nunless he is indefinitely confined for treatment. \nThis potential \"rabbit \nhole\" was avoided simply by where Epstein was incarcerated. \nIn determining whether Epstein would \nsatisfy the criteria for the State Attorney to file a petition \nfor \ninvoluntary commitment, the psychologist/psychiatrist \nevaluators use a  diagnostic tool \nknown as Static-99. It is used throughout the United States and Canada. See the attached \nStatic-99 form. Plus, the evaluators can go behind the mere charges that he pled to. \nHaving a familiarity with Static-99 evaluation forms while representing men \nwho had petitions \nfiled against them, based on the Static\n-99, Epstein arguably qualified for the filing of a petition. \nI am not an \nexpert, but I rough calculated his score, using the score sheet applicable at the \ntime of his plea, as 4, \nwhich translates to a moderate to \nhigh risk of re-offending. \nIf Epstein was \nsentenced to state prison by the State Attorney Krischner, \nthere is a likelihood \nhe would have been back in front of that \nsame State Attorney for potential indefinite civil \ncommitment. Instead of \nrecently returning from France, Epstein might \nstill be at the facility in \nArcadia, Florida, with over 600 other sexual \npredators. Florida has more people committed \nthan \nany other state. \nThere are other anomalies in the \nhandling of this case. He was indicted for the \nfirst charge \n(2006CF9454). In the Federal system, \nfelony prosecution is initiated by Indictment, \nor the \nprosecutor and \nthe defense agree to the file of an \nInformation charging a specific crime(s). In \nFlorida, the \nonly crime that requires an Indictment is \nfirst-degree murder. In Florida, the State \nAttorney is referred to an a \n\"one-man grand jury because the \nState Attorney can with the stroke \nof a pen initiate a \ncriminal prosecution for any crime, other \nthan first-degree murder. Over 98% \nof crimes in \nFlorida are charged by Information filed by an \nassistant state attorney. \nAccording to The Miami Herald  \narticle, Detective Recarey also told \nThe Miami Herald that in \nMay 2006, he drew up \nprobable cause affidavits that charged \nEpstein and three associates \nwith a slew \nof sex crimes. But instead of \npushing forward with the case, \nKrischer referred the \ncase to \nthe grand jury, which returned \nan Indictment on a single \ncount of soliciting prostitution. \nIn Florida state \ncourt, the prosecutor frames the \ncharge it wants the grand \njury to consider and \nbrings an Indictment and the \napplicable law and instructions.2\nI would be \ncurious how many indictments in \nPalm Beach County in \n2005-2006 were returned \nfor crimes other than \nfirst-degree murder cases? \nHow many sex crimes \nprosecutions were \n2   As an \nassistant state attorney, I \npresented Indictments to the \ngrand jury. \n3 \nEFTA00014617\n\ninitiated by \nindictment? \nThese \nquestions a  federal prosecutor unfamiliar \nwith our state court \nsystem night not \nask. \nRegarding the first case, there are over 140 docket entries. A demand for discovery was never \nfiled. If it had been filed, the State Attorney would have to file an answer. Under Florida law, \nthe answer is a public record, as well as most of the documents produced in conjunction with \nthe \nanswer. This kept the facts out of the public eye.3\nRegarding the second case (2008CF009381). an Information was filed June 26, 2008. But the \nusual probable cause affidavit setting forth the facts of the crime was not filed.4  He plead \nguilty \nfour days later. Does the transcript of the plea colloquy set forth a  factual basis, or did he \nstipulate there was a factual \nbasis? \nIn summary, with no probable cause affidavit in either case, or demand for discovery the public \nhas no idea about the facts supporting the charges. Epstein was sex offender like my former \npublic defender clients. But money. powerful \nfriends, the U.S. Attorney, the Palm Beach State \nAttorney and Sheriffs Office agreed to an unusual \nsentence structure whereby Epstein avoided \npotential Jimmy Ryce Act \nindefinite \ncivil \ncommitment. Ask for proof that any other serial sex \noffender was sentenced to more than 365 days incarceration and was \npermitted to serve his \ntime in the \nPalm Beach \nCounty Jail I am not a \nhypocrite, as a \ncriminal \ndefense attorney. \nI too \nwould have \nsought to structure a sentence to avoid the Jimmy Ryce Act. \nThe defense obtained a spectacular outcome. But, the outcome was only possible because (1) \na  U.S. Attorney's Office was apparently afraid to try a  case that was less than a  slam \ndunk \nwinner, (2) a state court prosecutor was \napparently afraid to try a case that was less than a \nslam \ndunk winner, and (3) a  Sheriff who went along with the sentencing scheme. Ask the \nsheriff how many \ntimes he has honored this type of sentencing arrangement. \nSincerely \nyours, \nH. Dohn Wi lams Jr. \nCc: \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nU.S. \nAttorney's Office \nA defense attorney should not be faulted for this \ntactic; it protects his client. \nGo to the online court document number 4  It \nreads \"rough arrest no probable cause filed\" \nEFTA00014618",
