I have been out of office sick. \nWe are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC \nunits throughout the institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective bather for the equipment. \nWith that said, we will be doing test runs to investigate concerns you have mentioned. \nFurthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a \ndaily basis, which she has declined. \nAdditionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds you are requesting to bring into the \ninstitution? \nBest, \n>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM 6/16/2021 10:23 AM >» \nGood \nmorning-\nAs reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room are negatively impacting attorney-client \ncommunication. \nThe video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. \nI am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. \nAlso, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the \nguards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if Ms. Maxwell is \"off camera\" while leaning \nagainst a wall to soothe her aching back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing \nmachine and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as if any of this is funny. \nThe manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives me reason to be concerned about \nhow they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. \nThe courtesy of a response is requested. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nEFTA00032727\n\nBOBBI C.
