We need to discuss these documents with Ms. Maxwell on Tuesday 12/19, in order to comply \nwith a court-ordered filing deadline. We understand that legal calls are suspended on holidays (Monday, \n1/18, is Martin Luther King Day). \nTo ensure that Ms. Maxwell receives the documents on Friday for review over the weekend, we are \nrequesting permission to send them to the attention of the Legal Department for prompt delivery to Ms. \nMaxwell. \nPlease let me know if this is acceptable. \nIn addition, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be given access to the laptop \ncomputer provided by the government for use over the weekend. \nThe MDC computers are not capable of opening discovery documents provided by the government, \nwhich is why the laptop has been provided. Without access to a computer that allows her \nto review discovery, Ms. Maxwell is effectively denied the ability to assist in her defense. \nYour assistance is greatly appreciated. \nEFTA00024993\n\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
