McCawley, Esq. \nBoies Schiller Flexner LLP \n401 East Las Olas Boulevard \nSuite 1200 \nFort Lauderdale, FL 33301 \nRe: Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein \nDear Ms. McCawley: \ntroutmar7 \nsanders \nWe write in response to your letter dated November 22, 2019, posing two inquiries \nconcerning the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the \"Program\") presented by \nthe Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the \"Estate\") on November 14, 2019 to the \nSuperior Court of the United States Virgin Islands (the \"USVI Court\") for approval. Our \nresponse does not constitute the Co-Executors' position regarding discovery (e.g., whether \ndiscovery is appropriate at this time or the information you requested is discoverable in the \nactions pending in the Southern District of New York); rather, we respond in order to further the \nparties' discussions concerning the Program. \nAccordingly, we repeat your inquiries below and address them to the best of our ability \nbased on currently available information. \n1. \"What is the total value of Epstein's Estate?\" \nThe total assets held by the Estate are a matter of public record: the Co-Executors' \nPetition for Probate and for Letters Testamentary, filed on August 19, 2019 in the United States \nVirgin Islands, valued the Estate's assets in excess of $577 million. \nHowever, the Estate is subject to substantial potential liabilities in an undetermined \namount, which makes it impossible to accurately calculate the total value of the Estate. Among \nother things, (i) the Estate is subject to estate taxes in at least two jurisdictions, the United \nStates and France; (ii) the United States Department of Justice has indicated that it may seek \ncivil forfeiture of properties held by the Estate; and (iii) your clients and other claimants have \nlodged 17 separate lawsuits in New York state and federal courts, seeking multi-million-dollar \ndamages awards. Moreover, the number and size of future claims is unknown: one plaintiffs' \nEFTA00023230\n\nDecember 3. 2019 \nPage 2 \ntroutmariP \nsanders \ncounsel recently predicted that \"[p]otentially dozens\" more additional lawsuits will be filed, \nwithout specifying exact numbers of such cases or the damages that may be sought.' \nFor these reasons, it is simply not possible at present for the Co-Executors to state the \ntotal value of the Estate. However, if you and other plaintiffs' counsel provide us with a \ncomplete report on how many additional claims your clients intend to assert — as well as a \nrealistic assessment of damages to be sought in those claims — the Co-Executors can gain a \nbetter understanding of the Estate's potential liabilities. \n2. \"How much of Epstein's Estate will be set aside for compensating victims \nthrough the proposed claims resolution program?\" \nThe Co-Executors await approval of the Program by the USVI Court. In the interim, \nProgram Administrator Jordana Feldman and Program Designers Kenneth Feinberg and \nCamille Biros are proceeding with preparation of a detailed Program protocol to establish a fair, \nindependent claims resolution process as a voluntary alternative to protracted civil litigation. As \nwe understand it, the Program Administrator intends to reach out to your firm and other \nplaintiffs' counsel for input on the content of that protocol. \nOnce the Program protocol is finalized, the Co-Executors will submit it to the USVI Court \nfor approval and seek an order to formally commence claims resolution proceedings under the \nProgram. It remains to be seen how many claimants — your clients included — will decide to \nparticipate in the Program. When the number of participating claimants become clearer, the Co-\nExecutors anticipate being better able to estimate how much money will ultimately be required \nto adequately fund the Program. It is the Co-Executors' intent that the Program be \"open-\nended\" regarding amounts awarded — i.e., the Estate will not impose any absolute numerical \ncap on the Program's aggregate compensation payments. \n• • \nFor any other questions you or your clients may have about the proposed Program, we \nurge you to contact Ms. Feldman and her team as soon as possible. It is also in all parties' \ninterests for you to begin a constructive dialogue with Ms. Feldman and her team. We \nappreciate any assistance your firm and other plaintiffs' counsel can provide in enabling the \nProgram to serve its desired function as a preferred, confidential, non-adversarial alternative to \nlitigation, both for your clients and any other individuals seeking to resolve sexual abuse claims \nagainst Mr. Epstein or the Estate. \nSee November 21, 2019 transcript of proceedings held in Doe v. Epstein. et at. 19-CV-07675 (GBD) \n(S.D.N.Y.) and VE v. Nine East 71st Street et at, 19-CV-07625 (AJN) (S.D.N.Y.), at 38:7-14. \nEFTA00023231\n\nDecember 3. 2019 \nPage 3 \ntroutmarig \nsanders \nSincerely, \n/s/ \nBennet J. \nMoskowitz \nBennet J.
