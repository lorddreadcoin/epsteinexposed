Epstein hereby requests that the United States \nAttorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents \nthat any delay from the date of this Agreement to the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided \nfor in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and \nhe hereby waives any defense to such prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny \nhim rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the \nrunning of the statute of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing \nof this agreement and the breach of this agreement.
