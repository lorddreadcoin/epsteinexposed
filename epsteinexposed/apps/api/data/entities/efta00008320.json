Do some gentle warmups first, and then use more intense \nmaneuvers after the person is used to your touch. \n3 Be willing to be the first one to offer massage and to \ncontinue offering it \neven if the favor is not reciprocated for a while. \nMy father went to Emory \nUniversity Hospital \nonce for heart surgery, because his arteries \nwere blocked. The entire family was scared. \nMy mom and sister \nand I accompanied him, and \nwe watched as theywheeled him into the oper-\nating \nroom, which was filled with high-tech, \nexpensive equipment thatwe didn't understand. \nHours later, he came out okay, but the nurses \nhad to strap him to his hospital bed so he wouldn't \naccidentally roll over on the tubes and wires \nthat sprouted \nfrom his body. \nI \nstayed by his side all night, watching his pain \nand discomfort increase until he asked me to try \nto do \nsomething about it. \n\"Would you mind giving \nme a little massage, \nSon?\" he asked. \nI agreed, and then slid my hands along the hos-\npitatmattress under his-back until I could curl \nmyfingers up and work on his knotted muscles. \nThe operating table had been as hard as a block \nof concrete, and being strapped in \none position \nfor hours turned outto be the most painful part \nof \nthe.operation. \n\"You know, Steve; he said, his face just inches \nfrom mine, \"After whet I've been through, it feels \ngreat just to be alive. And what you're doing \nfeels indescribable.\" \nSo, every hour or so during the night, I awoke \nfrom sleep in the \nchair beside him, stretched my \nfingers beneath his back again, and offered the \nbest massage I  could. We didn't \nspeak many \nwords, but the father-son \ncommunication \nbetween us had never been stronger. It's an \nexperience that bonds us to this day. \nEFTA00008320\n\n \nChapter \n18: \nMassage \nfor \nthe \nWhole \nFamily \n273 \nSometimes, \nother \npeople \njust \nplain \naren't \ninto \nmassage. \nDon't \nforce \nyour \nfamily \nmembers \ninto \nit \nif \nthey're \nnot \ncomfortable. \nMore \ncommonly, \nthey'll \nbe \nready \nand \nwilling \nto \nexperiment \nwith \nmassage, \nbut \nonly \non \nthe \nreceiving \nend, \nleaving \nyou \nperpetually \nin \nthe \nrole \nof \ngiver. \nIf, \nno \nmatter \nwhat \ntactics \nyou \nuse, \nyou \nstill \nend \nup \nbeing \nthe \nonly \nperson \nin \nyour \nfamily \nwild \nand \ncrazy \nenough \nto \ngive \nmassages, \nI \nsay \ngo \nahead \nand \ndo \nRI \nYou'll \nbe \ncreating \na \ncloseness \nthat \nwouldn't \nbe \nthere \notherwise, \nand \nyour \nfamily \nwill \neventually \nexpress \ntheir \ngratitude \nin \nother \nways. \nBaby \nMassage \n\"Where \ntouching \nbegins, \nthere \nlove \nand \nhumanity \nalso \nbegin \n— \nwithin \nthe \nfirst \nminutes \nfollowing \nbirth.\" \n—Ashley \nMontagu \nMy \nwife \nand \nI \nwere \nwaiting \nin \nline \nat \nthe \ngrocery \nstore \none \nday \nwith \nour \nfour\n-\nmonth\n-old \nson \nsitting \nin \nhis \nstroller. \nSuddenly, \nthe \nwoman \nbehind \nus \nreached \nover \nand \nstarted \nmassaging \nhis \ntoes. \n\"Massage \nis \nvery \ngood \nfor \nbabies,\" \nshe \nsaid, \n\"especially \nhere \non \nthe \nbig \ntoe. \nIf \nhe's \ndepressed \nor \nangry, \nthis \nwill \nmake \nhim \nfeel \nbetter.\" \nWe \nwere \namazed, \nand \nit \nmust \nhave \nshown \non \nour \nfaces, \nbecause \nshe \nlooked \nup \nat \nus \nand \nsmiled \nreassuringly. \n\"Don't \nworry,\" \nshe \nsaid, \n\"It \nreally \nworks. \nI \nsaw \nIt \non \nTV!\" \nRegardless \nof \nhow \nyou \nfeel \nabout \nstrangers \ntouching \nyour \nchild's \nfeet \nin \nsupermarkets, \nthis \nstory \ndoes \npoint \nto \nthe \nwidespread \nacceptance \nof \nbaby \nmassage \nand \nchild \nmassage \nby \npeople \neverywhere. \nCultures \nfrom \naround \nthe \nworld \nembrace \nthe \nconcept \nof \nbaby \nmassage: \n3 \nPeople \nfrom \nIndia \nhave \nmassaged \ntheir \nbabies \nfor \ncenturies. \n3 \nEskimos \nand \nnative \npeople \nfrom \nEast \nAfrica \nhave \nlong \nhistories \nof \nusing \nbaby \nmassage, \ntoo. \n3 \nIn \nBali, \nchildren \nare \nheld \nin \nconstant \nphysical \ncontact \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nmonths \nof \nlife, \nand \nonly \nthen \nare \ntheir \nfeet \nfirst \nallowed \nto \ntouch \nthe \nground. \nTouch \nis \npart \nof \nthe \nfabric \nof \nlife, \nfrom \nthe \nmoment \nwe \nfirst \nemerge \nfrom \nthe \nwomb \ninto \nour \nparents' \narms. \nUnfortunately, \nthe \nmore \n\"civilized\" \nand \ntechno-\nlogically \nadvanced \nwe \nbecome, \nthe \nless \ntime \nwe \nseem \nto \nhave \nto \ntouch \nour \nbabies, \nand \nthat's \nwhy \nspending \nsome \nquality \ntime \nmassaging \nbabies \nis \nso \nimportant. \nEFTA00008321\n\n274 \nPart V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nWhy baby \nloves massage \nIf you spend a little time \naround babies, you may start to think to yourself, \n\"Hey, babies are different than normal \nhumans. They seem hyper-sensitive. \nEvery little touch is magnified a hundred times. Is It just me, or do babies feel \nthings differently than we do?\" \nBabies do indeed feel things more \nintensely than adults. This is caused by an \nabundance of special touch-sensing organs in the skin called Meissner's cor-\npuscles, which are five times more \nprevalent in children three years old and \nyounger \nthan they are in adults. Babies have 80 \nMeissner's corpuscles per \nsquare millimeter of skin \nversus 20 per square millimeter for adults and 4 per \nmillimeter for seniors. \nMeissner's corpuscles are especially good at \ndetecting light, fleeting movements \nacross the skin, and so this type of movement is especially effective on babies. \nAlso, researchers at the Touch Research \nInstitute (TRI) in Miami have found \nthat massage can actually help premature infants grow faster and \nleave the \nhospital \nsooner. Touch is a lifesaver for infants, who crave it as deeply as \nthey crave oxygen, or light. So, when you add to that the pleasure It \nprovides, \nit's no wonder babies love massage. \nBaby \nmassage moves \nOne thing about babies: They're \nreally, really small. You can tell how small \nthey are when you try to massage them and one of your \nhands covers their \nentire back. Besides, most of the time they're either squirming around like \ntadpoles.or lying fast asleep. So, what techniques are you supposed to \nuse on \nsuch tiny, wriggling creatures? \nHere are a few pointers to get you started: \nPo Choose a time when the baby is tranquil to give the massage, \nperhaps \nafter a bath, shortly after waking up, or right before bedtime. \npor Use light touch to stimulate the Meissner's corpuscles in your baby's \nskin, providing extra pleasure that makes him want to stay In one place \nlonger. \nwe The massage may only last one or two minutes before the baby squirms \naway, but that's okay. Just give as much as you can. \nV' Don't be afraid to make firm (but not hard) contact. Babies are more \nresilient than they \nlook and like a nice, solid, reassuring touch. If you use \nonly very light, tickling touch, the baby misses some of the benefits of \nmassage. \nEFTA00008322\n\nChapter \n18: \nMassage \nfor \nthe \nWhole \nFamily \n275 \nBaby \nmassage \nroutine \nThe \nfollowing \nmoves \nare \neasy \nto \ndo, \nas \nyou \ncan \nsee \nfrom \nFigure \n18-I. \nThe \nhardest \npart \nwill \nprobably \nbe \ngetting \nyour \nbaby \nto \nsit \nstill \nfor \nthem. \n1. \nWith \nthe \nbaby \nlying \nface \nup, \nrun \nyour \nfi\nngertips \nlightly \nup \nover \nhis \nabdomen, \nchest, \nand \nface, \nand \nthen \nbring \nthem \nback \ndown \nagain, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n18\n-la. \nRemember: \nThis \nmove \nis \njust \nto \nstimulate \nthe \nMeissner's \ncorpuscles, \nso \nit \ndoesn't \nneed \nto \nbe \nfirm \nat \nall. \nYou \ncan \nadd \nsome \nextra \neffectiveness \nto \nthis \nmove \nby \nsaying \n\"Wh0000sh!\" \nas \nyou \nbring \nyour \nfingers \nup \nover \nthe \nbaby's \nbody. \nAfter \na \nlittle \npractice, \nyour \nbaby \nbegins \nto \nanticipate \nthis \ndeliciously \npleasurable \nmove \nand \nsmile \nwhen \nyou \napproach \nhim \nwith \noutstretched \nfingers. \n2. \nWith \nyour \nhands \non \nthe \nbaby's \nsides, \nsweep \nyour \nthumbs \nup \nover \nhis \nabdomen, \nmoving \nthem \noutwards. \nThen \nlightly \nbrush \nthe \nthumbs \nback \nover \nthe \nskin \nand \nrepeat \nfour \nto \nfi \nve \ntimes. \nThis \nis \na \ncalming \nstroke \nthat's \ngood \nfor \nthe \ninternal \norgans. \nNote: \nThis \nmove \n(shown \nin \nFigure \n18-1b) \nrequires \nrelatively \nfirm \npressure, \nand \nyou \nmay \nneed \nsome \noil \nor \nlotion, \nas \nwell. \n3. \nUsing \nyour \nthumbs, \nmake \nlittle \ncircles \nwith \nmoderate \npressure \ninto \nthe \nfleshy \narea \nof \nbaby's \nlittle \ntush, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n18-1c. \nHe \nmay \ntry \nto \nsquirm \naway \nfrom \nyou \nwhile \nyou're \ndoing \nthis \nmove, \nbut \nyou \nmay \ncatch \nhim \nsmiling \nas \nhe \ndoes \nso. \nThis \nmove \nfeels \ngreat. \n4. \nApply \nan \nitty-bitty \nversion \nof \nkneading \nto \nthe \nbaby's \nchubby \nlittle \nthighs, \nas \nshown \nin \nFigure \n18\n-Id. \nBabies \nappreciate \na \nlittle \nattention \nto \nthese \nmuscles, \nespecially \nas \nthey \nbecome \nmore \nactive \nand \nstand \non \ntheir \nlegs \nlonger. \n5. \nHelp \nyour \nbaby \nstretch \nhis \nlegs \nby \ngrasping \nhis \nlower \nleg, \npushing \nhis \nknee \nup \ntoward \nhis \nchest, \nand \nthen \ngently \nstretching \nthe \nleg \nout \nstraight \ntoward \nyou \n(see \nFigure \n18-1e). \nRepeat \nthis \nmove \nthree \nto \nfour \ntimes. \nSupport \nhis \nopposite \nhip \nwith \nyour \nother \nhand \nto \nkeep \nhim \nsteady \nwhile \nyou \ndo \nthis \nmove. \nBabies \nnaturally \nlove \nto \nstretch, \njust \nlike \ndogs \nand \ncats, \nso \nthis \nmove \nfeels \nespecially \ngood. \n6. \nIf \nyou \ncan \nget \nhim \nto \nsit \nstill \nlong \nenough, \nyou \ncan \napply \na \nlight \n(and \nvery \nquick) \nversion \nof \nthe \nreflexology \nmoves \nfrom \nChapter \n14 \nto \nyour \nbaby's \nfeet. \nBabies \nare \nborn \nwith \na \ncomplete \nset \nof \nreflexology \npoints \non \ntheir \nfeet, \nand, \nIn \ngeneral, \nthey \nlove \nto \nhave \nthem \nstimulated, \nespecially \nthose \nlittle \ntoes \n(see \nFigure \n18-1f). \nEFTA00008323\n\n276 Part V: \nLiving the Good Life: Massage for \nEvery Body  \nFigure 18-1: \nMassaging \nBaby \nCapeInn'. \nBaby massage training \nBabies don't need any special training to begin enjoying massage, but mom-\nmies \nand daddies can certainly benefit by \nlearning a few tips \nfrom baby \nmassage experts.

The emotional reassurance and comfort given through caring touch do \na lot to renew a woman's balance, too. \nThe facial and the full day of spa pleasures I outline in Chapter 15 are sure to \nbe appreciated by menopausal women, as well as a massage. \nSenior Massage \nAs Art Linkletter once said, \"Old age is not for \nsissies.\" All sorts of things \nstart to happen to a body after It's been around for a while. In addition to the \nexpected stiff joints and achy muscles, many seniors \nfeel a deeper pain as \nwell, the pain of loneliness. \nMassage can help with the stiffness. It can help with the aches. And some-\ntimes it can even help \nwith the loneliness. Massage treats the little \nthings that \neventually become the big things. A little stiffness, for \nexample, could lead to \nthe awkwardness and \nlack of coordination that eventually ends up causing a \nfall. When seniors feel more relaxed and coordinated after a massage, they \nare less likely to fall. \nLittle daily doses of touch can make the difference between a lonely life and a \nmore fulfilled one. We are each born yearning \nfor touch as babies, and, as we \nage, the need for \ncontact is still there, though we often suppress \nit. \nA new movement is afoot for seniors these days. As the population in \nindus-\ntrialized countries gets \nprogressively older, people are not taking to the idea \nof retirement like they used to. A few \nyears ago, the word retirement used to \nmean \"ready to die.\" Now it means, \"twenty more years of activities and then \nmaybe slowing down a little.\" Massage can play a big part in keeping \nseniors \nvital and healthy \nduring those years. \nIn Chapter 5, I mention one of the world's favorite seniors, and a great fan of \nmassage, Bob Hope. He's had a massage \nalmost every day of his life for over \n50 years, and he says it's been an important part of what's kept \nhim going. As \nof this writing, he's nearing the 100-year mark.

It took both of us \nsev-\neral minutes working together to get his father \nup on the massage table, because he was weak \nand partially paralyzed. The stroke had also \ntaken \naway his ability to speak. \nFor almost an hour, I did \nthe best I could to help \nrelieve some \nof the stress and fear that this man \nwas going through. His muscles quivered. His \neyes looked directly into mine. Near the end of \nthe massage he \nreached his hand out and held \nonto my arm, and I felt a \npowerful silent com-\nmunication pass between us through the touch. \nFor 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute, he just \nheld \nme. \nThe next day I was scheduled to come \nmassage \nhim again, butthat morning I \nreceived a call. He \nwas gone. Now, several years later, I can still \nfeel the strength of his grip \non my arm. \nMassage can offer some serious help for older people suffering from \nParkinson's Disease, stroke, poor blood circulation, and other conditions. In \nsome cases, patients have avoided \namputations and terminal disability \nthrough the massage they've received.

Answering the \nfollowing questions, excerpted from \nMassage Therapy Career \nGuide, may give you a good \npreliminary idea about \nhow well suited \nyou are to this profession. \nEFTA00008339\n\n292 \nPart V: Living \nthe Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nThe ten traits of a \nborn massage therapist \n1. Do people swoon and tell you that you have \"great hands\" when you \nsimply place them upon their neck and \nshoulders and squeeze a little? \nYes/No \n2. \nDo you feel sympathetic pain \nsomeplace in your own body when \nsome-\none else tells you about their own pain? Yes/No \n3. Do \nyou feel very comfortable with your own and others' \nbodies? Are you \nfree from excess inhibition and \nbody image hang-ups? Yes/No \n4. Do you have the ability \nand desire to work several hours a day at a very \nphysical endeavor \nrequiring significant \nstamina? Yes/No \n5. Is It easy for \nyou to remain in silence for an entire \nhour (or several hours \nin a \nrow), without Indulging in conversation \nif a client doesn't wish it? \nYes/No \n6. Have \npeople ever told you that your presence makes them feel \npeaceful \nor calm? \nYes/No \n7. Do you take your own health \nseriously by exercising, watching what you \neat, and using \nmoderation? Yes/No \n8. Does the \nidea of changing your lifestyle and \nlivelihood seem exciting \nrather than horrible? Yes/No \n9. Is the human body a source of \nwonder and intrigue for you, making you \nwant to learn \nmore about how it works through intensive study? \nYes/No \n10. Are you \nwilling to invest a significant amount of time and money \nfor \nschooling, supplies, association \nmemberships, and equipment? Yes/No \nCount up the \nnumber of \"Yes\" responses and compare your \ntotal with the fol-\nowing: \n3 \n9-10 \nHead to the nearest massage \nschool to enroll. \n3 \n6—8 \nBegin serious \nInvestigation about the possibilities; \nsend away for \nmore information \nfrom massage schools. \n3 3-5 Seek the \nadvice and inspiration of established \nmassage therapists \nin your area \nwho may be able to give you \nsome Insight about what \ndaily \nlife in \nthe massage field is really like. \n3 \n0-2 \nConsider more deeply \nwhat your needs and \nmotivations are for \nlooking into \nmassage as a career. \nEFTA00008340\n\nChapter \n20: Have Hands, Will Travel: \nDoing Massage for a Living \n293 \nAn honest \ntook at yourself \nBefore you take the plunge, you \nreally need to stop and ask \nyourself: Am I \nreally into \ntouching all those strangers all day long for \nthe rest of my life? \nThis is not a career for \neverybody. It takes a certain kind of person \nto be a \nmassage therapist. \nAnd if you are that kind of \nperson, what you may discover, \nafter a short while, is \nthat those \"strangers\" you may be \ntouching are not \nreally strangers after all, but fellow \nhuman beings whom you can relate \nto on \na meaningful level \nthrough your newfound skills. \nMassage gives us an acceptable avenue \nfor empathy. Practicing \nprofessionals \ncan touch others in a \ncaring, compassionate way, helping \nthem with their \nproblems, easing \ntheir stress, and letting them \nknow they're not alone. \nMassage therapists are paid \nto be there for people. \nThat's no small thing. \nSo take an \nhonest look at yourself. Does that deep desire \nto help and \nempathize with others \noutweigh whatever reservations you may \nhave regard-\ning the \nnitty-gritty reality of dealing with \nthe not-always-wonderful \npublic? If \nso, maybe you have \nquite an adventure ahead — a massage \nadventure. \nThe Massage Adventure \nAfter you \nmake this fundamental choice and \ndecide to pursue your career in \nmassage, \nthen you have to prepare yourself for your new role in \nsociety. Yes, \npeople may look at you with different eyes \nwhen they see you carrying \naround one of those big \nmassage tables that look like \npadded suitcases. How \nwill they react? What will the neighbors say? \nIt's \nstrange to think of yourself as \nthis new person, isn't it? It's \nalmost like \nbecoming a \npolice officer or ship captain or any \nother profession that \ninvolves the \nwearing of a uniform. You're on display as what \nyou are, and it \nmay be uncomfortable at first. \nThese \nsensations gradually fade away, \nthough, as you begin to associate \nmore and more with other \npeople who make a similar career \ndecision. The \nfirst place you begin to meet your fellow \ntravelers is usually in massage \nschool. \nEFTA00008341\n\n294 Part V: Living \nthe Good Life: Massage \nfor Every Body  \nGetting trained \nChances are \nthat you already know somebody \nwho knows somebody who \nhas taken up massage as a \ncareer. It's ever more popular, \nwith people from \nmany \ndifferent backgrounds. \nThere are over 800 \nmassage schools in the U.S., \nwhere training usually lasts \nabout 6 months. In some areas, \nthough, you can get certified in as little as a \nhundred \nhours, and in others you need more than 1,000 hours, which can \ntake up to a full year. Other countries can \nrequire significantly more training, \nsuch as Canada for \nexample, with schools that have \n2,000- or even 3,000-hour \nprograms, lasting up to three years. \nMost schools offer part-time classroom \nhours for those students \nwho work another Job, and some even have \nSaturday classes \nonce a week for extended \nperiods. \nHere are \nsome of the things you explore in massage school: \n3 \nAnatomy \n3 \nPhysiology \n3 \nMassage (dub!) \n3 \nApplicable ethics, history, \nlaw, and so on. \n3 \nHygiene \n3 \nAllied therapies, \nsuch as hydrotherapy \n3 \nProfessional conduct and ethics \n3 And much more \nSounds like an actual academic \nprogram, doesn't it? That's because it \nis. \nMassage \nschool is not just rubbing and relaxing all day, but that \ndoesn't mean \nit \nisn't fun. Most graduates have very \nfond memories of their massage school \ndays. And, just like in \nother schools, you establish new \nfriendships, possibly \nspark romance, and change life paths. \nChoosing \na school \nAll \nmassage schools are not created \nequal. And the one you choose may \nplay \nan \nextremely important role \nin your overall \nexperience of massage. Some \nschools have a \nvery grass-roots feeling, and \nattending them makes you feel \nlike a \npart of the massage revolution as \nit unfolds across the globe, \ntouching \npeople's spirits, as \nwell as their bodies, in many \nimportant ways. Other \nschools are more interested in \nproviding their students with a \nno-nonsense, \ntechnically \noriented approach to massage \nbased more strictly on a medical \nmodel. \nEFTA00008342\n\nChapter 20: \nHave \nHands, Will \nTravel: Doing \nMassage for a Living \n295 \nAll schools let you attend an open house or a class to see whether the \nschool's \"personality\" is the \nright match for you. Take advantage of \nthis \nopportunity, and make sure to ask plenty of \nquestions when you meet past \nand present students. \nAnother way you can check the standards of a school is \nto see whether it is \naccredited by an official \norganization. In the US., for example, \nschools accredited \nby the \nCommission on Massage Training \nAccreditation/Approval (COMTAA) \nor the Integrative \nMassage and Somatic Therapies Accreditation Council \n(IMSTAC) had to meet some very strict guidelines. You \ncan be rest assured of \nthe quality. \nInformation about these accrediting organizations \nis available \nfrom the American Massage \nTherapy Association and Associated Bodywork \nand Massage Professionals. \nThe prospect of attending a \nmassage school may excite you, but you \nhave no \nidea how truly valuable the \nexperience is until you go through it yourself. \nSome of the high points include: \n3 \nCamaraderie \n3 \nIncreased knowledge and self-confidence \n3 Exposure to new techniques and systems \n3 A return to the stimulating, youthful \nlifestyle of the student \n3 Credentials you can travel with \n3 Self-transformation (See the sidebar later in this chapter.) \nChapter 21 lists ten of the best places to study massage. \nAn information-packed book about massage \nschools is available from \nAssociated Bodywork \nand Massage Professionals \n(ABMP). It's called the \nTouch Training \nDirectory, and you can order it by calling 800-458-2267 or \n303-674-8478 or by visiting liVIW .  a bmp . \ncorn. \nDetermining cost \nMassage school may \ncost anywhere from several \nhundred dollars a semester \nat a vocational technical school up to \naround $15,000 at some of the top \nschools, with the average seeming to hover in the $5,000 to $6,000 range. \nSchools in countries outside the U.S., based \nmore on a medical education \nframework, can cost quite a bit more. \nAs you can see, massage school usually entails a \nsubstantial investment. And \nthat doesn't include the \nequipment and supplies you need to \nget started after \nyou finish \nschool. You need things like a massage \ntable, business cards, and \nso on. So you need to think long and \nhard before plunking down that much \ndough for an education in touch therapy. This thought process is good. Think \nEFTA00008343\n\n296 \nPart V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nTransformation through massage school \nIt's a rare person who \ncan go through massage \nschool and not be transformed on some funda-\nmental level. What \nmakes this so, you ask? \nSeveral things: \n3 Everybody there is  making a  change of \nsome sort in their lives, which makes for a \nlot of  very open people, ready to share \nthemselves with you, and readyto have fun! \nye \nPeople enrolled in  massage school are \nthereto take charge of their own lives in an \nentrepreneurial sense and a health \nsense, \ntoo, so you're likely to do some important \nnetworking with kindred spirits. Many busi-\nness relationships have been forged,in the \nclassroom. \nV Many \nstudents are often scared out of their \nwits that they won't be able to support \ntheniselves after they graduate; this makes \nthertHeel vulnerable, and vulnerability is a \nvery endearing quality in most people. It lets \nyou all communicate on an honest level. \nv School offers you a \ntime-out from the race \nyou've been running in your life up to now. It \ngives you time to take stock of what's most \nimportant, of where you've been and where \nyou truly want to go. \nv When you begin literally \ntouching people on \na  daily basis, as you will in  school, you \nquickly get back in touch with \nwhets \nreal, \nand what matters. Life matters. Health mat-\nters. People matter. What you're doing is \nimportant, and as you realize this More and \nmore each \nday,your Ramey transform. \nAttending massage school is no guarantee for \na changed \nlife, \nbut it's \na \nprettY 909d \nbet \nthat \nyou \nmay come away with some insights and direc-\ntion thatyou never even considered before you \nbegan. Just \nstay open. \nof it as a filtering system that keeps the \nless-than-serious from getting into \nthe profession. Even with the costs, many \ntens of thousands of new massage \ntherapists enter the worldwide market every year. \nObtaining \nlicensing and certification \nAfter you graduate from school, you receive a certificate stating that you \npassed the course. Then, \nin many areas, you have to take that certificate and \napply to \ntake yet another exam to get your license. The \nlicense legally allows \nyou to practice massage in your area. You never \nthought it would be so com-\nplex, did you? \nThe laws regarding \nlicensing can indeed be confusing, and they're \ndifferent \neverywhere you go, so the best advice I can give \nyou is to do some thorough \nresearch into the regulations in your own area. Just a little accidental slip-up \ncould turn you into an outlaw massage \nrogue, which would not be good for \nyour professional reputation. \nEFTA00008344\n\nChapter 20: Have Hands, Will Travel: Doing Massage for a Living \n297 \nDiscovering \nyour neul lifestyle \nFreedom at last! After you make it through schooling, certification, and licen-\nsure, you're out there in the real world massaging real people — for real \nmoney. This new lifestyle you create for yourself is nothing like the boring 9 \nto 5 routine at your old job. But with your old job, you knew when you \nwere \nworking and you knew when you were off. Now, it seems like you're always \neither coming back from giving a massage, Just about to give a massage, or \nthinking of ways you can get \nmore people to sign up for massages. \nAh, there's the real rub; there's never an end to the massage work that needs \nto be done. \nWhen you work for yourself doing massage, you have to create some new \nrules and boundaries, like any self-employed person, so that your work life \ndoesn't swallow you whole. Whether you work in a spa, a clinic, a doctor's \noffice, or in your client's homes, you're going to need new boundary rules \n(see the sidebar about boundary rules in this chapter). \nSo how much wilt you make? (the real story) \nMany would-be massage therapists add up the numbers. \"Let's see, 50 dollars \nper massage, doing just 5 massages a day, 5 days a week, makes $1,250 per \nweek, times 50 weeks ... oh my god! I'm going to be rich. Rich, I tell you!\" \nAs a result of such calculations, many \nunsuspecting people have found them-\nselves several months later sitting in a classroom studying the function of the \ngluteus maximus muscle. They bide their time, going through the motions, \nJust waiting for their chance to graduate and become massage millionaires. \nWell, it doesn't always work out exactly that way. In fact, it seldom ever does. \nThe average annual salary of a massage therapist in the U.S. is under $20,000 \nper year, according to one association's statistics, and the number of mas-\nsage school graduates who end up not working in the field at all is \nsurprisingly large as well. \nThe truth is that, like any business, the massage business is a hard business. \nIt may be a little more \"romantic\" than some other fields, but the day-to-day \nreality of it includes an awful lot of good old-fashioned hard work, combined \nwith many things you may not have thought you would need, like marketing \nsavvy, business plans, self-promotion, and managerial skills. \nYou can, indeed, make a very good living doing massage, and that may coif-\ntinue to be the case as more and more people worldwide realize the benefits \nthat massage offers. But don't do it just for the money. You need to have \nanother, deeper, reason, too, or you may end up like certain old \nrock-and-roll \nstars and massage therapists, eventually burning out. \nEFTA00008345\n\n298\n   Part V: Living the Good Life: Massage for Every Body  \nBoundary rules \nThe rules you come up with for yourself as a \nmassage therapist are completely personal. No \ntwo \nmassage therapists need follow the exact \nsame guidelines. The importantthing to remem-\nber is to stick by whatever rules you \nset. \nThis \nincreases your self-esteem, makes life a  lot \neasier for you, and lets your clients know that \nyou're serious about your business. \nThe following are just a  few suggestions of \npotential boundary rules. Yours may be much \ndifferent Practice \nsaying your new rules out \nloud in front of the mirror a few times to your-\nself, as if you were talking to a client Eventually, \nthey seem natural. \ni•-• I  don't work on weekends. \npo I \ndon't work after 8 p.m. \n3 \nI  only take new clients by referral. \n3 \nI  don't accepttips/I do accept tips. \n3 I  have a  24-hour cancellation policy or the \nmassage must be paid for in full. \nThe tip of the \niceberg \nYou may have heard stories about massage therapists who \nget incredible \ntips from wealthy clients, and you may have wished that you, too, could \nreceive such large gratuities. This Is very natural. Yet, some people say that \nif you receive tips for massage, you do a disservice to the industry. They say \ntipping turns massage into a service (like a waiter serving food to your \ntable) rather than a treatment (like a doctor helping you find relief from a \nparticular problem). You wouldn't consider tipping your doctor, would you? \nThe problem here is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, of a larger under-\nlying Issue about how we want others to perceive massage. In the end, it's \nup to you whether to receive tips or not. It's hard to turn down that cash \nstaring you in the face as someone hands it to you. Believe me, I've accepted \na few whopper tips myself over the years. There's really nothing wrong with \nit, in the right circumstance, but it's also good to be aware of the larger \nissue. (See \nChapter 8 for more information.) \nBecoming a real pro \nAlter you're out there and actually making a living giving massage, you may \nsoon \nfind that there's more to the Job than just the hours spent working \nhands-on. In order to become a real pro, you \nneed to network your way into \nthe industry and become \na part of it, just like you would become a part of \nthe telephone industry, say, or the music industry. And that means ... going \nto parties! \nThat's right. You have to go to some \norganized massage parties, also known \nas conventions, that are held every year in various locations. Speaking of \nassociations, it's a great idea for you to join one of them, at least for a year \non a trial basis, to see how the contacts, information, and \nsense of commu-\nnity can help you get going with \nyour new career. \nEFTA00008346\n\nChapter 20: \nHave Hands, Will Travel: Doing \nMassage for a Living \n299 \nMake sure \nto subscribe to an industry \nmagazine or two, and read each \nissue \nfrom cover \nto cover. This may help you feel like an \ninsider as you become \nfamiliar with all the people, \nplaces, and history that make \nmassage what it is \ntoday. \nWhere the \nProfession Is \nHeaded \nIn a \nnutshell, up. Yes, up is the direction \nthe profession of massage therapy is \nheading. And \nI'm talking on a worldwide scale \nhere. If you're looking to get in \non a growth industry, you \nreally couldn't pick a better one \nthan this, because \nthe number of \nhuman bodies out there \navailable to be massaged is \ngrowing at \na tremendous rate. \nSometime around the publication of this \nbook, for \ninstance, \nworld population Is going to surpass the 6 \nbillion mark. So there's \nno \nshortage of clients. And there's \nmore wealth now than there \never has been \nbefore, so many \npeople can afford to pay for \nmassage. An even bigger trend, \nthough, and one that has \nalready started, is that insurance \ncompanies may \npay for massage because It's a cost-effective, \nhealth-care alternative. \nThat's right — in the future, as a massage \ntherapist, others may respect you \nas a part of the evolving \nmedical field, and your services may \nbe paid for \nthrough insurance billing. This is \nalready happening, but it may soon \nbecome \nmore common. \nAnd in \naddition to the respect and success that you \ncan claim, there's a \"cer-\ntain something\" that makes massage \nspecial, too. It's in the simple human \nact \nof touching — of \ncontact. That's our true specialty, \nand let's hope it never \nchanges, no matter how \nsuccessful we become. \nWhere you can go \nas a massage \ntherapist \nIf you spend the time to gain \nsome expertise in massage, people \nmay eventu-\nally \nbe seeking you out for your \nservices, rather than the other way \naround. \nBelieve me, this feels very \ngood. It is the exact opposite of \nsitting in your \nunderwear on \nSaturday morning searching \nthrough the want ads hoping \nthere's someone out there who \ncan appreciate your abilities. \nAfter you work to establish \nyourself as a massage therapist, \nyou may be at an \nentirely \ndifferent place than you have ever \nexperienced up to now. A good \nplace. it's a place that often \nleads to other places, as those \nwho gain success \nturn around and teach their skills to others in a \nvariety of ways. \nMany massage \ntherapists compound their success \nby turning to teaching at \nmassage \nschools, at weekend \nworkshops, and in books and \nvideos that they \ncreate for other \nmassage therapists. Some massage \ntherapists even go on to \nbecome consultants, speakers, and \nsought-after health experts. \nEFTA00008347\n\n300 Part V: \nLiving \nthe Good Life: \nMassage for Every Body  \nAnd just think, it all starts when \nyou make that simple, profound decision, to \nreach out and touch \nother people. Through massage \nyou can do that. \nThe gift \nbeyond price \nIf you decide to \npursue massage, you may \ndiscover some things about life \nand about yourself that you never would \nhave guessed otherwise. You will lit-\nerally \"get in touch\" with your own existence In a new way. You change. You \ngrow. This is the most valuable gift you \nreceive, and it comes to you when \nyou start to dedicate \nyourself to giving to others. What a \nconcept. \nGo ahead! Give it a shot!

You have made \na very wise and dynamic career \ndecision. One of the very first places this \ndecision may take you is a massage school \nof some kind or another. Massage \nschools each have their own personality, history, reputation, strong points, \nweak points, and soon. Choosing the right school \nto spend some important, \nlife-transforming \ntime in over a period of several months \nor a year is not a \ndecision you should enter into lightly. \nIn the same way that you end up making friends with \nthe people you are \nphysically close to \n(In school, at work, as part of white \nhouse internship pro-\ngrams, and so on), you \nusually end up choosing a massage school that is \nsomewhere in the vicinity of your house or apartment. However, if you \nhave \nthe luxury of mobility and can consider \nschools in a variety of locations, I \nhave compiled \na list here that may help. Keep in mind \nthat these schools are \nsome of my \npersonal favorites as well as those recommended by colleagues. \nThere are many other fine schools around. In the U.S. alone, \napproximately \n800 massage schools dot \nthe landscape, and that number just \nkeeps growing. \nIf you'd like to see a much more extensive list of schools, I suggest the Touch \nTraining Directory, published by Associated Bodywork and Massage \nProfessionals.

You don't \nnecessarily have to give the \nmassage \nyourself (in some cases this \ncould even be \ninappropriate), but you do have to \nput forth the \neffort to create the massage gift, \narrange for it, pay for it, and \nso \non. \nYou may be surprised at how \nincredibly warm a reception your \ngift \nreceives. \nMassage, ultimately, is always a gift for the \nperson who's receiving \nit. Even if \nyou're paying for it yourself, \nthere's something very special \nabout \nthe physical act of receiving \nthe massage. It's natural to \nrespond as though It \nwere a gift. The giver \nworks so hard, on such an \nintimate level, that you can't \nhelp but feel \nconnected to him, and \ngrateful. Try some of the suggestions \nthat \nfollow to accentuate this \nquality of the massage \nyou offer to others. \nSpa gift \ncertificates \nPurchase a gift certificate \nthat's good at over 700 \ngreat day spas in the U.S. \nand give it to a \ndeserving individual. To order \nyour certificate, call 888-SPA\n-\nWISH, and make sure to check \nout the coupon in the \nback of this book, \nbecause it gets \nyou a discount! Way cool. \nThe \nmassage birthday gift \nFor that \nspecial someone's birthday, your \nanniversary, or any other \nspecial \noccasion, hire a \nprofessional massage therapist to \ncome over as a surprise \ngift. This \ncould lead to some major gratitude \nimmediately following the mas-\nsage, so make sure you have a \nbottle of champagne chilled just \nin case. \nThe spa date \nWith so many spas around \nthese days, it's possible for \nmany people to get \naway to one for \na night or two. Arrange in \nadvance for a \"spa date\" on \nwhich \nboth of you get multiple \nmassages by a pro.

However, maybe there are a \nfew tricks here you haven't \nexperimented with before. Your pet is sure to be overjoyed that you've read \nthis book (and this chapter in particular) \nand are now ready to spend quality \ntime trying out some new maneuvers. \nIn fact, Sparky may have been the one \nwho slipped that bookmark onto this page when you weren't looking. \nAnimals can teach us \nhumans a thing or two about massage. Just \nwatch a cat, \nfor instance, over a period of five minutes (when it's not asleep), and you'll \nsee what I mean. They are \"in the moment\" all the time, responding to their \ninner \"call of the wild\" to do whatever comes \nnaturally. You can follow their \nlead with these massage moves. Yes, \nthat's right, go ahead and get crazy with \nyour techniques, letting your instincts take over as you bond and communi-\ncate with that special creature in \nyour life. I limit the discussion to cats and \ndogs here because those \nare the most popular pets, but there's no \nreason you \ncan't try these moves out on hamsters, gerbils, or Vietnamese pigs as well. \nPaul pressure \nSome people reserve their paw petting just for the \nfurry tops of the paws, \nwhich is a big mistake. If you slide your fingers into the webbing of the paw \npads underneath, you reach some areas \nthat are hard to get to otherwise. \nEver see your pets vigorously nibbling \naway at their own feet? This is the \narea they're trying to get, and if you help them out, they'll \nappreciate it. \nEFTA00008365\n\n31s\nPart VI: The Part of Tens  \nOuter ears \nToo many pet owners content \nthemselves with a cursory scratch of the \nears, \nwhen what \nyour pet really wants is an all-out \nassault on the base of the back \nof the ear where it connects \nto the head. This seems to \nbe an area that can \nnever \nget enough intense rubbing. Use \nthe tips of your index and middle \nfin-\ngers, really digging into the \ncartilage there that makes up the \near. \nInner ears \nInside the ear is a gold mine of prospective \nmassage points, and it would be \nsilly of you to stay away just \nbecause the inside of the ear \nis pink and poten-\ntially \n\"yucky.\" Go ahead, promise \nyourself you'll wash your hands \nimmediately afterwards, and then rub away on the little ridges and rolls \nwithin the cavern of the ear, exploring for \nnew areas of pet pleasure. \nBetty \nrub \nThe ever-popular belly rub Is quite \nsimple for most of us to perform. Just \nstart rubbing, and \nyour pooch keels over, kicking \nhis paws up in the air in \nanimal surrender. Experiment until you \nfind the exact spot that causes the \nmost frenetic paw movements. This is \"ground zero\" in \nbelly-rub territory. \nWatch out if you use belly rubbing on \na cat because it will quite likely try to \ngrasp your arm with its front paws and start clawing you with \nthe back paws. \nThis is the natural feline \n\"disemboweling\" reaction, meant to \neviscerate any \nunlucky little rodents it catches out in the yard. \n\"knee\" kneading \nDid you \nknow that what we usually think of as the \n\"knees\" on our pets are \nactually the wrists? It's true, and it's also true that this is a little-known area \nof intense pet-massage satisfaction. Just try \nmassaging your own wrists for a \nfew \nseconds. Feels good, right? Animals love it, too. Use your \nfingertips to \nrub little circles in all directions around the joint, down onto the paw a little \nbit, and back up onto the leg slightly, too. Pinch In between the bones and \ntendons, and do a few Joint movements while you're at it. \nEFTA00008366\n\nChapter 24: Ten \nMassage Techniques That Your \nDog or Cat Will Love \nChin \nwedgies \nJust at the tip of the jutting \nunderside of your dog or cat's chin you'll find the \nspot where \nthe two sides of the jaw come \ntogether. The little triangle of \nsoft \ntissue that you'll find \nthere is a site of supreme \nsensitivity. Use your pinkie \nfinger if necessary to reach into this area \nand rub back and forth with firm \npressure. If you do the maneuver correctly, your pet \nbecomes your slave \nand may do anything you ask it \nto, as long as you continue to provide such \npleasure. \nTall tails \nRight on top of \nthe base of the tail, where it \nconnects to the back, is a magical \nspot. Grind into it with enough finger \npressure, and your pet's tail will begin \nto rise \n(cats) or wag (dogs). A \"tall tale\" is a sure sign that \nthey like this very \nmuch. \nUnderarms \nWe tend to not pay that much \nattention to human armpits, often \nskipping \nthem altogether \nduring full-body massages. This is \nunderstandable, because \nsome armpits are not places most of us \nwould want to go, but it's also sad for \nour pets, whose \narmpits are licked clean on a daily, If not hourly, basis. You \ncan \ngive a good massage into this area by \nusing all four fingers held flat. Slip \nthem between the leg and \nthe body and rub your fingertips \ninto the many \ntendons, muscles, and ligaments you find attached there. \nNose \nnudgies \nPress \nstraight down onto the front of the nose with firm \npressure and rub up \nand down just slightly, \navoiding the nostrils. Try pushing until your pet \npushes \nback and you begin to get into a little \ndance with each other, leading \nyour pet around by \nthe nose, which is kind of cute. \nAt least it's cute for about \n30 seconds or so. \nDoggy \nand kitty \nchiropractic \nStarting at the tall, use your fingertips \nto massage each vertebrae, working \nyour \nway up the spine one bone at a time. Try mini-kneading \nmaneuvers and \nsome circular \nrubbing, making sure to get between the bones, too, Into those \nlittle \nnotches. \n319 \nEFTA00008367\n\n3\n20 \nPart \nVI: \nThe \nPart \nof \nTens \n \nEFTA00008368\n\nChapter \n25 \nTen Quick \nand Easy \nMassage \nTechniques for \nEasing Stress \nO \n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \nIn This Chapter \nr \nAchieving quick stress relief with \nmassage \nO\n00000000000•000000010•0000(2•0000000000000000000•• \nT\nhere are certain circumstances that are not completely conducive to \ngiving or receiving hour-long full body \nmassages complete with music, \ncandles, and scented oils. Like when \nyou're in a crowded elevator, for exam-\nple, or if you're sitting at a departure gate at JFK airport. In places like those, \nit's important to \nremember not to take all your clothes off and start rubbing \n(either \nyourself or another person) because that may \ngive massage a strange \nreputation. \nLuckily for \nyou, there are some quick little massage \nmoves you can use every \nday in public places to help relieve stress. And none of them require you to \nembarrass yourself. \nEasing Your Own \nStress \nThe \nfollowing are five quick and \neasy ways to ease your own \nstress with \nmassage. \nEye hooks \nThis move feels better than it \nsounds. Hook your thumbs up into the inner \nupper corners of your eye sockets, pressing in against the nose bone and up \nagainst the ridge of \nthe brow. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds. This is great for \nheadaches and sinus congestion (see Chapter 17 \nfor a photo). \nEFTA00008369\n\n322 \nPart VI: The Part of Tens  \nHeadache point \nKnown to shiatsu practitioners as \nLarge Intestine 4, or L14, this point is noted \nfor helping to \nrelieve headaches. It's located in the \nwebbing of your hand \nbetween the thumb and index \nfinger. The problem is that \nmost people don't \npress exactly the \nright spot when they try to \nstimulate this point on them-\nselves. \nThe spot Is not \ndirectly In the center of the meaty \npart of the webbing, but \nrather in \nagainst the bone of the hand. \nTo press here effectively, \ngrasp the \nwebbing between \nthumb and Index finger with your \nopposite hand, squeeze \nit, and then move your \nthumb in against the side of \nthe hand. See Chapter 11 \nfor a look at \nthis move. \nJaw circles \nWe \nall carry whole bunches of tension in \nour Jaw muscles (yes, even you). \nOne \ngood way to alleviate this is to use your fingertips and \nmake tiny little \ncircles right into the center of your Jaw \nmuscles. Open and close your mouth \nslowly at the same time to \nincrease the effect. \nYou may also want to try gently pulling your chin \ndown until your mouth \nbegins to open, relaxing \nthe law muscles. You may be \nsurprised at how tightly \nyou hold your mouth closed, \nperhaps out of a fear of looking like a dufus. Go \nahead, you're all alone; let your mouth hang open for a \nminute. It'll feel great. \nEar reflexology \nAccording to the zone theory, each point on the \nbottom of your foot reflects \nareas in other parts of your \nbody, as you find out in Chapter \n14. Did you know \nthat your ears also reflect every other \npart of the body? Yes, it's true. The \nChinese even have an extensive system of treating many disorders with \npres-\nsure on the ears. \nYou can give \nyour whole body a boost by simply rubbing your ears with a vig-\norous little kneading movement between your thumb and first two fingers. \nStart at the lobe below and \nwalk you fingers up around the outside to the top \nof the ear, giving little tugs outward as you go. \nEven if it does nothing for the \nrest of your body, it makes your ears feel great. \nEFTA00008370\n\nChapter \n25: \nTen \nQuick \nand \nEasy \nMassage \nTechniques \nfor \nEasing \nStress \nFoot \ndrainage \nMost \neveryone \nagrees \nthat \na \nfoot \nmassage \nfeels \ngreat, \nbut \nwhat \nIf \nyou're \nall \nalone \nand \nyou \nonly \nhave \na \nfew \nminutes? \nWell, \nthen \ntry \nthis \none \nmove \nto \naffect \nthe \nbladder \nand \nadrenal \nreflex \npoints \non \nthe \nbottom \nof \nthe \nfeet. \nIt's \na \ngood \nway \nto \nstimulate \ndetoxification \nand \nelimination \nwhile \nproviding \nsome \nstress \nrelief \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime. \nWith \none \nfoot \nup \non \nthe \nopposite \nknee, \npress \nin \nwith \nyour \nthumb, \nsliding \nft \nback \nand \nforth \nalong \nthe \narch \nbetween \nthe \nheel \nand \nmidway \nup \nthe \nfoot. \nCheck \nFigure \n14-1 \nto \nsee \nwhere \nthis \nreflex \nis. \nEasing \na \nPartner's \nStress \nFollowing \nare \nfive \nways \nyou \ncan \nhelp \nothers \nrelieve \ntheir \nstress. \nThe \nvice \ngrip \nTightly \ngrasp \nthe \ntop \nof \nyour \npartner's \nright \nshoulder \n(the \narea \nbetween \nthe \nshoulder \nand \nneck, \nconsisting \nmostly \nof \nthe \ntrapezius \nmuscle) \nwith \nboth \nof \nyour \nhands \nand \nhave \nher \nturn \nher \nhead \nvery \nslowly \nto \nthe \nleft. \nThen \nhave \nher \nhold \nthe \nposition \nat \nthe \nextreme \nend \nof \nthe \nturn \nfor \n10 \nseconds \nbefore \nslowly \nturning \nback. \nYou \ncan \nswitch \nshoulders \nif \nyou'd \nlike \nor \nrepeat \non \nthis \nside \nif \nonly \none \nshoulder \nis \ntight. \nThis \nis \nan \nexcellent \nway \nto \nhelp \nreduce \nmajor \nstress \nin \nthe \nneck \nand \nshoulders. \nHead \nsqueeze \nAlthough \nIt \nmay \nlook \nlike \nyou're \ntrying \nto \nsqueeze \nyour \npartner's \nhead \nlike \na \ngigantic \nmelon, \nyou're \nactually \ndoing \nhim \na \nbig \nfavor \nwith \nthis \nmove, \nespe-\ncially \nif \nhe \nhas \na \nheadache. \nWith \nyour \nelbows \nwell \nout \nto \nthe \nsides, \npress \nin \nwith \nthe \nheels \nof \nyour \nhands, \nusing \nvery \nfirm \npressure \nagainst \nthe \nsides \nof \nyour \npartner's \nhead, \njust \nabove \nand \nin \nfront \nof \nthe \nears. \nHold \nfor \n10 \nto \n15 \nsec-\nonds, \nasking \nyour \npartner \nhow \nthe \npressure \nfeels. \nDiscontinue \nif \nhe \nexperiences \nany \ndiscomfort. \nThis \nis \nespecially \neffective \non \ntension \nheadaches \nand \nhas \neven \nbeen \nknown \nto \nhelp \nwith \nhangovers. \n323 \nEFTA00008371\n\n3\n24 \nPart VI: The \nPart of Tens  \nHooking the \nskull \nStanding behind your \npartner, \nplace your thumbs \nat the base of his skull, \non the muscles at the top of his \nneck.

Make sure your fingers \ndon't slip across atop the \nhair but remain firmly pressed \nagainst the scalp as you move the skin and \nthin muscles below. Then, after a few seconds, lift \nyour fingers and repeat the \ncircles on \nanother spot on the scalp. \nWing \nlift \nHave your partner \nbring one hand around to her lower \nback, which will lift \nher shoulder blade up a little. Then use \nyour fingertips to hook into the mus-\ncles beneath the \nshoulder blade and pull steadily \nupward with light pressure \non the blade itself, which will \nstretch the entire upper back and also have a \nloosening effect on the arm. Repeat on the other side. \nEFTA00008372\n\nAppendix \nMassage \nResources \nM\nassage, like any new field you're just getting into, can be a little \nconfus-\ning at first.
