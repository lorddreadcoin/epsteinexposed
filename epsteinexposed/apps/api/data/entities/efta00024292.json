Because the victim meeting is being run by the \nFBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing who should be able to hopefully help \ncoordinate travel. Would you please provide with your new client's name as it appears on her ID, date of birth, \nemail address, and phone number? \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nl  St. Andrew's Plaza \nEFTA00024292\n\nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Gloria Allred < \nSent: Friday, October 18, 2019 5:02 PM \nTo: \nI  <> \nCc: \nSubject: Urgent.
