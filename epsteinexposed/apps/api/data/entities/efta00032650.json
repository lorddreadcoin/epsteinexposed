Please work with and \non it. \nThanks, \nFrom: Paulette Taylor\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 2021 7:16 PM \nTo: (USANYS) scl> \nSubject: Proposed Budget -- USA v. Maxwell \nHere is the budget for the focus group, pretrial juror questionnaire, and feedback on the opening statement and closing \nargument. \nThe proposal does not assume we would review and grade the completed juror questionnaires. As I noted in the \nproposal, the cost is approximately $8,000 per 100 questionnaires as we can grade only 5 or 6 an hour. We have not \nprovided this service in recent cases, e.g., Silver and Skelos. However, we have provided it in earlier cases, e.g., Martha \nStewart, where we were also present in court during jury selection. \nI am suggesting we hold the focus group on Friday, October 1, subject to consensus among the team. I can be available on \nother dates as necessary. \nLet me know what questions you have. \nEFTA00032650\n\n—Paulette \nTaylor'd Trial Consulting \nPaulette Taylor, President \nEFTA00032651",
