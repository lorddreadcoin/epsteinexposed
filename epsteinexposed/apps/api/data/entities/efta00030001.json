The informant mentions \nex Surrey Police officer, Mark Williams-Thomas, who is now a well-respected and reputable \ninvestigative journalist who has written several books. \nhttp://www.williams-thomas.co.uk/ \nhttps://www.mirrorco.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-investigator-claims-two-13510102 \nAs a police officer, he specialized in major crime and child abuse. I am told that Surrey police DID \ninvestigate allegations against Jimmy Savile but they could not pin anything on him, partly due to \nNorth Yorkshire Police not disclosing the information that they had on him. Mr. Williams-Thomas might \nbe a helpful contact, particularly with regard to North Yorkshire Police obstruction in child abuse \ninvestigations. \nAlso, if you managed to listen to the YOUTUBE interview with ex MI5 operative and now barrister, \nMichael Shrimpton, he alleges that Thames Valley Police, whom I believe also obstructed the \ninternational Project Spade, Toronto-led investigation, has (or had), German operatives (or spies) \nembedded in Thames Valley Police. Peter and Barbara Hofschroer, were seriously abused by the \ncriminal activities of North Yorkshire Police. There are strong indications that North Yorkshire Police \nhave close allies at extremely senior levels, in both the Austrian and German police, and the Austrian \njudiciary. I cannot say what, exactly, but have seen the results of obvious transnational criminal \ncollusion. \nRegards, \nYours sincerely, \nJean James \nEFTA00030001\n\nEFTA00030002",
