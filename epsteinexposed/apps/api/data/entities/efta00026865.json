In the interim, I've created \na Saved Search with all the Search Warrant Returns and the 1.23.20 Load. It's called \"SW Returns Plus 1.23.20 Load\" so \nyou can run your searches in that. Let me know if you want me add any more fields or modify it. \nOn Feb 22, 2020, at 7:22 PM, wrote: \nTotally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all \nmessed up —we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally \nevery search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because \nthe FBI case file is also huge. \nIf going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to \nprovide guidance on that. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, February 21, 2020 17:04 \nTo: \nCc \n) \ncM> \nSubject: Re: Epstein search materials for upload and privilege review \nMoving may be an issue, PAE had trouble releasing the data because they were so voluminous. \nEFTA00026865\n\nOn Feb 21, 2020, at 4:55 PM, wrote: \nAh, possibly it's the \"2020-01-23\" folder under Subpoena Returns?

I think they should be \nunder \"Search Warrant Returns\" but I don't see them there (or anywhere else under the Epstein overall folder). Let \nme know if I've just missed them, which is entirely possible, or if they're not accessible to us yet?

Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by (copied \nhere)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair.
