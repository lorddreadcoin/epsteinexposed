We have 10:30 sonogram tomorrow so I'll meet you up there after. \nCo-Chief, Narcotics Unit \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, December 17, 2019 9:15 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Follow Up on July 23 Incident Sensitive Disclosure Materials \nThanks again for taking the lead on this stuff. I'll be in a meeting from about 10:30am to 3pm today, but otherwise am \navailable if there's anything you want to discuss before tomorrow's conference. I have a 10am plea in White Plains \ntomorrow, so I'm planning to take the train up. \nFrom: Swergold, Jason (USANYS) \nSent: Tuesday, December 17, 2019 6:47 AM \nTo: Aida Leisenring <aleisenring@barketepstein.com>\nCc: \nSubject: Re: Follow Up on July 23 Incident Sensitive Disclosure Materials \n<a> \n; Bruce Barket \n<bbarket@barketepstein.com>\nAida, \nTo confirm, we are looking into whether video of the hallway, and videos and/or photos of the cell exist. We likely would \nmake those available for review in the same manner as the report. We are also looking into whether the orange rope was \npreserved and if it was, we will let you know our position on whether it can be made available for inspection. As discussed \nbriefly, since you have reviewed a photograph of the rope, we are not sure the basis for a physical inspection and would \nask you to articulate one for our consideration. \nCo-Chief, Narcotics Unit \nOn Dec 16, 2019, at 16:52, Aida Leisenring <aleisenring@barketepstein.com> wrote: \nHello Jason and Maurene, \nEFTA00016904\n\nThank you for taking the time to let us review sensitive disclosure materials in your office on Friday. We appreciate it. I \njust wanted to memorialize a few follow-up questions we had. \n1. It is our understanding that there is video surveillance in the hallway in or near the tier that was preserved in \nreference to the July 23 incident. We would like to see a copy of it. \n2. It is our understanding that there may be photographs or a video recording of cell 124 that would have been \ntaken shortly after the incident. If so, we would like to see them. \n3. If the orange rope was preserved, we would like to view it in person. \nJason, I understand that you were not aware of the availability of the above and that you would look into this additional \ndiscovery. I just wanted to memorialize our follow up inquiries for your records. \nLastly, if the items above are available, does your office take a position with respect to our request to view them? We \njust need to know so we can plan our next course of action. \nSee you in Court, and thank you again for your time. \nAida Ferrer Leisenring, Esq. \nBarket, Epstein, Kearon, Aldea & LoTurco LLP \n666 Old Country Road, Ste 700 \nGarden City, NY 11530 \nT \nF \nPlease note that my emailed has changed to: \naleisenring@barketepstein.com \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.
