I will do my best to ensure signature immediately. \nRe: this afternoon: it may be best to kick it to next week. If some time develops before 3, I'll let you know, but right now \nit is iffy. \nFrom \nSent: Friday, January 31, 2020 12:21 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSu Jecc. tp \nPP \nWe dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you —  we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA approval, \nbut it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ approval \nthis afternoon. Thank you! \nAnd separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if that's \neasier. \nthanks again \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021058",
