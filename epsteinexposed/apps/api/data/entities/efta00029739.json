We need to know as soon as \npossible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours \nsince this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those \nbasic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily \nfrustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nOn \nAug 10, 2019, at 08:46 wrote: \nPassed away.
