New York. \nIN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL \nCIVIL DISCOVERY MATERIALS, \nUSAO Reference No. 2o18Ro1618. \n19\n-MC-00179 \n(SN) \nFiled 03/24/2021 \nSEALED ORDER \nSARAH NETBURN United States Magistrate Judge \n*1 The United States Attorney for the Southern District of \nNew York has moved, pursuant to the All Writs Act, Title 28, \nUnited States Code, Section 1651, for an order relieving Boies \nSchiller & Flexner LLP (the \"Law Finn\") of its obligations \nunder the protective order issued on November 29, 2018, \nin Jane Doe 43 v. Jeffrey Epstein. et al.   I7-CV-616 (IGK) \n(SN) (S.D.N.Y.). The purpose of such order is to permit the \nLaw Firm to comply with a grand jury subpoena and provide \nmaterials to the Government in connection with a  federal \ngrand jury investigation. The motion is DENIED without \nprejudice. \nBACKGROUND \nThe Law Firm represented Jane Doe 43, a plaintiff in a civil \nsuit against Jeffrey Epstein and others. The case involves \nallegations of sex trafficking. Because of the sensitive nature \nof some of the discovery, the parties entered into a Protective \nOrder that deemed certain information to be \"Confidential \nInformation.\"' Protective Order, at ECF No. 177. As \nrelevant here, the Protective Order provides that Confidential \nInformation shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose \nother than the civil case. Id. at 1 4. At the conclusion of \nthe case, the Protective Order requires the destruction of \nConfidential hard-copy documents or electronic files. Id. at 1 \n12. The Protective Order further prohibits the distribution of \nConfidential electronic non-file copies without a court order. \nId. The Protective Order contemplates that a  subpoena for \nConfidential Information may be received and precludes the \nreceiving party from complying with the subpoena absent a \ncourt order. Id. at ¶ 13. Finally, the Protective Order permits \nmodification by the Court \"at any time for good cause shown \nfollowing notice to all parties and an opportunity for them to \nbe heard.\" Id. at 1  15. \nThe United States Attorney has served a grand jury subpoena \non the Law Firm for documents that are covered by the \nProtective Order. 2   The Government has represented that \nthe subpoena was validly issued as part of an ongoing \ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for possible \nviolations of, Title IS, United States Code, Section 591 and \nI 594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and Section 2422(b) \n(unlawfully enticing minors). The production of the materials \npursuant to the subpoena is solely for the purposes of the \nInvestigation and is subject to the protections and restrictions \nof Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The Law Finn \nhas indicated its willingness to comply with the subpoena so \nlong as it  is authorized to do so by a court order modifying \nthe Protective Order. \nDISCUSSION \n*2 The All Writs Act provides, in relevant part, that \"all \ncourts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs \nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions \nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\" 28 \nU.S.C. § 1651(a). The All Writs Act permits a court, in its \n\"sound judgment,\" to issue orders necessary \"to achieve the \nrational ends of law\" and \"the ends of justice entrusted to \nit.\" United \nStates v. \nNew York \nTelephone \nCo \n434 U.S. \n159, 172.73 (1977) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). The All Writs Act provides a \"residual source of \nauthority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by \nstatute.\" Penn. Bureau of Con. v. U.S. Marshals Serv. \n474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985). \"Although the Act empowers federal \ncourts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, \nit  does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever \ncompliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient \nor less appropriate.\" Id. The Court finds that it is authorized \nunder the All Writs Act to modify the Protective Order. \nThe Court, however, declines to exercise its discretion to \nmodify the Protective Order on the record before it. Before \nmodifying a  protective order on which parties to a  civil \naction presumptively relied, the Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit has directed district courts to find either \nthat: (1) the protective was improvidently granted or (2) the \nWESTLAW \n© 2021 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. \n1 \nEFTA00029951\n\nIN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL CIVIL DISCOVERY..., Slip Copy (2021) \ngovernment has established exceptional circumstances or a \ncompelling need. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, \n945 F.2d 1221, 1224 (2d Cir. 1991); see also ? Martindell \nv. International Tel. and Tel. Corp.    594 F.2d 291 (2d \nCir. 1979). Because the Government does not argue that \nthe Protective Order was improvidently granted (nor could \nit), and because the Government has not, on this record, \nestablished exceptional circumstances or a compelling need, \nthe motion to modify is denied. \nThe Government argues that the presumption against \nmodifying protective orders articulated in Martindell and In \nre Grand Jury does not apply here for two reasons. First, the \nGovernment argues that the standard from those cases applies \nonly to their specific procedural posture, specifically a motion \nto quash (In re Grand Jury) or an informal request without a \ngrand jury subpoena (Martindell). This is a distinction without \na  difference. Nothing in those decisions cabins the rule to \nthe procedural posture presented, and there is no logical \nreason to think a different standard should apply when the \nsubpoena's recipient does not move to quash. If anything, \nthe presumption of confidentiality applies more forcefully \nwhere, as is the case here, the Government's confidential \napplication deprives the interested party of the chance to \nquash the subpoena. \nSecond, the Government argues that the presumption does not \napply because the Protective Order protects only documents \nexchanged in pretrial litigation. It is true that the Court of \nAppeals has said the presumption may not apply in some \ncases because the expectation of continued confidentiality \nwas unreasonable. See  ? SEC v. TheStreet.com   273 F.3d \n222, 231 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"[S]ome protective orders may \nnot merit a  strong presumption against modification. For \ninstance, protective orders that are on their face temporary \nor limited may not justify reliance by the parties.\"); see also \nIn re \n\"Agent Orange\" Prod. \nLiah. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, \n147 (2d Cir. 1987) (\"[A]ppellants ... could not have relied \non the permanence of the protective order. The ... order by \nits very terms was applicable solely to the pretrial stages of \nthe litigation.\"). But this is not a case where the \"conditions \ncontemplated by the Court for revisiting the Protective Order \nhave now occurred.\" ? Allen v. \nCity \nof N.Y.  420 F. Supp. 2d \n295, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). All parties to the Protective Order \nhave not been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. See \nProtective Order ¶ 15. And although the Order contemplates \nthe disclosure of Confidential Information during trial, see id. \n1  14, that condition never arose. Instead, the parties settled, \nthereby foreclosing the possibility of atrial. Reliance on the \ncontinued effect of the Protective Order was and is, therefore, \nentirely reasonable. See SEC v. TheStreet.com  273 F.3d \n222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"In some cases, settlement would not \nbe possible but for the parties' reliance on a protective order.... \nThus, another compelling reason to discourage modification \nof protective orders in civil cases is to encourage testimony in \npre-trial discovery proceedings and to promote the settlement \nof disputes.\"). \n*3 In response to an identical application seeking to modify \na protective order in a different case between Epstein and an \nalleged victim, another judge in this District has reached a \ndifferent conclusion. That judge found that Epstein's reliance \non the protective order in that case was not reasonable, and \ntherefore modified its terms to allow the Law Firm to respond \nto the grand jury subpoena. I reach a different conclusion. \nCourts look to four factors when assessing whether reliance \non a  protective other was reasonable: \"(I) the scope of the \nprotective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the \nlevel of inquiry the court undertook before granting the order, \nand (4) the nature of reliance on the order\"? I  In re Ethylene \nPropylene \n255 \nF.R.D. 308, 318 (D. Conn. 2009). The Protective Order is \nnot a  blanket order that might be disfavored; instead, the \ndefinition of Confidential Information is limited and subject \nto objective standards, and the parties may designate material \nonly in \"good faith\" after attorney review. Protective Order \n11\n3, 8. The Court entered the Protective Order after briefing, \noral argument, and a direction from the Court to make \nmodifications to their proposals. See ECF Nos. 163-177. The \nProtective Order's language also specifically contemplated \nthat confidentiality would not be waived a parte where the \ngovernment has subpoenaed documents that were exchanged \nin discovery but never used at trial. Protective Order ¶ 15 \n(\"This Protective Order may be modified ... following notice \nto all parties and an opportunity for them to be heard.\"). \nFinally, no Confidential Information was filed with the Court \nafter the entry of the Protective Order such that the parties \ncould anticipate its public disclosure. 3  On this record, the \nCourt finds that the parties' reliance on the Protective Order \nwas reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality should \napply. \nThus the Martindell/In re Grand Jury Subpoena test applies \nhere. Under that standard, the Government's arguments \nfor exceptional circumstances and compelling need are \nWESTLAW © 2021 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. \nEFTA00029952\n\nIN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL CIVIL DISCOVERY..., Slip Copy (2021) \nunpersuasive. The Government argues that it needs the \nprotected documents because issuing subpoenas to other \nsources would alert the investigation's targets, possibly \nleading them to destroy evidence or flee prosecution. But \nthe Government has not offered any affirmations or facts \nsuggesting that the evidence in the Law Firm's possession \ncannot be obtained from other sources without compromising \nthe investigation. Instead, it relies on the general desire \nfor secrecy. That abstract concern, which applies to all \nconfidential grand jury investigations, is not \"a showing \nof exceptional circumstances or compelling need.\" In re \nGrand Jury,  945 F.2d at 1224.4  Indeed, if anything, the \nextraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police \ncarefully government intrusions into areas of protections \nagreed to by civil litigants and so-ordered by the Court. \nThe Government is attempting to side-step these protections \nby serving a  subpoena only upon a  party who is willing \n(and perhaps eager) to comply with the Government's \ninvestigation. \n*4 The subject matter of the Government's investigation \nis obviously serious. But to pierce the Protective Order, the \nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is \nan extraordinary circumstance, but that the reason for seeking \nthe documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is \na need to modify the Protective Order. The Government has \nnot met that standard. \nCONCLUSION \nThe motion for an order relieving the Law Firm of its \nobligations under the Protective Order to comply with the \ngrand jury's subpoena is DENIED without prejudice. This \norder does not preclude the Law Firm from producing \nmaterial in its possession responsive to the subpoena that \nis not covered by the Protective Order. It also does not \npreclude the Law Firm from disclosing to the Government \nan inventory of material in its possession that was marked \nconfidential pursuant to the Protective Order in order to allow \nthe Government to renew its application to the Court to \nestablish extraordinary circumstances or a compelling need \nfor the materials it seeks. \nBecause the Government's application is filed in connection \nwith an on-going criminal investigation, this Order and all \nother documents filed within this Miscellaneous Case will \nremain UNDER SEAL until further Court Order. \nSO ORDERED. \nAll Citations \nSlip Copy, 2021 WL 1164272 \nFootnotes \n1 The Protective Order covers \"information whose public release would violate common law and \nstatutory privacy interests, including information reflecting medical or psychological conditions, \nmedical or \npsychological treatment, prescriptions for controlled substances, non-public personal fi\nnancial information, \nsexual activity or sexual contact, education records, email addresses, telephone numbers, home addresses, \nsocial security numbers \nand similarly personally identifying information for parties and third-party \nwitnesses, \nany information subject to? \nI NY. Civil Rights \nLaw § 50 \nor? \n151, or any other information deemed private by \na Court of competent jurisdiction to include the tort of publication of private facts.\" Protective Order, 1 3. \n2 Because the Government has not provided the Court with a copy of the subpoena, the scope of that subpoena \nis \nunknown. \n3 The other decision found that reliance on a protective order is not reasonable when the order contemplates \nthat the confidential material may become public if used at trial. But that is an \nargument in favor of finding \nreliance on all protective orders unreasonable. The public has a strong presumption in favor of accessing \ntrial documents. \nSee  Under \nSeal v.  Under Seal,  273 F.
