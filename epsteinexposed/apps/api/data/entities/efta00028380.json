His last record \nshows an OUTBOUND flight on 6/14/2019 to Paris. \nSearch capabilities only show international travel and are limited if he travels to the islands because it is US \nTerritory. It is unclear why some OUTBOUND/INFBOUND records show Epstein going to/from the islands \nand others don't but it is likely up to how CBP inputs their information. \nHope this helps! \nEFTA00028380",
