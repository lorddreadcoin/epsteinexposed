Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nNUN York NY 10022 \n.1 212 957 7600 \nphone \nnvoacclaenTesser corn \nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter motion \nseeking the Court's assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell's ability \nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an \norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged \nvictims referenced in the indictment (\"Victims 1-3\"), subject to the restrictions of the protective \norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully \ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is now over 25 years old. Second, we request that the \nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") to release Ms. Maxwell into the \ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials \nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. \n1. Disclosure of Victim Identities \nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to \ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot \nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is \nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrowly-tailored and reasonable under the \ncircumstances of this case. \nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government's case is based on the \naccounts of Victims 1-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is \ntherefore critical for the defense to know the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so \nEFTA00018572\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 2 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 10, 2020 \nPage 2 \nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is \nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly \n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United \nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in \nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to \nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims 1-3 referenced in the indictment. \nIt  is now almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell's arrest, and the government is just now \nbeginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would \nbegin as soon as the Court entered a  protective order. Moreover, the government still has not \nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims 1-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2, \n2020. On July 14, 2020, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that \nit had \"begun preparing an initial production\" and would be \"prepared to produce a first batch of \ndiscovery as soon as a  protective order [was] entered by the Court.\"' The Court entered the \nprotective order on July 30, 2020. (Dkt. 36). The following day, July 31, 2020, defense counsel \ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims 1-3. The \ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it  would only disclose the identities of alleged victims \nthrough its production of Rule 16 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material \ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government's request, the defense provided a hard drive to \nload the Rule 16 discovery. However, the government did not make its first production until \nafter 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2020. \nThe government's initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials, \ntotaling nearly 13,000 pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content. \nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual. \nHowever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim I, 2, or 3. \nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three \nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to \ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has \nindicated that it  will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is \nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged \nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks \nuntil August 21, 2020 (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or \npotentially months until November 9, 2020 (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before \nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell's right to a  fair trial depends on \nthe defense's ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will \nbe significantly impaired until we know for certain the names of Victims 1-3. \nJuly 14, 2020 Tr. at  12:14-17; see also id. at 12:25-13:3 (\"Following the entry of [the] protective order . . . the \ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.\"). \nEFTA00018573\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 3 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 10, 2020 \nPage \n3 \nDistrict courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of \ngovernment witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975). Such \ndisclosure is warranted when there is a  specific showing that the disclosure is material to the \npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See \nid. at 302; United States v.  Rueb, \nNo. \n00 CR. 91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. \n5, 2001) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant \"ha[d] met his burden \nto show a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure\").2 This \nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a \ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and \nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. 09CR19A, 2009 WL \n427111, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex \ncrime \nvictim where \"defendant's ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is \nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim\"); see also \nid. (\"Absent knowing the identity of Victim 1, the defendant is precluded from investigating the \nfacts surrounding the crime charged.\"). \nThe defense's narrowly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity \nof Victims 1-3, and not the government's entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the \ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense \ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any \nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 ¶ 5), the \ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims 1-3. Nor is there any basis for \nthe government to claim that there is a  risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to \ntestify.;    To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in \ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein, \nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to \ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims 1-3 \nare no longer minors, but are now adults in their late 30s or early 40s, which provides additional \nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here. \n2   In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have \nconsidered the following factors: (1) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2) \nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case \nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a \nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses' names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the \nprosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege \noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants' defense complex and \ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb, \n2001 WL 96177, at *7-8 (citation omitted). The Second Circuit, however, has not adopted these factors, nor do they \nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities \nof alleged victims. \n3  Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a  danger to the community. \n(See 7/14/2020 Tr. at 37:15-21). \nEFTA00018574\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 4 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 10, 2020 \nPage 4 \nSee Warme, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime \nvictim where \"the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the identity to the defendant \nwould subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will refuse \nto appear or testify\"). \nWith each day that passes without knowing the identities of Victims 1-3, the defense is \nlosing crucial time to conduct a  meaningful investigation and prepare its defense so that Ms. \nMaxwell can receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. For these reasons, we \nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to \ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order. \n2. Ms. Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery \nWe also seek the Court's assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement \nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\"), and her access to the discovery in this case, so \nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed below, Ms. Maxwell has been \ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in \nher defense. \nIt has become apparent that the GOP's treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a  reaction to the \ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2019, Mr. \nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (\"MCC\") on sex \ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") \ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, \n2019, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On \nAugust 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein's body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government \nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein's \ndeath. \nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than \nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a \ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a \nmonth ago, on July 6, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms. \nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (40 days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three \nweeks longer than the 14-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under \ncurrent COVID-19 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to \nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom \ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms. \nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense \ncounsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being \nwoken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the \nEFTA00018575\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 5 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 10, 2020 \nPage 5 \nfact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting \nrisk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a  day and she has been forced to \nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell's access to the standard prison \nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively \ncurtailed or eliminated altogether. \nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to participate in her \ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms. \nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes \non them, and to discuss them with her attorneys. But there currently is no such structure in \nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a  hard \ndrive containing the discovery in the MDC, it  is our understanding that the hard drive containing \nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell. \nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a \nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a  computer on her floor to review discovery \nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are \ntwo significant flaws in this proposal: \n• The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms. \nMaxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including \nshowers. The BOP should not be permitted to force Ms. Maxwell to \nchoose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and \nparticipating in her own defense. \n• Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three \nhours a  day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing \ndocuments in a  complex case with voluminous document discovery, such \nas this one. As an illustration, the government's first set of production \nmaterials consists of nearly 13,000 pages of documents. Assuming it \ntakes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those \nmaterials, based on the BOP's proposed cap of three hours per day of \nreview, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of \ndocuments at the earliest by mid-November 2020. This is entirely \nunworkable under the schedule set by the Court. \nMs. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not \nbe specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her \ndefense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous \ndiscovery that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 40 hours a week \nor more reviewing the discovery. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time \nEFTA00018576\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 6 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 10, 2020 \nPage 6 \nto review the discovery in the MDC so that she can engage in her defense full-time. We \ntherefore request that Ms. Maxwell: \n• Be released to the general population and be granted the privileges given \nto other pretrial detainees. \n• Be given significantly increased access to a computer terminal in order to \nreview the discovery in this case. \nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms. \nMaxwell's motion. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Christian R.
