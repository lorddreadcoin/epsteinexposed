I've contacted Doubletree by Hilton Santa Monica \nfor a  refund for those charges. Thanks for your patience in this matter. \nu  Ject: RE: Final Voucher prepared y a travel arranger is pending your review \nUnfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 —  see the \ninvoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I'm supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily \nallowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax. \nPlease let me know when it is corrected and I will review it again. \nFrom: \netravelservices@cwtsatotravel.com♦ \nSent: Wednesday.
