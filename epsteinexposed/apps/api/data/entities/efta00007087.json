I  am currently employed as a  Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (\"FBI\") and have been so employed for the past ten years. I am assigned to the \nMiami Division, Palm Beach County Resident Agency, and for the past three years, I have \nbeen assigned to investigate mostly child exploitation cases. As explained in my earlier \ndeclaration, I am the case agent assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein's solicitation \nof minors to engage in \nprostitution and his \nlewd and \nlascivious \nconduct with \nminors. \n2. After filing the Declaration in Support of the United States' \nResponse to the \nMotion to Quash \nSubpoenas, I located and interviewed another girl, \nwho was \nrecruited to engage in \nprostitution with Jeffrey Epstein. \n3. \nIn 2001, \nage 14, was \nrecruited by another female, `1\", to provide \nHays 1 \no4 \n4 \nEFTA00007088\n\nEpstein with a personal massage. The first time that IM\" brought \nto \nEpstein's \nhome at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, and Epstein \nin front offl. S' was seventeen years \nold at the time. l's\" first contact \nwith Epstein, at the age of 15, was for the purpose of \nproviding him with personal massages. \n4. estimates that she returned to Epstein's \nhome approximately 100 \ntimes between 2001 and 2003. Epstein in presence \nduring all but \nthree of the massages she provided. During additional visits, Epstein tried to engage \nin more and more sexual behavior. On one occasion, Epstein introduced an unidentified \nfemale who \nAt the end of each massage, I. was paid $200 to $400 by \nEpstein. \n5. On one occasion, when-. was approximately 16 years old, Epstein's \nassistant, \n, telephoned MEI and told \nher that Epstein wanted to \nphotograph her. traveled to \nEpstein's Palm Beach home where \ntook a series • \nof nude photographs of posing at several locations on Epstein's property. \n• \nwas paid $500 for posing nude for the photographs. \nMreported that used \na \ndigital camera to take the nude photographs. \n6. This information further leads me to the believe that the computers that are the \nsubject of the grand jury subpoena are likely to contain evidence of Jeffrey Epstein's \nsolicitation of minors to engage in prostitution and may contain child pornography. \nDays 2 0 4 \nEFTA00007089\n\nI declare under \npenalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, that the \nforegoing is \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \nExecuted this day \nof August, 2007. \nSpecial Agent-\nFederal Bureau \nof Investigation \nBays 3 o4i 4 \nEFTA00007090",
