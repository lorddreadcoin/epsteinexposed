Let's produce in their original format to both for now. If Maxwell has trouble opening them at MDC, \nwe'll deal with that after she tells us she can't open them. She has not identified every single excel and txt file from past \nproductions as problematic, so she will hopefully be able to open these. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 10:47 AM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] ; (USANYS) ; \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nHow are we handling producing to Maxwell vs. Counsel? With these files there are tons of text and excel files that need to \nbe converted in order to be sent to MDC. Are we also producing the converted versions to defense or rather the original \nnatives? \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] a> \nSent: Thursday, September 24, 2020 2:34 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] <a>; \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <a>; \n(USANYS) <   \n>; \n<a) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nThe zip files have been copied to the below location.
