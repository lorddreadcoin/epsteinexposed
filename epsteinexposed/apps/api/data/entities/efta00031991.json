As you likely know, our Office has been conducting its own investigation of \nEpstein and his associates, and we recently charged one of Epstein's co-conspirators, Ghislaine Maxwell. \nWe are just beginning the process of producing discovery in that case, and we were hoping to touch base with you on \ndocument collection. In particular, we understand OPR gathered a significant volume of material, including internal \nemails and the like, regarding the prior SDFL investigation (, I think our team may have reached out to you directly at \nvarious points over the past year on that subject is well). We have not yet decided to what extent we have an obligation \nto gather or review that material in connection this case, but to facilitate our consideration of those issues, it would \nEFTA00031991\n\nextremely helpful for us to have a better sense of the universe of materials that may exist and that you may have collected \nas part of your review. \nIf you have some time later today or early next week for a call, please let us know. \nThanks, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nTel. \nEFTA00031992",
