This looks great to me, and I defer to you guys on the bigger picture stuff, since \nyou're closer to the facts and the law here. Thanks so much for everyone's excellent work on this—really impressive stuff. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, November 7, 2021 10:04 PM \nTo: (USANYS) c \nscM\n>\nSubject: RE: Daubert motion \nHi all, \nHere's a version that incorporates the Loftus section. The plan is to have a draft in the chiefs' inbox when they wake up, \nso if folks are still up, would love comments as you can. \nI'm going to write the Rocchio section now, so that will come later... \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, November 7, 2021 8:00 PM \nSubject: Daubert motion \nHi team, \nIn the interest of expediency, here is the Daubert motion for your comments. I still need to write my section, and I'm \ndoing some significant revisions to the Loftus section, but the Dietz section is done —crushed it. That's the bulk of \nthe motion, so feel free to read that over, and I'll send you the rest in a second round later. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028211",
