His suicide has \nleft many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with \neveryone who has \nbeen affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, \nthey will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law \nenforcement agency with their investigations, if required. \nWednesday 20th \nNovember, 2019 \nPublic Affairs \nUnited States Department of Justice \nU.S. Attorney's Office I Southern District of New York \nEFTA00010384",
