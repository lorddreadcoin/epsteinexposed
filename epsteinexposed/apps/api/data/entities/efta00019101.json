This case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation of a young girl by \nnotorious pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (\"Epstein\"). It all started in 1994 \nwhen 13-year-old Jane Doe met Epstein and Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (\"Maxwell\") at a \nsummer camp in Michigan. Jane Doe was their first known victim and was subsequently abused \nby Epstein and Maxwell for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and \npsychological trauma and distress. Despite that, Jane Doe has persevered and survived to tell her \nstory, to hold her perpetrators accountable and to seek justice for the atrocities committed against \nher. \n2. Throughout his life, Epstein systematically perpetrated acts of molestation. \nexploitation, assault and rape on hundreds of young girls. Epstein's system of abuse was \nfacilitated in large part by his co-conspirator and accomplice, Maxwell, who helped supply him \nwith a steady stream of young and vulnerable girls—many of whom were fatherless, like Jane \nDoe, and came from struggling families. \n1 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \nEFTA00019101\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n3. This system, which took years to develop, all started with them exploiting and \nabusing Jane Doe who they used as a guinea pig to refine their criminal enterprise and widen their \nnetwork of additional sexual abuse victims. \nTHE PARTIES \n4. Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of the State of California. At all times relevant to this \nsuit, Doe was a minor child living in Florida and New York and who was sexually abused while \nshe was a minor by Defendants in New York. \n5. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in the State of New York. \n6. Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the \nEstate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. \n7. Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the \nEstate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8. Plaintiff is domiciled in California. \n9. Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands at the time of his death. As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, \nDarren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The matter \nin controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000, and therefore jurisdiction in this Court is proper. 28 \nU.S.C. § \n1332(c)(2). \n10. Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in New York. \nI  I. A substantial part of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the \nSouthern District of New York, thus venue in this district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). \nJURY DEMAND \n12. Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all of her claims in this action. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nEpstein and Maxwell's Abuse of Doe \n13. In the summer of 1994, Jane Doe met Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at \nInterlochen Arts Camp in Michigan when she was only 13-years-old. Doe was there as a student \n2 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \nEFTA00019102\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nin the voice program. Doe was sitting alone on a bench between classes when Epstein and \nMaxwell approached her. Epstein bragged to her about being a patron of the arts and giving \nscholarships to talented young artists like Doe. Epstein and Maxwell probed her at length about \nher background, family situation and where she lived. As Doe got up to leave, Epstein requested \nher mother's phone number back in Florida. She was alarmed by his request, but also feared that \nshe could not refuse the older man's request so she complied and provided him with the phone \nnumber. \n14. Several weeks later, once Doe had returned from Michigan to Florida, Epstein \ncalled Doe's home. Epstein first spoke with Doe's mother about how he mentors young kids and \nprovides scholarships for the arts. He requested to speak to Doe and invited her and her mother to \nhis mansion in Palm Beach. He sent a driver across town to pick them up. \n15. Over the course of the next several months, Epstein and Maxwell attempted to \ngroom and mentor 13-year-old Jan Doe. Epstein gave himself the name of Doe's \"godfather\" \nwhile Maxwell acted like an older sister to her. They took her to movies, went shopping with her \nand lounged around Epstein's estate with her. Epstein and Maxwell then started to make sexual \nreferences when they were with her. For instance, Maxwell told Doe that having sex with ex-\nboyfriends was easy because once you slept with them \"they've been grandfathered in and you \ncould go back and fuck them whenever you wanted.\" Epstein also started to slowly display his \npedophilic ways when shopping with Doe and Maxwell. Instead of Doe picking out clothes she \nwanted to wear, Epstein insisted that she pick out and wear little children's cotton underwear. \nAlso, after nearly every visit with Epstein and Maxwell, Epstein sent Doe home with two or three \none-hundred-dollar bills to give her mother since \"she's having a hard time and struggling as a \nwidow.\" \n16. While these visits made Doe extremely uncomfortable, Epstein and Maxwell made \nher feel she could not refuse them. During this time, Epstein started to pay for voice lessons for \nDoe and insisted that Doe could not advance her career in any way without him. When Doe \nexpressed hesitation about spending time with Epstein and Maxwell or acquiescing to their \ndesires, Epstein and Maxwell would threaten Doe, and scold her for being \"ungrateful\". \n3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \nEFTA00019103\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n17. During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he \nintroduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump, \nEpstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, \"This is a good one, right?\" \nTrump smiled and nodded in agreement. They both chuckled and Doe felt uncomfortable, but, at \nthe time, was too young to understand why. \n18. Towards the end of 1994, Epstein invited Doe into his pool house, where he \ngrabbed her, put her on his lap and started masturbating. Epstein told her that was what to expect \nfrom photographers who were soon going to be take modeling pictures of her. However, when \nDoe was ultimately photographed by these professional photographers, they did no such thing.\n19. Over the next few years, the sexual abuse escalated. On a regular basis, Epstein \nwould digitally penetrate Doe, force Doe to perform sexual acts on him and apply vibrators on \ndifferent parts of Doe's body. The abuse occurred at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida, \nEpstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in New York City, and Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. \nWhen travelling to these places, Doe often flew with Epstein and Maxwell in Epstein's private jet. \n20. In 1996, when Doe was 16-years-old, Epstein moved Doe to New York City. At \nfirst, Epstein put Doe up in his apartment on 65th Street and 2nd Avenue. After a few months. \nEpstein co-signed the lease for Doe and Doe's mother for an apartment. Additionally, Epstein paid \nher tuition at a private high school in Manhattan as well. \n21. Once Epstein had secured Doe in New York and made her and her family \ncompletely dependent on him financially (including, for the roof over their heads), Epstein's abuse \nof Doe continued to escalate. \n22. In 1997, while at Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in the City of New \nYork, Epstein asked 17-year-old Doe if she had a boyfriend. Doe replied that she did not. Epstein \nresponded that when she did have a boyfriend she would want the sex to be \"good\" and that she \nshould \"get it over with already,\" meaning lose her virginity. Despite Doe's resistance, Epstein \nthen pushed Doe down onto her stomach and raped her. From that point forward for several years \nin New York, Epstein raped Doe on multiple occasions. \n4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \nEFTA00019104\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \na. \n11 \nDJ\n6 \n0. \n12 \n- \n>4  .R\nai\nt \nN. \n14 \n6:I \nTD  a IS \n§ \n16 \na \n2 \n`') 17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n23. During Doe's time in New York, Maxwell also regularly facilitated Epstein's abuse \nof Doe and was frequently present when it occurred. \n24. In 1999, Doe moved to Los Angeles to start a career. Upon moving to Los Angeles \nand being physically away from Epstein and Maxwell, Doe finally felt like she could escape \nEpstein's abuse and stopped returning his frequent calls where he would threaten and berate her for \nnot appreciating him. \n25. Despite Doe's physical escape from Epstein and Maxwell, the years of abuse and \nexploitation perpetrated against her by them cause her immeasurable pain and suffering every day. \nEpstein's Death and Will \n26. In July 2019, Epstein was indicted by the Unites States Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York. \n27. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan \nCorrectional Center, where he was being held pending trial. Upon information and belief, New, \nYork City's medical examiner concluded Epstein died by suicide. \n28. On August 15, 2019, Epstein's last will and testament (the \"Will\") was filed in the \nProbate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. \n29. The Will indicated that it was executed by Epstein on August 8, 2019 at the \nMetropolitan Correctional Center. The Will was accompanied by affidavits from Darren K. \nIndyke and Richard D. Kahn attesting to their \"Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and \nAppointment of Local Counsel.\" Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn also filed a Petition for Probate and for \nLetters Testamentary in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. \n30. The Will's first article directs Epstein's executors \"to pay from my estate all \nexpenses of my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my \nestate and all of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate.\" The Will further \ndirects \nthat \"after the payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST,\" Epstein \"give[s] all of my \nproperty, real and personal, wherever situated...to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust.\" \n5 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \nEFTA00019105\n\nI \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n31. On August 26, 2019, Defendant Darren K. Indyke filed a Certificate of Trust with \nthe Superior Court for the Virgin Islands, confirming that he and Defendant Richard D. Kahn are \nthe two Trustees of The 1953 Trust. \n32. On September 6, 2019, Magistrate Judge Carolyn P. Hermon-Percell of the \nSuperior Court of the Virgin Islands ordered that Epstein's will be admitted to probate and \nauthorized Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn to administer the estate. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Sexual Assault) \n33.
