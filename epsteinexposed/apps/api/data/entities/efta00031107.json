It's in brief format, at the District of New Hampshire's request. The \nplan is to file it in SDNY and email a copy to the DNH magistrate judge, but let us know if you think we should proceed \notherwise (the AUSA in DNH didn't seem to have a view on how we should file). We didn't want to file it with New \nHampshire captions and signature blocks, as much as I would have gotten a kick out of signing as a SAUSA. But let us know \nif you think we should be going about this a different way. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00031107",
