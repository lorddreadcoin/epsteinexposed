Gershman said of \nStrauss. \nNevertheless the application process is \nunderway in the Southern District, sources \nsaid, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck \nSchumer, D-N.Y., holding powerful sway over \nthe process. Asked to handicap top possible \nsuccessors, lawyers named three people: \nDamian Williams \nDamian Williams is a veteran SDNY \nprosecutor who heads the district's Securities \nand Commodities Fraud Task Force. He \nprosecuted former politicians Sheldon Silver \nand Chris Collins in recent years, and is \nwidely regarded as a steadying presence \ninside the halls at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza. \nWilliams, who would be the first Black person \nto head the office, is a former law clerk for \nD.C. Circuit Judge Merrick B. Garland, \nBiden's nominee for attorney general who is \nslated for a Feb. 22 confirmation hearing in \nthe Senate. \nThe Garland clerk chain, dozens strong, \ncould be fertile ground for possible picks, \nlawyers said, on the theory that a pre-existing \nrelationship with the man who likely will lead \nBiden's Department of Justice could be \nvaluable. \nEFTA00032899\n\nKatherine Goldstein \nA white collar partner at Akin Gump Strauss \nHauer & Feld LLP, Katherine Goldstein is a \nformer SDNY Securities and Commodities \nFraud Task Force chief with a sharp legal \nmindwho has worked on modernizing and \nimproving insider trading enforcement. She \nhas handled a number of high-profile white \ncollar fraud cases. \nAfter Strauss and Mary Jo White, who held \nthe post from 1993 until 2002, Goldstein \nwould be the third woman to take the job in its \nmore-than 200 year history, if confirmed. \nAnjan Sahni \nLike Williams and Goldstein, Anjan Sahni, a \nWilmerHale white collar partner, is a former \nSDNY Securities and Commodities Fraud \nTask Force chief. \nSahni, who is of South Asian descent, also is \nnoted for his work on a defense team \nthat won acquittal for Citigroup trader Rohan \nRamchandani in a closely-watched forex-\nrigging criminal trial. \nWilliams, Goldstein and Sahni are all said to \nbe friendly with, and have professional ties to, \nformer Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet \nBharara, who was fired by the Trump \nadministration in 2017. Sources said Bharara \nhas a direct line to Schumer as the \napplication process unfolds. \n--Editing by Jill Coffey. \nEFTA00032900",
