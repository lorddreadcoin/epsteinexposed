Masked that I get this back to them tomorrow. I am hoping to get it back to \nthem by tomorrow early afternoon so I can turn their next round of edits and send to= to review as soon as possible. \nalready reviewed the initial draft I sent to the chiefs, but I wanted to make sure you all had an opportunity to \nreview and comment on this before I send this back to the chiefs. I know it is quite lengthy, so apologies in advance. \nThanks, \nM \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, New York 10007 \nTel: \nEFTA00027081",
