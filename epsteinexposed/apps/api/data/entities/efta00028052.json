One thing to note is that the confidential marking is not as large and glaring as we typically use but it \nis still clearly visible in the bottom left. I think I will probably need to go through to the excels and mark them individually \nconfidential but that shouldn't be too troublesome. Once answers my question I will ask him to export the \nproductions to our discovery folder so that we can start prepping the remainder of the materials. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 5:40 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nThanks) \ncM> \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 5:39 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nYes, I'll hopefully have it done soon. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 5:26 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: FW: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nWill, would you please review these and let me know if there's anything you think I need to check? \nFrom: \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \n<CRozier@usa.doj,gov>\nSent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 11:32 AM \nTo: \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <M>: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nThe production of the documents has been completed.

Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential \n2. We are working on that. \n3. I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. \n4. That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp \nthem. \nThanks! \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n<CRozier@usa.doj,gov>\nSent: Friday, September 18, 2020 10:10 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] \n>; \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \n0; \nI know you want to produce these documents can you please tell me the following: \n1.
