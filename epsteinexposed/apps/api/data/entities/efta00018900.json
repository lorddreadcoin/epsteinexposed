Apparently through (with?) their attorney, \nthey talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. \nThe reporter believes \nthat it was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it \nwent nowhere. \nCNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information, \nso if they fed their competition will go with the story, they will, too. \nAny guidance or \nthoughts are welcome. \nPublic Affairs \nU.S. Attorney's \nOffice for \nthe \nSouthern District of New York \nEmail: \nWebsite: www.justice.gov/usao-sdny\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/usaosdnv\nFollow \nus on Twitter: @SDNYnews \nEFTA00018900",
