    "text": "\n\nFrom: \"-(USANYS)\" \n• \nTo: ' (USANYS)\"\nSubject: RE: \nDate: Tue, 04 Aug 2020 19:57:53 +0000 \nWhat 302s does she come up in other than and and what is the context? \nFrom: (USANYS)\nSent: Sunday, August 2, 2020 2:03 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: \nOne of the difficulties in answering this question is that we don't have the pros memo. Here's what I've been able to \nlearn from what we do have: \nWe do have the transcripts of their grand jury testimony (although not the AUSA preamble). She is not mentioned in the \nintroductory part of the agent's testimony where they are walking through the various targets and subjects of the \ninvestigation. By contrast, Epstein, _-and -re (pp. 5-6). In fact, she only comes up once in the \nentire grand jury presentation, namely in the context of the agent's summary of how met Epstein. \nSpecifically, the agent testifies as follows: \nI'm sorry, the question you asked me was: How did they meet? They met by a  friend of Mr. Epstein's. Jane Doe \nNumber One was working at Mar-a-Lago and a  friend of Mr. Epstein's, Ghislaine Maxwell. \nWould you like the spelling? \nTHE REPORTER: Yes, please. \nTHE WITNESS: G-H-I -S-L-A-I-N-E, Maxwell, who was a  friend of Mr. Epstein, met Jane Doe Number One at \nMar-a-Lago and Jane Doe Number One soon after began working and providing massages for Mr. Epstein \nThe fact that she has to spell it strongly suggests the name also didn't come up during whatever preamble the AUSA \nprovided. But either way, that's it. \nAs you know, she is not mentioned in the NPA and, according the lawyer at OPR who is running the NPA investigation, \nMaxwell does not come up much, if at all, in the documents they have reviewed in connection with that issue. \nThere were no federal search warrants, so there would be no applications in which target subjects would be identified. \nThere was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't have the SDFL file and we haven't asked \nPalm Beach county for theirs. Presumably we will get that at some point. \nMaxwell was added to the caption of the FBI file at some point, and she does come up in some of the 302s (including the \nand glnterviews in a  manner we're now familiar with). That said, we have the FBI file, \nincluding all of their 302s, and we plan to produce those. \nI think the proposal to get the physical file from SDFL makes sense and is manageable. We'll have to work through how to \ndo that, but OPR has at least some of that material which we could get quickly and start with (including the pros memo), \nand once we figure out how to get the rest, 24 boxes of material is a doable project. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Friday, July 31, 2020 3:17 PM \nEFTA00029177\n\nTo: \nSubject: RE: \n(USANYS) \nThanks —  yes, having an understanding of how (if at all) Maxwell fits into the Florida evidence and investigation (beyond \njust the simple view that she wasn't the focus) would be helpful. \nFrom: (USANYS) \n<\nSent: Friday, July 31, 2020 11:14 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: \nAsking the team to look into this. We don't have their pros memo (although OPR does and if we wanted to make a more \ntargeted ask, we could conceivably start with that). We do have the one (state) search warrant application for the Palm \nBeach residence, team will check that now. Team is not aware of any other search warrant applications done as part of \nthe SDFL investigation, but will take a look to confirm. We also have the grand jury testimony and I'm asking team to \nconfirm that Maxwell was not mentioned in that testimony. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Friday, July 31, 2020 10:55 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: \nDo you know, or can you find out, whether Maxwell was identified as a target / subject / target subject or whatever the \nlingo may have been in any warrants or other materials from the SDFL case, to the extent we know? \nCounsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00029178",
