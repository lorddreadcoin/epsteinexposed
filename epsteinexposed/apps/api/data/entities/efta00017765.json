We cannot remove the closing from the email notices (about five registrants have email \naddresses). If that is acceptable, let me know and I will follow up with the instructions on how to proceed. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:57 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein 2018R01618 \nM. is there a way to remove the closing paragraph of the VNS notification? \nVNS Project Manager I EOUSA I  Office of Legal Programs \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 7:55 AM \nToil \nSubject: Epstein 2018R01618 \nThe SDNY USA Geoffrey Berman wants a notice to go out with two paragraphs only.
