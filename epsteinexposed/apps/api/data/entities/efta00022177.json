Maybe in the paragraph I added at the end about checking ID's at the door? I think \nthis is an important point. \nFirst, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant's and Epstein's interactions with Minor Victim-3 were part \nof a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor victims with intent to commit illegal sex \nacts. \nEven if Minor Victim-3 was not \nultimately transported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to \nengage in criminal \nconduct; there is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. \nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not matter \nwhether Minor \nVictim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor,  or whether the elements of the substantive crimes of \ntransportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, November 7, 2021 10:00 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Decision on motion to strike \nSure thing.
