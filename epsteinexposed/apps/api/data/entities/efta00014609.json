He should have called the FBI number in your \npress release. Could you please forward this to your FBI agents and let them deal with it? If they get back to you \nand say they know him and he is a crazy, let me know that, and we will figure out his mailing address and send \nhim out the usual form letter from the Civilian Crime Reports Unit, with a form to fill out. And we will deal with \nhim if he continues to be a problem. But before we do that, in case this is useful, let the FBI hear it and let us \nknow whether to process it in the CCR system.
