As we \ndiscussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with redactions applied: (1) the Government's motion \nin limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply. \nPlease let us know if you would like us to add any redactions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to \nExhibits: \n•  We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A. \n•  Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without redactions. \n•  All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00025065",
