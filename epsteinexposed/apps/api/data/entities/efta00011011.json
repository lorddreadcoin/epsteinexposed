EPSTEIN, \n) \n) \nPROBATE NO. ST-19-PB-80 \no \ne\n-• \n) \n4--  \n7-.\n.73 \nDeceased. \n) \nACTION FOR TESTATE \n) \nADMINISTRATION \nrs,\nEXPEDITED \nMOTION \nFOR ESTABLISHMENT OF \nA VOLUNTARY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROGRAM \nCOME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the \"Estate\"), \nDARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, and move this \nHonorable Court for an \nexpedited order to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program (the \n\"Program\") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein, deceased, as \nmore fully described infra. As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the Program would provide all \neligible claimants an opportunity to receive \ncompensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of \nsexual abuse against \nMr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. \nTo be designed and implemented by independent, nationally recognized \nclaims administration \nexperts, \nwith input \nfrom interested parties including \nclaimants and their representatives, the \nProgram would seek to timely resolve these claims through a  process that is \nsensitive to the \nexperiences and concerns of \nclaimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nAs widely reported in the news media, multiple individuals have asserted or expressed their \nintent to assert claims of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (collectively, the \"Sexual Abuse Claims\"). \nTo date, twelve lawsuits involving Sexual Abuse Claims have been filed in the state and federal \ncourts of the State of New York, where claimants assert some of the complained-of conduct \noccurred, and which recently amended its statute of limitations to \npermit such claims.
