Introduction \nA. Affiant \n1. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (\"FBI\") since \n2017. During that time, I have \nparticipated in numerous investigations and prosecutions of crimes \nagainst children, including the sex trafficking of minors. I have also \nparticipated in the execution \nof \nmultiple search warrants. \n2. I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant \nto Rule 41 of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant \nto search the premises specified below (the \"Subject \nPremises\") \nfor the purpose of photographing, video-recording or otherwise \ndocumenting the \nappearance of its interior, and to seize the items and information \ndescribed in Attachment A. This \naffidavit is based upon my personal \nknowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and \nmy conversations with \nother law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted \nfor the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include \nall the facts that I have \nlearned during the course of my \ninvestigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, \nstatements, and \nconversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in \nsubstance and in \npart, except where otherwise indicated. \n20t7.08.02 \nEFTA00028500\n\nB. \nThe \nSubject \nPremises \n3. \nThe \nSubject \nPremises \nare \nparticularly \ndescribed \nas \na \nnearly \n19,000 \nsquare \nfoot \nmulti\n-story, \nsingle-family \nresidence \nlocated \nat \nNew \nYork, \nNew \nYork, \nand \ninclude \nall \nlocked \nand \nclosed \ncontainers \nfound \ntherein. \nAs \ndetailed \nfurther \nherein, \nthe \nSubject \nPremises \nis \nbelieved \nto \nbe \nowned, \npossessed \nand \ncontrolled \nby \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \na  \ntarget \nsubject \nof \nthis \ninvestigation. \nA \nphotograph \nof \nthe \nfront \nentrance \nto \nthe \nSubject \nPremises \nis \nincluded \nbelow: \nC. \nThe \nTarget \nSubject \nand \nthe \nSubject \nOffenses \n4. \nThe \nTarget \nSubject \nof \nthis \ninvestigation \nis \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN. \n5. \nFor \nthe \nreasons \ndetailed \nbelow, \nI \nbelieve \nthat \nthere \nis \nprobable \ncause \nto \nbelieve \nthat \nthe \nSubject \nPremises \ncontain \nevidence, \nfruits, \nand \ninstrumentalities \nof \nviolations \nof \nTitle \n18, \nUnited \nStates \nCode, \nSection \n1591 \n(sex \ntrafficking \nof \nminors) \nand \nTitle \n18, \nUnited \nStates \nCode, \nSection \n371 \n(sex \ntrafficking \nconspiracy) \n(the \n\"Subject \nOffenses\") \nby \nthe \nTarget \nSubject. \n2 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028501\n\nII. Probable \nCause \nA. Probable Cause Regarding the \nTarget Subject's Commission of the \nSubject Offenses \n6. On or \nabout July 2, 2019, a  grand jury in this District \nreturned an Indictment \ncharging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with the \nSubject Offenses. A copy of the Indictment is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated by reference. \nB. Probable Cause \nJustifying Search of the Subject Premises \n7. As set forth in \nExhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and \nincluding at least \nin or about 2005, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in the Southern \nDistrict of New York and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the \npresent, EPSTEIN \npossessed and controlled the Subject Premises, \nwhich is described in Exhibit A as \"the New York \nResidence.\" \n8. As further set forth in paragraphs 8 \nthrough 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or \nabout 2002, \nup to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused \nnumerous \nminor victims at the Subject Premises. In \nparticular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a \nvictim arrived at the Subject \nPremises, she would be escorted to a room inside the \nSubject Premises \nwith a \nmassage table, where she would perform a massage on \nEPSTEIN. The victims, who were \nas \nyoung as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or \nother individuals to partially or fully undress \nbefore beginning the \"massage.\" \nDuring the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and \nscope of physical \ncontact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts \nsuch as groping \nand direct and indirect contact with the \nvictims' genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also \nmasturbate during these \nsexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he \nmasturbated, \nand touch victims' \ngenitals with his hands or with sex toys. Following each \nencounter, EPSTEIN \nor \none of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. \n3 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028502\n\n9. As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of \nExhibit A, to further facilitate his ability \nto abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, asked and enticed certain \nof his victims to \nrecruit additional minor girls to perform \"massages\" and similarly engage in sex \nacts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both \nthe victim-recruiter and \nthe new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his \nvictims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age. \n10. One of \nthe victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of \nthe FBI's \ninvestigation of EPSTEIN, other law enforcement officers and I  have interviewed \nVictim-1.1  I know from my personal participation of interviews with Victim-1, my conversations \nwith other law enforcement officers who have \ninterviewed Victim-1, and my review of notes and \nreports of other interviews with Victim-1 that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in \nsubstance and in \npart: \na. Between \napproximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on \nmultiple occasions in the Subject Premises. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was \nunder the age of 18. \nb. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the Subject Premises \nand numerous individual rooms within the Subject Premises. \nVictim-1 has provided detailed \ndescriptions \nof certain aspects of \nthe interior \nof the Subject \nPremises, including Victim-1's \n1 In \nmeetings with the Government, Victim-1 has disclosed that, approximately a decade ago, she \ncommitted marriage fraud in order to obtain a green card and, subsequently, U.S. citizenship. She \nhas also disclosed personal substance abuse, primarily involving the \nabuse of prescription drugs, \nduring various periods between the \nearly 2000s and 2019. Victim-1 has also disclosed having \nworked for \napproximately a  year at a \"happy-ending\" massage parlor, performing paid sex acts. \nVictim-1 is currently \npursuing a civil damages claim against EPSTEIN for his sexual abuse of her. \nInformation provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent \nevidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of \nother victims whom Victim-1 has never met. \n4 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028503\n\nmemory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of \nvarious areas within the Subject Premises. \n11. I know from my review of publicly available corporate and property records that at \nall times relevant to the Subject Offenses as alleged in the Indictment, the Subject Premises was \nowned by Nine Fast 71st Street Corporation (the \"Corporation\"). The President of the Corporation \nis listed as JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and no other officers or occupants are identified on the \nCorporation paperwork. In or around December 2011, the Subject Premises was transferred from \nthe Corporation to another corporate entity, Maple, Inc., which is registered in the U.S. \nVirgin \nIslands, where EPSTEIN was then known to and continues to reside. Though no officer of Maple, \nInc., is identified in the transfer paperwork, the signature of both the buyer and seller in the \ntransaction appear to be the same. \nMoreover, the deed lists the consideration for the transfer of \nthe Subject Premises as $10, an amount facially inconsistent with a fair market transfer to a third \nParty-\n12. I  know from my participation in this investigation that EPSTEIN has continued to \npossess and control the Subject Premises from at least in or about 2002 to the present. In particular, \nI know from my review of Sex Offender Registration records that EPSTEIN presently lists the \nSubject Premises as one of his residences. Moreover, as described in paragraph 11, above, \nalthough ownership of Subject Premises was transferred from one corporate entity to another in \nDecember 2011, both corporations appear to be under EPSTEIN's \ncontrol, and EPSTEIN appears \nto \nremain the sole \nowner and \noccupant of the \nSubject Premises. \n13. Additionally, although Victim-1 has not been in the Subject Premises since in or \naround 2005, based on my review of publicly available records maintained by the New York City \nDepartment of Buildings (\"DOB\"), it  does not appear that there have been any significant or \n5 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028504\n\nstructural renovations to the interior of the Subject \nPremises since that time. In particular, the \nDOB reflects only three \napproved alteration permits for the Subject Premises, one in \nor around \n2011 which authorized \nfacade restoration but expressly noted that \nthere would be \"no change to \noccupancy, use egress or bulk,\" and two \npermitting the \"installation of heavy duty \nsidewalk shed\" \noutside of the \nSubject Premises at various points, but similarly \nnoting that there would be \"no \nchanges in use, egress or occupancy.\" As such, \nwhile it is possible that certain interior \ndecorations \nhave changed since 2005, it \nis probable that structural components of \nthe interior, such as \nVictim-I's description of the layout of rooms and floors, \namong other details, would remain the \nsame. \n6 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028505\n\nIII. \nConclusion and Ancillary Provisions \n14. Based on the \nforegoing, I respectfully submit that \nthere is probable cause to believe \nthat photographing, video-recording, and otherwise \ndocumenting the appearance of the interior of \nthe Subject Premises, and \nseizing the items described in Attachment A, will \nyield evidence of the \nSubject Offenses. In particular, evidence \ndepicting the interior of the Subject Premises and \nreflecting the occupancy, ownership, \nlayout, furnishings, decorations, and floor \npattern of the \nSubject Premises will corroborate \nVictim\n-1's \naccount of EPSTEIN's \ncommission of the Subject \nOffenses. I \nfurther submit that there is probable cause \nto believe that such evidence will be \nlocated \nwithin the Subject Premises \nand therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize \nthe items \nand information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the \nSearch and Seizure Warrant. \nSpecial \nAgent \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nSworn to before me on \n2019 \nTHE HONORABLE BARBARA MOSES \nUNITED STATES \nMAGISTRATE JUDGE \n7 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028506\n\nATTACHMENT A \nI.
