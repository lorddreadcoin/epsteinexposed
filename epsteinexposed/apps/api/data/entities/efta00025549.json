Thanks. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Pagones, Stephanie\" \n< \nDate: March 16, 2020 at 8:22:57 AM EDT \nTo: ' \nSubject: FOX Business inquiry \nHi, \nWe're working on a story in which we speak to several former federal prosecutors and US Attorneys about the potential \nnext steps in the Epstein investigation, particularly as it pertains to Prince Andrew's unwillingness to cooperate. \nOne of the things that has come up from multiple people is how unusual it is for Geoffrey Berman to have spoken \npublicly about this matter, not once, but twice. \nPer one former US Attorney: \"It's an unusual move because generally speaking, there is a rule, there's guidance in the \nU.S. attorney's manual that comes from the attorney general that indicates that they are not to comment.\" \nFull disclosure, in most, if not all cases, the people I spoke with said they would likely have done the same thing. \nThat said, would you or US Atty Berman like to provide any statement or comment to be induded in the story? \nWe are on deadline for 4 p.m. Monday. Thank you in advance, I hope to hear from you before then. \nStephanie Pagones \nDigital Reporter I FOX Business \ncell: \n#steph_pagones \nFOX\" \nBUSINESS \nThis message and its attachments may contain legally privileged or confidential information.
