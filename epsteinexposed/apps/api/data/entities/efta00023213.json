The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. \nPrevious requests to use this more ample corner mom have been denied because the officers' claim \nthe camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner room. \nI am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. \nThe previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. \nAlso, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below. \nPlease promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nTracking Number: \nEJ699436435US \nScheduled \nDelivery by \nTHURSDAY \n14 \nOCTOBER \n2021 0 \nby \n6:00pm 0 \nStatus \nAvailable for Pickup \nOctober 15. 2021 at 7:55 am \nBROOKLYN.
