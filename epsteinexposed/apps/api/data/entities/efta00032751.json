    "text": "\n\nLAW orFucts \nSCOTT A. SREBNICK, P.A. \nSCOTT A. SREBNICK' \n, \nALSO ADMITTED IN NEW YORK \nDecember 2, 2019 \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, \nNY 10007 \nRe: \nUnited States v. \nMichael \nAvenatti \nCase No. Si 19 Cr 373 (PGG) \nGentlemen: \n201 S. Biscayne Boulevard \nSalle 1210 \nMiami, Florida \n33131 \nTel 305-285-9019 \nFar 305-377-9937 \nsco0€'srcbnicklawcom \nwrite \nsubakklatecom \nOn behalf of Mr. Avenatti, we make the \nrequest below pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(EXi) and \nthe government's obligations under the Due Process Clause, Brady v.  Maryland, \n373 U.S. 83 \n(1963), \nGiglio v.  United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and their progeny. This request is meant to \ndirect the government's attention \nto specific evidence. It  is not intended to be a  substitute \nfor \ngeneral categories of evidence that the government is otherwise required to \nproduce under the Due \nProcess Clause and the above authorities (e.g., plea agreements, deferred \nprosecution agreements, \nnon-prosecution agreements, \npromises and benefits to witnesses, threatened \ncharges against \nwitnesses, etc.), all of which we request as well. \nOn Saturday, November 30, 2019, the New York Times (\"Times\") \npublished an \ninvestigative report entitled \"Jeffrey Epstein, \nBlackmail, and a Lucrative 'Hot List'.\" See \nhttns://www.nvtimes.com/2019/11/30/business/david-boies-pottinger-ieffrev -eostein-\nvideos.html.   The Times reported \nabout an agreement between David \nBoies, the founder of the \nBoies \nSchiller Flexner (\"BSF\") law firm and its Chairman and Managing Partner \nsince 1997, and \nattorney John Stanley Pottinger, to purchase what they believed to be \nvideos secretly made by \nJeffrey Epstein of \nfamous wealthy men engaged in sexual activities \nwith different women at \nEpstein's residence. The videos were supposedly in the \npossession of a man who identified himself \nto Boies as Patrick Kessler. Because \nthe videos were purportedly made at Epstein's \ndirection, \nBoles and Pottinger undoubtedly believed \nthat at least some of the videos constituted evidence of \nserious criminal sex offenses targeting minors. The \nTimes's reporting suggests that Boies and \nPottinger were plotting to use the videos \nto secure multi-million-dollar payoffs from these \nwealthy \nmen in exchange for confidentiality (i.e., concealing \nthe videos from law enforcement and the \npublic), in part by entering into agreements to be \nretained by the actual alleged abusers. The \nevidence further suggests that Boies had no \nidea whether any of his current clients (alleged Epstein \nvictims) were depicted in the videos, but \nthat did not matter to Boies because, as the Times \nEFTA00032751\n\nsuggests, even in the absence of clients, Boies and Pottinger were planning to \nutilize the illicit \nvideos to obtain multi-million-dollar settlements from the wealthy men. \nThis \nconduct was the subject of Episode 22 of The Weekly, a television series of the Times, \nwhich airs on FX and Hulu. Episode 22, which aired a few days ago, included interviews of Boies \nand \nPottinger. See \nhttos://www.nvtimes.com/2019/11/29/the-weekly/ieffrev-eostein-secret-\nvideos.html.  The interviews confirmed that the purpose of the plan was to get these wealthy men \nto pay money in exchange for what Boies described in his interview as \"peace.\" The \"peace\" \nmeant burying evidence of criminal conduct from the public (and presumably law enforcement). \nAs described, Mr. Boies's conduct \namounts to conspiracy to commit extortion, as \ninterpreted by the USAO-SDNY. In furtherance thereof (i. \ne., one of several overt acts), Boies and \nPottinger sought to enlist the assistance of the press as part of their scheme and invited reporters \nfrom the Times to meet Kessler at the \nBSF office in Manhattan. According to the Times, \"[tjhe \nthreat of [a) major news organization writing about the videos -  and confirming the existence of \nan extensive surveillance apparatus — could greatly enhance the lawyers' leverage over the wealthy \nmen.\" The conduct, as described, would appear to also violate other criminal statutes, including \n18 U.S.C. §§2252 and 2252A. Venue for this conduct plainly exists in the Southern District of \nNew York. \nAs you know, BSF lawyers were the ones who reported Mr. Avenatti's alleged scheme to \nextort Nike to federal law enforcement and the USAO-SDNY. Based on our prior conversations \nwith you, it is  clear that one or more BSF lawyers \nwill be witnesses at Mr. Avenatti's trial. \nEvidence that their boss and law partner David Boies may have engaged in the above-described \nconduct — and could potentially be prosecuted by the USAO-SDNY —  is highly relevant to  the \nmotives \nof the testifying BSF lawyers to curry favor with the government. After all, Boies is \nknown to be a chief rainmaker \nat the BSF firm and his reputation has been essential to the success \nof BSF. Indeed, if Boies were indicted for this conduct, the partners at BSF would surely suffer a \nsubstantial financial impact. \nAccordingly, we demand any evidence in the \npossession of the USAO-SDNY \npertaining to David Boies's conduct as described in the Times report and Episode 22 of The \nWeekly. We further demand disclosure of \nwhether Boies or any other members of his law \nfirm are under federal investigation for the \nconduct described in the Times report and The \nWeekly. And if not, \nwhy \nnot? \nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. \nRespectfully, \nSCOTT A. \nSREBNICK \nJOSE M. \nQUINON \nEFTA00032752",
