Touhy v.  Ragen, 340 U.S. \n462 (1951). We make this written request pursuant to the Touhy regulations codified as 28 C.F.R. \n§ 16.21 et seq. Should you find there to be any deficiencies within this request, please notify us \nand we will do what is necessary to correct any such shortcomings. \n• \nwas sexually assaulted by prolific pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, on two occasions in 2000, when \nshe was only 15 years old, record of which we believe is currently in the Government's possession \nas a  result of the investigation that was conducted into Epstein's criminal activity relating to the \nsexual abuse of minor children. Given the highly relevant nature of this tangible evidence to \ncurrently pending litigation, we request production of documentary evidence relating to \norder to enable her to prove her claims from both a liability and damages standpoint. \nin \n'  To protect her anonymity, our client has elected to proceed as a E. As such, we have referred to her \nherein using the pseudonym under which she has filed her lawsuit. To the extent that her identity is not \nalready known by the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, please contact us at your earliest \nconvenience to discuss her true identity. \nEFTA00023326\n\nPage 2 \nWe specifically seek copies of the following documents that we believe are currently in the \npossession of the Government: \nI) Photographs of.; \n2) Videos oft; \n3) Any and all correspondence between Jeffrey Epstein, his agents, or his employees, and E; \n4) Any and all documents including true \nname; \n5) Any and all lists including true name; and \n6) Any and all other documentary materials relating in any way to E. \nPursuant to the Touhy regulations set forth by the Department of Justice, the Deputy or Associate \nAttorney General assesses the following considerations in determining whether disclosure is \nwarranted: \n(a)( I ) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure \ngoverning the case or mater in which the demand arose; \n(a)(2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of \nprivilege. This request satisfies both of these considerations.

Furthermore, this request does not seek \ninformation that is classified or that would reveal the source or identity of any informant. To that \neffect, E specifically does not request any investigatory records compiled for law enforcement \npurposes that would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. U simply requests \ninformation in the Government's possession that will assist in the prosecution of her claims and \nultimately, aid in her ability to finally obtain thejEstice that she deserves.
