Do you guys have a different view? \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 9:57 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: MCC discovery/notes \nI \nthink we haven't produced it previously, as removed everything that we had already produced. While I don't see a \nharm in producing this 302, I wonder if it opens us up to having to produce more of the Epstein case file or whether we \ncan rationally limit it since it discusses suicidality. Thoughts? \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, October 01, 2020 9:56 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) <> \nSubject: RE: MCC discovery/notes \nI've never seen those notes before and it's not my handwriting —  they came from MCC? Maybe they are Lt. ? I \nwould check with on that to make sure it's not her handwriting. \nI remember seeing this 302, but I don't remember where — I don't have a memory of producing it, but I could be wrong. \n=should be able to tell if we produced it previously). MI and I never had access to the Epstein shared and never got \nor produced the underlying case files. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 9:51 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS)<> \nSubject: MCC discovery/notes \nIn reviewing additional documents for the latest MCC discovery production, I found these notes of an interview labeled \n\"Unknown?' Any idea who this might be? Also, FBI provided us with a supplemental 302 about Epstein's arrest. Do you \nknow if we produced the original 302 about Epstein's arrest? \nThanks I \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00026565",
