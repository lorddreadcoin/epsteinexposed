I am attaching the press release that just went out. I will call but then be out of touch inside the \ninstitution for a  bit. If you need to reach me, contact Control at \nThank you, \nSupervisory Staff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetro olitan Correctional Center \nNew York, New York   10007 \n>>> \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:48, \n>  8/10/2019 10:48 AM > » \nWhat's a good number to call you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43 AM, \n> \nwrote: \nwrote: \nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing \ninformation in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible \nthe very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was \nreported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can \nhave a  call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have \nless information than the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nEFTA00019757\n\n• \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 08:46 >  wrote: \nPassed away.
