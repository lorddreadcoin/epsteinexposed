    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nDate: \nSubject: \n12112+2019 3:05 PM \nNYT FOIA to BOP, Epstein logs \nHi. I am enclosing a FOIA request. below. Please let me know if I can be of \nany help in explaining this or narrowing it. \nMany thanks, \nDanielle \nDanielle Ivory \nReporter \nThe New York Times \n620 Eighth Avenue \nNcw York, NY 10018 \nOffice phone: \nMobile phone: \nEmail: \nCkc.12,2019 \nBureau of Prisons \nFREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST \nDear FOIA Officer \nRequested records \n\"Records\" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten. \ntyped, electronic or otherwise produced. reproduced or stored), letters, \nmemoranda. correspondence, notes, applications, completed forms, studies, \nreports, reviews. telephone conversations, faxes. emails. documents, \nphotographs minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any \nother compilation of data from which information can be obtained. All of \nthe foregoing are included in this request if they are in the possession of \nor otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following \ntype in the possession, custody, or control of OSHA. \nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq \n(\"FOIA\"), I request copies of (or access to) documents about Jeffrey \nEpstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on Aug. 10, \n2019, specifically (hereafter described as - the records\"): \n(1) The full log of Mr. Epstein's phone calls to and from the MCC. \n(2) All email correspondence to and from Mr. Epstein while he was at the \nMCC (including any correspondence through the Corrlinks system or any other \nemail system he had access to.) \nEFTA00023428\n\n(3) The full log of people who visited Mr. Epstein while he was at the MCC \nand when they visited. \n(4) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his \napproved visitor list. \n(5) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his \napproved email correspondence list. \n(6) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his \napproved call list. \nThe Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey \nEpstein is listed in the BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey \nEpstein should not be a problem for the bureau. For this request, records \ngenerated by BOP employees based in New York, Texas, and in Washington, DC, \nshould be searched. \nI am a reporter for The Ncw York Times, an accredited and recognized \nnewsgathering organization. I request the Records to inform the public \nabout matters of public concern. \nONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS/INVESTIGATIONS \nAs to any records located in the investigative files of pending \ninvestigations, you may not assert Exemption 7(A) without conducting a \ndocument-by-document review to determine whether release of the records \nwould interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. \nThe United States District Coun of the District of Columbia recently \n- reminel(ed) the FBI of its obligation to conduct record-level reviews at \nthe administrative level before refusing to produce records contained in \nits investigative files.-- Tipognph v. Dept of Justice, 83 F. Supp. 2d 234 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2015) \nIn addition, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 added a provision instructing \nfederal agencies to withhold records only when their release would work \nsome foreseeable or is prohibited by law, not just because they may \ntechnically be exempt. \nEven if the records might otherwise be exempt, an agency may withhold them \nonly if their disclosure would actually harm the interest protected by the \nexemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 U.S.0 552(a)(8). The \nagency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow \nfrom release of the information being withheld, consider partial disclosure \nof the information, take reasonable steps to segregate and release \nnonexempt information. \nRESPONSE TIME \nFOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business \ndays. This request is segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire \nrecords because of one section that you believe is exempt from disclosure. \nUnder federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records \nfrom disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and \nlegal basis for withholding any part of the Records. \nESTIMATED DATE OF COMPLETION \nI respectfully request that you provide me with a reasonably estimated date \nof completion. Sec 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7XBXii). If the estimated date of \ncompletion is being significantly delayed because of a portion of the \nrequest needs to be processed by another agency, please inform me which \nagency that is and whether it has provided you with an estimated date of \ncompletion. \nEFTA00023429\n\nFORMAT OF REQUESTED RECORDS \nI am further requesting that the Records be provided to me on computer \nfiles in the same format as they are currently maintained at the agency. \npursuant to Burka v. Dept. of Health & Human Svcs., 87 F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. \n1996). As you know, providing documents electronically is cheaper than \nmailing hard copies. \nFEE WAIVER \nI respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this \nrequest as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(aX4XAXiii). FOIA was designed to \nprovide citizens a broad right to access government records. FOIA's basic \npurpose is to \"open agency action to the light of public scrutiny,\" with a \nfocus on the public's - right to be informed about what their government is \nup to.\" U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 \nU.S. 749, 773-74 (1989) (internal quotation and citations omitted). In \norder to provide public access to this information. FOIA's fee waiver \nprovision requires idlocuments shall be furnished without any charge or at \na [reduced] charge ... disclosure of the information is in the public \ninterest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public \nunderstanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not \nprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" 5 U.S.C. § \n552(aX4)(AXiii). \nEXPEDITED PROCESSING \nThere is extreme public interest in records concerning the prison stay and \ndeath of Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexually abusing scores of \nwomen and underage girls. Not only has a person died in federal custody. \nbut the death has generated multiple theories implicating government works \nat the highest levels and taxpayer money. Disclosure of the records request \nis in the public interest because disclosure is likely to contribute \nsignificantly to the understanding of the operations or activities of the \ngovernment. In addition, as one of the largest circulation newspapers in \nthe United States, The New York Times plays an important role in sharing \ninformation with the public and helping the public understand how the \nfederal government works. Disclosure of the records is not primarily in \nthe commercial interest of myself or The New York Times but is intended to \nfacilitate reporting on the operations of government. \nPlease contact me if I may assist in your office's response to this request. \nYours. \nDanielle Ivory \nDanielle Ivory \nThe New York Times \nOffice: \nCell: \nFax: \nSignal encrypted chat: \nEFTA00023430",
