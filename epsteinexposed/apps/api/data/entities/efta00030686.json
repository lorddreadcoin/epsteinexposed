Maxwell \nCase Number: \nI :20-cr-00330-AJN \nFiler: \nDocument Number:92 \nDocket Text: \nORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC \nlegal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 \nletter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal \ncounsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden \nHeriberto Tellez to personally respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's \nconditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, \nalong with the MDC legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's \nrequest to summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves \nDkt. No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall \ncontinue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of \nMs. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, \nincluding legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The \nupdates shall also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. The \nCourt hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 days. \nFurthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant \ncontinues to receive adequate access to. legal materials and her ability to communicate \nwith defense counsel.
