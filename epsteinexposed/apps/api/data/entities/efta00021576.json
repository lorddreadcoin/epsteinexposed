If it's possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni's birthday, and see if it matches up with the date \non the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native \ncountry with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein's photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein's mansion?? Given \nthe time pressure I think it's totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y'all. \nThank you!! \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00021577",
