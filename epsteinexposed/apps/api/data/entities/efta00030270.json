Could you guys do a \nsuper quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today —  sorry \nfor the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). \nAlso, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC —  please send it back to me. \nThanks, \nEFTA00030270",
