To respond to your question generally, in \nconnection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to \nrequest a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire \nabout his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that \nhave arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. \nAlthough we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law \nenforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has \nlegal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance. \nCertainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as \na threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Gary Bloxsome \nSent: Friday, January 03, 2020 10:30 \nTo: \nCc: \n) \n>; Jennifer Richardson \nSubject: Re: U.S. Department of Justice investigation \nDear Sirs, \nThank you for your email dated 2 January 2020. \nI confirm that we do represent HRH the Duke of York. \nI would be grateful if you could please clarify what specifically you invite us to contact you about. \nKind regards \nGary Bloxsome \nGary Bloxsome \n[Partner \nBlackfords LIP \nI www.blackfords.com \nr , \n-:nership registered in England & !nith registered number \nA list of members' names is available at this \naddress. \nGDPR: details of how we handle personal data can be found in ourPrIvacy Statement \n; Daniel Cundy \nEFTA00023815\n\nAuthorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority under number 462078. \nOn 2 Jan 2020, at 18:54, ‹> wrote: \nExternal email: is it safe to open attachments and links? \nMr. Bloxsome, \nWe are the federal prosecutors investigating conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein, under the U.S. Department of \nJustice, Southern District of New York.
