The hearing originally was scheduled for Friday. \nSources have confirmed that the deal will put Epstein in prison for 18 months, followed by \nhouse arrest. \n\"The plea conference will be moved to March, but it will be resolved, we believe,\" attorney \nGerald Lefcourt said by phone. \nAlthough he declined to give a reason, Lefcourt said the date change was agreed to by both \nthe defense and the prosecution. \nMike Edmondson, spokesman for State Attorney Barry Krischer, declined to comment. \n\"It's a matter of policy we don't comment on active cases,\" Edmondson said. \nIn exchange for his guilty plea, federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into \nwhether Epstein broke any federal laws, sources have said. \nEpstein, 54, was indicted in July 2006 on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution. After \ncompleting an 11-month investigation, Palm Beach police said Epstein paid five underage \ngirls for massages and sometimes sex at his El Brillo Way home. \nThe investigation began after police received a call from a woman who said her 14-year-old \nstepdaughter might have been molested by a man in Palm Beach. \nInvestigators watched Epstein's 7,234-square-foot waterfront home and private jet, and \nrummaged through his trash to build their case. They took sworn statements from five alleged \nvictims and 17 witnesses. \nhttp://cox.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action—cptectitle—Jeffrey+Epstein+plea+hearing+... 1/3/2008 \nEFTA00013546\n\nJeffrey Epstein plea hearing moved to March Page 2 of 2 \nFind this article at: \nhttp://www.palmbeachdailynews.cominews/content/news/epstein0103.html \nr  Check the box to include the list of links referenced in the article. \nCopyright 2007 Palm Beach Daily News.
