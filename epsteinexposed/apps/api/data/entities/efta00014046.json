The United \nStates shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a  list of \nindividuals whom it has identified as victims, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2255, after Epstein has signed \nthis agreement and been sentenced. \nUpon the execution of this \nagreement, the United States, in consultation \nwith and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, shall \nselect an attorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for \nby Epstein.

Epstein \nshall use his best efforts to \nenter his guilty plea and \nbe \nPage 4 of 7 \nEFTA00014049\n\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2007.

At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to \nprovide an \naccounting of the gain time he earned during his period of \nincarceration. \n13. The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any \npublic record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information \nAct request or any compulsory process \ncommanding the disclosure of \nthe \nagreement, it  will provide notice to Epstein before making that \ndisclosure. \nEpstein understands that the \nUnited States Attorney has no authority \nto require the \nState Attorney's Office to abide \nby any terms of this agreement. Epstein \nunderstands that \nit  is his obligation \nto undertake discussions with the \nState Attorney's Office and to \nuse his \nbest efforts to ensure \ncompliance with these procedures, \nwhich compliance will be \nnecessary \nto satisfy the \nUnited States' interest. \nEpstein also understands that it \nis his obligation to use \nhis best \nefforts to convince the \nJudge of the 15th Judicial \nCircuit to accept \nEpstein's binding \nrecommendation \nregarding the sentence to \nbe \nimposed, and understands that the \nfailure to \ndo so will be \na breach of \nthe agreement. \nIn consideration of \nEpstein's agreement to plead \nguilty and to provide \ncompensation \nin the manner described \nabove, if \nEpstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions \nof this agreement, \nthe United States \nalso agrees that it will \nnot institute any \ncriminal char cs \n• \n\" \ning but not \nlimited \nto \nFurther, upon execution of this \nagreement \nand a \nplea \nagreement with the State \nAttorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury \ninvestigation will be \nsuspended, and all pending \nfederal Grand Jury \nsubpoenas will be held \nin \nabeyance unless and until \nthe defendant \nviolates any term of this \nagreement. The \ndefendant \nlikewise agrees to withdraw \nhis pending motion to \nintervene and to quash \ncertain \ngrand jury \nsubpoenas. Both \nparties \nagree to maintain their \nevidence, specifically evidence \nrequested by \nor \ndirectly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have \nbeen issued, and \nincluding \ncertain computer \nequipment, inviolate until all \nof the terms of this \nagreement have \nbeen \nsatisfied. Upon the \nsuccessful completion of the \nterms of this \nagreement, all \noutstanding grand jury \nsubpoenas shall \nbe deemed \nwithdrawn. \nPage 5 \nof 7 \nEFTA00014050\n\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is \nmaterial to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach \nof any one of \nthese \nconditions allows the United \nStates to elect to \nterminate the agreement \nand \nto investigate and prosecute \nEpstein and any other \nindividual or entity \nfor any and all \nfederal offenses. \nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies \nthat he is aware of the fact that \nthe Sixth Amendment \nto the Constitution of the United \nStates \nprovides that in all criminal \nprosecutions the \naccused shall enjoy the \nright to a \nspeedy and \npublic \ntrial. Epstein further \nis aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court \nmay \ndismiss an \nindictment, information, or \ncomplaint \nfor \nunnecessary \ndelay in presenting \na charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein \nhereby requests that \nthe \nUnited States \nAttorney for the \nSouthern District of \nFlorida \ndefer such \nprosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to \nthe date of \ninitiation of \nprosecution, as provided for \nin the \nterms expressed herein, shall be \ndeemed to be a \nnecessary \ndelay at his own request, and he hereby waives \nany defense to such \nprosecution on the ground that such delay \noperated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of \nthe Federal \nRules \nof \nCriminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment \nto the Constitution of the \nUnited States to a speedy \ntrial or to \nbar the prosecution by reason of the \nrunning of the statute \nof \nlimitations for a \nperiod of months \nequal to the period between the \nsigning of this \nagreement and \nthe breach of \nthis agreement as \nto those offenses \nthat were \nthe subject of the \ngrand \njury's \ninvestigation. Epstein \nfurther asserts and certifies \nthat he understands \nthat the \nFifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that \nall \nfelonies must \nbe charged in an \nindictment \npresented to a \ngrand jury. \nEpstein hereby agrees \nand \nconsents \nthat, if a \nprosecution against him is \ninstituted for any offense that was the \nsubject of the grand \njury's \ninvestigation, \nit may be by \nway of an \nInformation signed and filed \nby the \nUnited \nStates \nAttorney, and \nhereby waives his \nright to be indicted \nby a grand jury as \nto \nany such \noffense. \n/// \n/// \n/// \nPage 6 of 7 \nEFTA00014051\n\nBy \nsigning this \nagreement, Epstein \nasserts \nand \ncertifies \nthat the above has \nbeen read \nand explained to him. \nEpstein \nhereby \nstates that he understands \nthe \nconditions of this Non-\nProsecution Agreement \nand agrees to \ncomply with them. \nR.
