    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nSubject: FW: Requests \nDate: Thu, 09 Jul 2020 14:30:49 +0000 \nAttachments: Hot_lists.pdf \nThe attached is what BOP provided in response to our request for \"hot lists.\" What do you think about producing? It \nseems to have a lot of confidential information about other inmates, and Epstein was never placed on this list. One \npossible response is just to say that Epstein was never placed on the list. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, June 24, 2020 9:08 AM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: Requests \nfyi \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, June 24, 2020 8:44 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Requests \nHere are a few more things from your request. I have been unable to locate any watch calls or SROs from the requested \ntime frame. I will continue to look for those documents. I have been told SROs were likely not completed during that time \nand also that most of the Control Center paperwork (originals), to include watch call sheets, were seized by the FBI and/or \nOIG shortly after the incident, and therefore are no longer in the institution. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance. \n>>> \nThank you, my brother! \n> 06/23/20 3:55 PM >>> \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, June 23, 2020 3:53 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Requests \nI've attached all the documentation I have pertaining to the below request.
