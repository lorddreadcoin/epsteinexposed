Making progress. and I interviewed two witnesses on Friday at the BSF office in Fort \nLauderdale. The third witness we were supposed to interview decided not to come at the last minute, because she \ndecided she didn't want to be involved in the case after all this time has passed. She was not someone we were focused \non at this stage, so while we may circle back at another time to see if she comes in, right now it's fine. \nWe had a call with an attorney who represented FL victims a decade ago, and we're coordinating with him to schedule \nfollow up interviews with two of the witnesses who were approached and said they weren't sure how the civil case their \nlawyer handled affected if they could talk to us. \nhad a  call with Robbie Kaplan right before the trip, and the upshot is we are making baby steps towards an interview \nwith . They are concerned about her exposure, so we are discussing ways of addressing that, and the next \nstep will likely be an attorney proffer. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, March 24, 2019 3:40 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein \nHow did the rest of the trip go? \nDeputy Chief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nTel. \n>; \nEFTA00015003",
