GIUFFRE, \nPlaintiff, \n-against-\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nDefendant. \nNo. 15 Civ. \n7433 \n(LAP) \nMEMORANDUM \n& \nORDER \nLORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior \nUnited States District Judge: \nThe Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's letter \nrequesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision \nto unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's \ndepositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting from, quoting \nfrom, or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. \nno. 1078.) \nMs. Maxwell's eleventh-hour request for reconsideration is \ndenied. \nAs Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration \nis an \"extraordinary remedy.\" In re Beacon Assocs. Litig.,  818 F. \nSupp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. \nInc. Sec. Litig.,  113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)).  Such \nmotions \n\"are \nproperly granted \nonly if there is a showing of: (1) \nan intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of \nnew evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent \nmanifest \ninjustice.\" Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Grp., Inc.,  818 F. \nSupp. 2d 678, 696 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2011). \"A motion \nfor reconsideration \n1 \nEFTA00024875\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 2 \nof 4 \nmay not be  used to  advance new facts, issues or arguments not \npreviously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle \nfor \nrelitigating \nissues already decided by the \nCourt.\" Bennett v. \nWatson Wyatt & Co.,  156 F. \nSupp.2d 270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). \nHere, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her \nassertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, \nprovide \ncompelling reasons for keeping \nthe deposition \ntranscripts \nsealed. (See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) But, despite Ms. \nMaxwell's \ncontention that she could not address the effect of those events \nin her objections because they occurred after the close of \nbriefing, (id.), 1  this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original \nobjection \nto  unsealing, Ms. Maxwell \nargued that the \nspecter of \nongoing criminal investigations into unknown individuals \nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes \nMs. Maxwell\n--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing \n1  The Court notes as  a  practical matter that Ms. Maxwell was \narrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's \nJuly 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent \nthat they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in \nthe \nunsealing \nprocess, the issues that \nMs. \nMaxwell raises in her \nrequest were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. \nMs. Maxwell, however, did \nnot seek to supplement her objections to \nunsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified \nthe parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing \ndecision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with \nother documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) Even then, Ms. \nMaxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. \nMs. Maxwell \ndid \nnot raise her \n\"vastly \ndifferent position,\" \n(Transcript of July 23 Ruling at 16:2-3), \nuntil moments after the \nCourt had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents. \n2 \nEFTA00024876\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 3 of 4 \nprocess. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, specifically \nMs. Maxwell's concern that unsealing would \"inappropriately \ninfluence \npotential \nwitnesses or \nalleged victims,\" (id.), and \nher \nreference to \"publicly reported statements by \nPlaintiff, \nPlaintiff's counsel, \nDistrict of New York, \nIslands\" about those \nthe United States Attorney for the Southern \nand the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin \ninvestigations, (id.), carried with it the \nclear implication that \nMs. Maxwell could find herself subject to \ninvestigation and, eventually, indictment. The Court understood \nthat implication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already \nconsidered any role that criminal \ncharges against Ms. Maxwell might \nplay in rebutting the presumption \nof public access to the sealed \nmaterials. Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the \nCourt's July 23 ruling is accordingly denied. \nGiven the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for \nreconsideration, \nthe \nCourt \nwill \nstay the unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's \nand Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order \nor  paper that quotes from or  discloses information from those \ndeposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through \nFriday, July \n31, \n2020, so that Ms. Maxwell \nmay seek \nrelief from \nthe Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from \nor disclose \nunsealed on \nOrder dated \ninformation from those deposition transcripts shall be \nJuly 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's \nJuly \n28, 2020.
