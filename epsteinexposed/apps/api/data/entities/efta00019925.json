You're correct that we didn't need his testimony. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, November 30, 2020 9:51 AM \nTo \nSubject: Efrain Reyes \nust learned from Probation that Efrain Reyes died. It sounds like it was in his sleep. Given his history, I \nthink it may have been drug related, but perhaps not. Either way, my recollection is that you didn't expect to need him for \nanything Epstein/MCC-related, but just want to keep you in the loop in case my memory is wrong. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019925",
