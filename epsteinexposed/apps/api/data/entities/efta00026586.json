Our team is \nplanning to get tested tomorrow in order to make sure we have results before flying, but please let us know as soon as \nyou can if that timing is a problem for some reason. \nIn addition, my cell phone number i and my phone will be working while I'm traveling.

We want to make sure your client is as comfortable as possible. It would be \nvery useful to our investigation to have more members of our team present for the interviews, but we will of course \ndefer to her comfort level. Let's discuss on our call tomorrow and make a final plan for the interviews then. \nThe process on our end does not require that we be tested before we depart. and I are asymptomatic, have never \nbeen symptomatic, and have not come into contact with anyone who was symptomatic or a  known carrier, so we have \nnot been tested. That said, if you/your client would like us to get tested before we leave the U.S., there is a clinic near \nour office that has been able to provide results within a day or two, so we could go there to get tested this week. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Jill Greenfield \nSent: Monday, October 5, 2020 6:18 AM \nTo: \nCc: Louise Scott a> \nSubject: RE: Epstein [FFW-DOCS.FID6003375] \nHi \nI spoke to my client over the weekend.
