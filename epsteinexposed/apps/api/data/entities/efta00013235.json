The productions look good to me but I do have one \nquestion. The drive that we sent to be uploaded contained about 41,000 files. In these two productions I only see a total \nof about 22,000. Is that because there are some natives that couldn't be imaged and are thus not viewable on the \ndatabase? \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Friday, October 9, 2020 3:10 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nHello, \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \n-(USANYS) \nAll of the documents from this production has been bates stamped an is now available in Relativity for review.
