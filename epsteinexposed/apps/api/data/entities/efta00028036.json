I was not able to check stuff like the \ndocket numbers or citations to previous briefs or motions in this case. That said the case cites look good overall, if there is \nany other way I can help or if there is something you want me to go back and check again just let me know. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 2021 12:44 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Cite Check \n(USANYS) < \nThanks. If you come across cites that you can't check because you don't have access to the document, just highlight it and \nI'll check it at the end. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 2021 12:43 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Cite Check \nGot it, will check in at 3:30 then. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 2021 12:42 PM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Cite Check \n>*, \n>; \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) < \nThanks, !  Our filing is due today, so the sooner the better.
