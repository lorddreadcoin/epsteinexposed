Feds: Oh Yes, We Did \nDate: Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:24:46 +0000 \nPrince Andrew and the FBI were involved in a furious war of words \nTuesday, after he \ndenied claims made by \nthe U.S. attorney for Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, that he \nhas refused to cooperate with \nAmerican authorities investigating Jeffrey Epstein's \nalleged sexual abuse. \nAndrew said no request had been received, and he was \nready to \ntalk. \nHowever a spokesperson for Berman's office told \nThe \nDaily Beast they stood by the prosecutor's comments, \nEFTA00016822\n\nspecifically the claim \nthat they had \"made several \nattempts to contact\" Andrew's representatives. \nAndrew, 59, \nhowever, was said to be \"angry and \nbewildered,\" according to The Daily 'IgILaO, \nat allegations made by Berman. \nOn Monday, \nBerman called out Andrew for  giving  \"zero \nco-operation\" to the investigation into Epstein at a \npress conference held outside Epstein's infamous front \ndoor. \nEFTA00016823\n\n\"Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth,\" a source \ndescribed as \"close to\" Andrew \ntold The Telegraph, \n\"The Duke is more than happy to talk to the FBI but he \nhasn't been approached by them yet. \n\"He is angry about the way this is being portrayed and \nbewildered as to why \nthis was said in New York. It \nseems certain people are \njumping the gun.\" \nHowever law-enforcement sources were adamant that \nEFTA00016824\n\nthey \"stood by\" Berman's \nremarks. \nBerman said he was taking the rare step of calling \nAndrew out by \nname because Andrew himself, in his \ndisastrous \nNewsnight interview, had said: \"I am willing \nto help any appropriate law-enforcement agency with \ntheir investigations, if \nrequired.\" \nWhile many observers saw Berman's remarks as a \ndesperate (and likely unsuccessful) attempt to shame \nPrince Andrew into living up to his earlier vow, Duncan \nLevin, a former federal and New York state prosecutor \nin the Manhattan DA's office, saw something \nelse: \nevidence of the authorities' determination to leave no \nEFTA00016825\n\nstone unturned as they go after the rich and powerful \nglobal network which Epstein cultivated. \nLevin, who is now a managing partner at Tucker Levin, \nPLLC, told The Daily Beast that while it was \"highly \nunusual for a prosecutor to make a public \nstatement \nabout a witness's reluctance to \ncooperate with law \nenforcement\" there \nis \"nothing usual about this case, in \nany way. Prince Andrew is not \nyour typical witness, by \nany \nstretch of the imagination.\" \nPublic Affairs \nUnited States Department of Justice \nU.S. Attorney's Office [Southern District of New York \nMobile I  Press Office: (212) 637-1020 \nEFTA00016826",
