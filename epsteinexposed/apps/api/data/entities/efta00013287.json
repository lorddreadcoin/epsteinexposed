Efrain Reyes \n18-cr-454 \nDear Judge Failla: \nMEMO ENDORSED \nI respectfully write as a member of the public and reporter for the New York Daily News \ncovering the case of US v. Reyes, 18-cr-454. \nI write in regard to Reyes's change of plea hearing on 8/26/19 and sentencing on 4/13/20. \nI'm told the transcripts of both proceedings are under seal. There are also no sentencing \nsubmissions from the government or Reyes's attorney posted on the docket. \nReyes died last month at his mother's apartment in the Bronx. He is the subject of public \ninterest because he was the last person to share a cell with Jeffrey Epstein. \nAs you are aware, there exists a presumption of access to court proceedings and judicial \ndocuments under both the common law and our Constitution. This presumption is overcome \nsolely when Your Honor makes a specific finding on the record that a compelling interest in \nsecrecy overrides this interest. Any restrictions of access must be narrowly tailored. \n\"The public and press have a qualified First Amendment right of access to plea and sentencing \nproceedings.\" United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d 189, 191-2 (2d Cir. 2005). \nThe presumption of access is based on the view that secrecy erodes trust in courts and judges, \nand access enhances trust. To keep these materials sealed would create the appearance that \nthe presumption is designed to avoid -- that the Court is keeping a matter of public concern \nunder wraps. \nI respectfully request that your Honor unseal the proceedings mentioned above and order the \ndocketing of sentencing submissions for Reyes. Alternatively, I ask you make a finding on the \nrecord explaining why they should remain under wraps. \nThank you for your attention. \nStephen Rex Brown \nNY DAILY \nNEWS \n1 \nEFTA00013287\n\nCase 1:18-cr-00454-KPF Document 306 Filed 12/29/20 Page 2 of 2 \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to file this letter to the docket in \ncase number 18-cr-454-12, United States v. Efrain Reyes. The parties \nshall file a \nresponse, if any, to this letter seeking to unseal \ncertain filings on or by January 22, 2021. \nDated: December 29, 2020 \nSO \nORDERED. \nNew York, New York \nVfita;., \n6,1/4\nHON.
