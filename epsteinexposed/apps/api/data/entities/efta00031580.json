Ghislaine Maxwell. 20 Cr. 330 (AIN): In July 2020, Maxwell was charged in a six-count indictment with \nfacilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The charges \nresulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators, \nincluding Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to \nengage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, and she even \ntook part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to \nEpstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and \nsubjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in \nillegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. Then, in an effort to cover \nup her crimes, the defendant lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with \nminor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, \nand the Court has denied two separate bail motions, most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July \n2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021.
