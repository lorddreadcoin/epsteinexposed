I put together the start of a letter (attached) based on your notes in the \ncalendar invite and some other additions, but of course I imagine this may change based on our convo with counsel. \nFrom: Laura Menninger \nSent: Wednesday, April 28, 2021 6:13 PM \nTo: \n) \nBobbi Sternheim 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' Jeff Pagliuca \nCc: \nMark S. Cohen \n)4S \nSubject: RE: US v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - meet and confer \n(USANYS)\nThanks for reaching out. We probably are best served by sending you our position on defense disclosures by email. We \nshould be able to send that by Friday and can schedule a time to talk thereafter if you wish, with an eye towards the joint \nfiling on Monday. \nWe will confer with the team on the Speedy Trial issue and also get back to you on that. \nLastly, do you want to discuss anything regarding Mr. Manley's application to the Court? I believe we are to discuss and \nthen you are to write the Court by Friday. I am free tomorrow afternoon to discuss if you wish. \nThanks, \nLaura \nLaura A. Menninger I Partner \nHaddon. Morgan & Foreman, P.C. \nFrom: \nc\n› \nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 2021 10:22 PM \nTo: Bobbi Sternheim \n< \n; 'BOBBI C \nSTERNHEIM' \nCc: \n) \n; Laura Menninger \n< >; \nJeff Pagliuca \nMark S. Cohen \nSubject: US v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - meet and confer \nCounsel, \n(USANYS) \nPer Judge Nathan's Order (docket number 250), is there a time this week when you would be available for a call to meet \nand confer regarding a proposed schedule for defense disclosure of witness statements pursuant to Rule 26.2? Or if you \nEFTA00022486\n\nwould prefer to confer by email, would you please let us know your position? \nAdditionally, we intend to submit a letter to Judge Nathan requesting that time under the Speedy Trial Act be excluded \nthrough the date the Court intends to set for trial of Counts One through Six of the 52 Indictment. Although Judge Nathan \npreviously excluded time through July 12, 2021, she has not reissued such an order since the return of the 52 Indictment, \nand, of course, the date of trial may change. We therefore intend to seek a clarifying order excluding time, both in light of \nthe still-pending suppression motion, which automatically excludes time, and in the interests of justice to allow for trial \npreparation. Would you please let us know whether you consent to the exclusion? \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00022487",
