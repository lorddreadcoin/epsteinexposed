    "text": "\n\nU.S. \nDepartment of \nJustice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n86 Chambers Street \nNew York. New York 10007 \nJanuary 6, 2020 \nBy Electronic Mail and U.S. Mail \nRoberta A. Kaplan \nKa Ian Hecker & Fink LLP \nNew York, NY 10118 \nRe: Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Ms. Kaplan: \nI am the Assistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\") who will be handling the request you \ndiscussed with AUSA for certain information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Because \nyour request seeks information from Department of Justice (the \"Department\") employees \nacquired as part of their performance of their official duties, your request is governed by certain \nDepartment regulations—commonly referred to as Touhy regulations—which, inter alia, prohibit \nany Department employee from disclosing such information \"without prior approval of the \nproper Department official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this part.\" 28 C.F.R. § \n16.22(a); see also United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 \net seq. The \"proper official\" in this case is Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for \nthe Southern District of New York. The Touhy regulations provide a set of procedures for the \nUnited States Attorney to follow when considering such requests. See 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.22(b), \n16.24. \nA party seeking to obtain records or employee testimony from the Department must first \nsubmit a written demand. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.22. To assist the United States Attorney in \nevaluating your request, we ask that this demand provide a detailed statement of the information \nsought; the litigation for which you seek this information; the pertinence of the information \nsought to your litigation; and the availability (or absence) of means in that litigation, including \ndiscovery, to obtain the information in question. See id. § 16.22(d). \nThe U.S. Attorney will reach a determination regarding your request in light of the \nconsiderations codified at 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.24, 16.25, and 16.26. Such considerations include, \ninter alia, \"[w]hether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the \ncase or matter in which the demand arose,\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1), and \"[w]hether disclosure is \nappropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege,\" including law enforcement \nprivilege. 28 C.F.R. § I6.26(a)(2). Disclosure will not be made when, inter alia, \"[d]isclosure \nwould violate a statute ... or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule,\" 28 U.S.C. \n§ 16.26(b)(I), \"[d]isclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant,\" 28 U.S.C. § \n16.26(b)(4), or \"[d]isclosure would reveal investigative records compiled for law enforcement \npurposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative \ntechniques,\" 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(5). Applying these considerations, the Department will make \nappropriate disclosures when warranted. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(c). \nEFTA00022146\n\nPage 2 \nMy understanding is that you may intend to make a formal written request pursuant to the \nabove-described regulations. If you choose to submit a written request, please send it directly to \nme. We will act upon an application made pursuant to the Department's regulations. \nPlease contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to \ndiscuss the issues herein further. \nSincerely, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nBy\nAssistant United States Attorne \nTelephone \nFacsimile: \nE-mail: \nEFTA00022147",
