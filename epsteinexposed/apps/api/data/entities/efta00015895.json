If we get it tonight, maybe, but Monday would probably also be ok. \nFrom: (USANYS)  \nSent: Wednesday, August 19, 2020 5:10 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: FW: Epstein/Maxwell \nHmm. Seems like may be we should reach out in the first instance given that it's the crim div chief? \nAlso, team never responded on the draft of the letter. Have you heard anything from them? I don't think there's any way \nwe get it filed by Friday at this point, but I suppose there is no magic to that date. \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, August 19, 2020 5:08 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \nThanks again for all of the valuable information you provided this morning. I  will keep you informed as \nwe finalize plans for the victim meeting. \nAs for your request, you should reach out to in the SDFL. Ms. is the Criminal \nChief and is prepared to assist you in locatin all criminal files still located in the District. She can be \nreached at or .  She is awaiting your reach out. Please let me \nknow if I can be of further assistance. \nFrom: \n(USANYS)  \nSent: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 12:03 PM \nTo: ME=1, \n(ODAG) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \n—Thanks again for your help on this a few weeks ago. We've since had a number of productive conversations with \nthe folks at OPR you pointed us to, and we think it would be helpful to also make contact with someone at SDFL purely for \nthe purpose of ascertaining what hard-copy materials they still have related to the case down there and how we could \nbest arrange to obtain and review copies. We have had very limited contact with an AUSA in the SDFL civil \ndivision who we understand was the primary point of contact on issues related to the CVRA litigation. Do you know, does \nhe remain the best point of contact for the issues we hope to discuss, or is there someone else in that office we should \nreach out to? \nEFTA00015895\n\nThanks so much, \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 2:33 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \nThursday at noon is perfect.

Among our questions was who, whether at ODAG, SDFL, or NDGA we should be in touch with at this point \nregarding documents. I also know OPR did a significant document collection last year. \nWe will reach back to OPR, but if there is a particular point of contact at SDFL or NDGA on issues related to document \ncollection, in particular, please let us know. And if a call on those issues would be helpful, happy to set one up. \nThanks very much, \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 10:56 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \n4fl \n.

We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential \ndocument/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were \nlargely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, \nanticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week \nfor a quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you. \nThanks very much, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nTel. \nEFTA00015897",
