Our agreement with Mr. Epstein contemplated a simultaneous plea and \nsentencing for October (or as we later agreed, November), followed by Mr. Epstein sell \nsurrendering to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008. From your last e-\nEFTA00013766\n\nmail, it appeared that the judge was under the impression that Mr. Epstein could not be \nsentenced before January 2008. We are hoping that Judge McSorley would consider \nconducting the simultaneous plea and sentencing some time before January 4, 2008, so that \nMr Epstein can comply with the terms of our agreement and begin serving his sentence on \nJanuary 4, 2008. \nI also would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the plea agreement, the Information \nthat you plan to file (f it hasn't been filed already), and any factual proffer or other documents \nrelated to the plea. Please also let me know the date and time of the plea and sentencing so \nthat someone firm our office can attend and insure Mr. Epsteinl• compliance with the terms of \nhis federal non prosecution agreement. \nIf you need any information regarding the federal investigation, or (fyou have any questions \nabout the terms of the federal non-prosecution agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me \nat the number below or in the West Palm Beach office. \nThank you, \nFirst Assistant United States Attorney \n99 N.E. 4\nth\n Street \nMiami, Florida 33132 \nPhone \nAssistant US. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax \nFrom: \nSent:\nTo: \nSubject: Epstein settlement agreement \nGood evening. I am the ASA with the Epstein case in Palm Beach County. The negotiated \nsettlement is a definite go. A difficulty arose last week at a conference with the judge on the \ncase. She wants the plea and sentence to occur concurrently; not a plea with a sentencing at a \nlater date. Therefore, the case was set for the first week of January, but the plea and sentence \nwill definitely occur before the January 4th date that was agreed on by all for the sentencing. \nIf you have any questions, please contact me at \nEFTA00013767",
