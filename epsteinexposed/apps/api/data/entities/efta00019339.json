We would like to \nhave a pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any \nway to push the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that? \nMike \nEFTA00019339\n\nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:31 PM \nTo: \nMiller, \n< \n< \nCc: \nSubject: RE: US v Epstein \nMike, Marty, Reid, \n; Martin G.

I imagine we \nwill continue to be in contact in the coming days; meanwhile, I appreciate you being in touch today, and I hope the \ninvestigations of these events will be thorough and swift. \nrespectfully, \nEFTA00019340",
