In \nparticular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including \nat least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor \ngirls by, among \nother things, helping \nEpstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately \nabuse victims \nknown to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age \nof 18. The \nvictims were as young as 14 years old when they were \ngroomed and abused by MAXWELL and \nEpstein, both of whom knew \nthat certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. \n2. \nAs a part and in furtherance of their scheme to \nabuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to \nEFTA00016373\n\nEpstein's residences in \ndifferent states, which MAXWELL knew and \nintended would result in their grooming for and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her \ncrimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly \nlied when questioned about her conduct, \nincluding in relation to some \nof the minor victims described \nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. \nFACTUAL \nBACKGROUND \n3. During the \ntime periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, had a personal and \nprofessional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his \nclosest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and \nin or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with \nEpstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. Over the course of \ntheir relationship, MAXWELL and \nEpstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, \nincluding in the \nbelow image: \nEFTA00016374\n\n4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nthe defendant, enticed and groomed \nmultiple minor girls to \nengage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a \nvariety of \nmeans and methods, including but not limited to the \nfollowing: \na. MAXWELL first \nattempted to befriend some of \nEpstein's minor victims prior \nto their abuse, including by \nasking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their \nfamilies. MAXWELL and Epstein would \nspend time building \nfriendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor \nvictims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would \ninvolve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a \nminor \nvictim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending \ntime \nalone with a minor victim. \nb. Having developed a \nrapport with a victim, \nMAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for \na minor victim \nby, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in \nfront of the victim, being present when a minor victim was \nundressed, and/or being present for sex \nacts involving the minor \nvictim and \nEpstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' \ninteractions with Epstein, including interactions where the \nminor victim was \nundressed or that involved sex acts with \nEpstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman \nwas present. For example, in \nsome instances, MAXWELL would \n3 \nEFTA00016375\n\nmassage \nEpstein in front of \na minor victim. In other instances, \nMAXWELL encouraged minor \nvictims to provide massages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized \nmassages during which a minor victim would \nbe \nfully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in \nEpstein sexually \nabusing the minor victims. \nd. In addition, Epstein offered to help some \nminor victims by paying \nfor travel and/or educational \nopportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept \nEpstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel \nindebted and believed that MAXWELL \nand Epstein were trying to \nhelp them. \ne. \nThrough this process, MAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed victims to engage in sexual \nactivity with Epstein. In \nsome instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the \nsexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in \nthe context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. \n5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a \nsexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to \nengage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's \nresulting abuse of minor victims included, among \nother things, \ntouching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, \nplacing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, \n4 \nEFTA00016376\n\ndirecting a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and \ndirecting a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. \nMAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S \nVICTIMS \n6. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or \nabout 1997, GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other \nthings, inducing and \nenticing, and aiding and abetting the \ninducement and enticement \nof, multiple minor victims. Victims \nwere groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the \nfollowing: \na. A a multi-story private residence on the \nUpper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein \n(the \n\"New York Residence\"), which is depicted in the following \nphotograph: \nEFTA00016377\n\nb. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by \nEpstein \n(the \"Palm Beach Residence\"), which is depicted in the \nfollowing photograph: \nc. \nA ranch in Santa Fe, \nNew Mexico owned by \nEpstein \n(the \"New Mexico Residence\"), which is depicted in the \nfollowing photograph: \n6 \nEFTA00016378\n\nd. \nMAXWELL's personal \nresidence in London, \nEngland. \n7. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims \nidentified herein as \nMinor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In \nparticular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, \nMAXWELL engaged in the following acts, \namong others, with \nrespect to minor \nvictims: \na. \nMAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor \nVictim-1 was approximately 14 years \nold. MAXWELL subsequently \ninteracted with Minor \nVictim-1 on multiple occasions at \nEpstein's residences, knowing \nthat Minor Victim-1 was under the \nage of 18 at the time. During these interactions, \nwhich took \nplace between approximately \n1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor \nVictim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through \nmultiple \nmeans. First, MAXWELL and Epstein \nattempted to befriend Minor \nVictim-1, taking her to the movies \nand on shopping trips. \nMAXWELL also asked Minor \nVictim-1 about school, her classes, her \nfamily, and other aspects of \nher life. MAXWELL then sought to \nnormalize \ninappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other \nthings, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being \npresent \nwhen Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the \nfirst year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein \nbegan sexually \nabusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was \npresent for \n7 \nEFTA00016379\n\nand involved in some \nof this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL \ninvolved Minor Victim-1 in group \nsexualized massages of Epstein. \nDuring those \ngroup sexualized \nmassages, \nMAXWELL \nand/or Minor \nVictim-1 would \nengage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and \nMAXWELL both encouraged Minor \nVictim-1 to travel to Epstein's \nresidences in both New York and \nFlorida. As a result, Minor \nVictim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and \nFlorida. Minor Victim-1 \nwas enticed to travel across state \nlines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein \nengaged in sexual activity with \nMinor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 \ntraveled to Epstein's \nproperties, \nincluding in the context of a sexualized massage. \nb. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on \nat \nleast one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in \nNew Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. \nMinor \nVictim-2 had flown into \nNew Mexico from out of state at \nEpstein's \ninvitation for the purpose of \nbeing groomed for and/or \nsubjected to acts of sexual abuse. \nMAXWELL knew that Minor \nVictim-2 was under the age \nof 18 at the time. While in New \nMexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 \nto a movie and \nMAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. \nMAXWELL also discussed \nMinor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-\n2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom \nMinor \nVictim-2 for abuse by Epstein \nby, among other things, providing \n8 \nEFTA00016380\n\nan unsolicited massage to \nMinor Victim-2, during which Minor \nVictim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor \nVictim-2 to \nmassage \nEpstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL groomed and \nbefriended Minor \nVictim-3 in London, England \nbetween approximately 1994 and 1995, \nincluding during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that \nMinor Victim-3 was under the age of \n18. Among other things, \nMAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor \nVictim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor \nVictim-3 to Epstein and \narranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and \nEpstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor \nVictim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage \nin sex acts with Minor \nVictim-3 during those massages. Minor \nVictim-3 \nprovided Epstein with the requested massages, and \nduring those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim\n-3. \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein \nengaged in sexual activity with \nMinor Victim-3 on multiple \noccasions, including at times when \nMinor Victim-3 was under the \nage of 18, including in the context \nof a \nsexualized massage. \nMAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT \n8. In or around 2016, in the context of a \ndeposition \nas part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, \nrepeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, \nregarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the \n9 \nEFTA00016381\n\nabuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of \nthe \nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed above. \nSTATUTORY ALLEGATIONS \n9. \nFrom at least in or about 1994, up to and \nincluding in or about \n1997, in the Southern District of New York \nand elsewhere, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey \nEpstein, and \nothers known and unknown, willfully and knowingly \ndid combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with \neach other to commit an offense against the United States, to \nwit, enticement, in \nviolation of Title 18, United States Code, \nSection 2422. \n10.
