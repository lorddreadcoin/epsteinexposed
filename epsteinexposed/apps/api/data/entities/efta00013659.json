I will pass this on to The DOJ Victim-Witness coordinator is going to call \nall the victims on Monday to offer the services of the pro bono lawyers and I will recommend that she add something about \ncalling the police in case of any further harassment. Thanks. \n Original\nFrom: \nSe • \nTo:\nCc: \nSu . . \nHi \nCan wive the parents a contact the local PD so they can call the police at a moments notice and file a police \nreport? I'm hoping the DC mtgs end soon so we can proceed. My fear is that drawing nto this will side track that \ngoal. \nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld \nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSent: Sat Mar 22 20:51:02 2008 \nSubject: Epstein \nHi all —  So sorry to bother you on a Saturday, but I am hoping that I can persuade you to reach out toMabout Epstein's \ninvestigators harassing the girls. received a frantic call today about Epstein's investigators bothering the parents of \none of the victims. According to the victim, he demanded to see the victim and when he saw her, he told the victim that \nthey had video of till\", were planning to put it on the intemet. We don't believe that Epstein actually has video of \nany of the girls, and as calmed the girl down, but this activity seems to be getting more aggressive. Remember \nalso that Epstein is using the state criminal case to subpoena depositions of victims in the federal case (who are not part of \nthe state indictment) to get information about our invention. These actions do not seem consistent with what Epstein's \nattorneys are supposed to be trying to work out with in DC. Any chance will ask Epstein's people to call off \ntheir dogs until he makes his decision? \nEFTA00013659",
