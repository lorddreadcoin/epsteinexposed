Maxwell \nCase Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN \nFiler: \nDocument Number: 104 \nDocket Text: \nORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed \nmotion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, \nthe Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially \nconfidential information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties \n48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by \nreference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. \n2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court \nwill file the Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the \nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial \ndetention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to \nsubmit a joint letter indicating whether they propose an redactions and the justification for any such \nproposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97. (Signed by Judge J. Nathan on 12/28/20)(jw) \nEFTA00031708\n\n1:20-cr-00330-AJN-1 Notice has \nbeen electronically mailed to: \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nLaura A.
