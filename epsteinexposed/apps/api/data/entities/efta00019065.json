Any indication of why they ended their relationship with him in 2013? \nAs I'm sure you've seen, NYT has a piece up on the relationship which suggests executives at JPMC overruled compliance \nefforts to kick him out back in 2008-09 but the article doesn't suggest any financial misconduct or even red flags in his \nJPMC accounts, just the fact of his prior conviction. \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/businessneffrey-epstein-jpmorgan.html? \naction=click&module.Top%20Stories&pgtype.Homepage \nEFTA00019065",
