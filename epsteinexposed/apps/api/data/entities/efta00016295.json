But when I last spoke with D.C., they said that they had only been able to \ntransfer approximately 16,000 pages — out of 29,000 total —  to \nan you remind what the latest is with D.C. in terms of figuring out what they actually transferred to ? I can't \ntell from looking at the hard drive we have uploaded. I want to get it onto Relativity, but not if it's just a subset and we're \nstill working on getting the whole file from them. \nI changed the file title slightly to reflect its contents — and some time when I can let the file transfer run overnight I'll put it \nas a subfolder in FBI materials, but for now it's here — \n\\\\ Usa.doj.gov\\ clouaNYS StAndrews \\Shared \\ USvEpstein-2018R01618 \\ Investigation 2019-03-06 case file from DC  hard \ndrive \nI also moved the folder of video discs we got into the 72 File folder, since those were all from that investigation (the black \nbook sting). \nWas thinking of this just because I want to make sure any docs we're getting are put on Relativity for review — I'll do the \nsame for the Boies docs, and it made me think of the D.C. stuff too since I think we may be a little stalled on that (unless \nwhat got was in fact the full 29,000 pages). \nFrom: \n[Contractor) \nSent: Thursday, March 07, 2019 12:00 \nTo: \nCc: (NY) (FBI); \nSubject: RE: Epstein \nThe materials on the hard drive dropped off have been placed here: \nUsa.doj.gov\\ clouaNYS StAndrews \\Shared \\ USvEpstein-2018R01618 \\ Investigation 2019.03.06 Hard Drive \nShe also dropped off a number of discs, which have been individually loaded here: \nUsa.doj.gov cloucANYS StAndrews \\Shared \\ USvEpstein-2018R01618 \\ Investigation 2019.03.06 Discs \nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \nBest, \nFrom: \nsc> \nSent: Wednesday, March 6, 2019 1:28 PM \nTo: ) [Contractor] \nCc: (NY) (FBI) c:.; \nSubject: \nEpstein \nHi \nThe FBI has a large amount of data for us on the Epstein case—can the case agent, (copied here) give you \nthe data for uploading to the shared?
