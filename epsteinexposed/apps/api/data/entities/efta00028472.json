(KPF) \nDear Judge Failla: \nWe represent Jane Doe in the above-captioned action. We write in response to Defendants' \ntwo letters filed yesterday regarding: (1) related case status (ECF 19); and (2) document \npreservation (ECF 20). \nSince we do not see any \nconceivable basis under Rule 13 of the Rules for the Division of \nBusiness Among District Judges in the Southern District to oppose designating these cases with \noverlapping defendants, legal issues, and factual allegations as related, we oppose Defendants' \nrequest for 30 days to respond. See Local Rule for the Division of Business Among District Judges \nin the Southern District 13(a); see also Poindexter v.  Cash Money Records, No. 13-cv-5882, 2014 \nWL 1383781, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2014); Pace v. Quintanilla, No. 13-cv-91, 2013 WL \n5405563, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2013). Our client was understandably shocked by the suicide \nof Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody, and is eager to obtain a  modicum of justice as soon as \npossible. All we have seen from Defendants, however, are efforts at delay. We very much want \nto push this case forward to trial as soon as possible, and it is essential to have a judge assigned \nwho will preside over the entire progress of the case in order to do so. I \nNotably, contrary to the suggestion in Defendants' \nletter, Plaintiff is not seeking consolidation at this time. \nWe further note that the cases that \nPlaintiff \nhas proposed as related have now all been reassigned to the same \nmagistrate judge, including: VE v. Nine East 71st Street et al., No. 19-cv-07625 (S.D.N.Y.) (Nathan, J.); Doe 1 el al. \nEFTA00028472\n\nCase 1:19-cv-08673-KPF Document 21 Filed 11/06/19 Page 2 of 2 \nKAPLAN \nHECKER & FINK \nLLP \n2 \nAs for preservation, the \nissues we have raised regarding preservation present yet another \ncompelling \nreason why these cases should be marked as \nrelated since the risks of spoliation face \nplaintiffs in all cases. While \nwe appreciate Defendants' explanation about Mr. \nEpstein's clothing \n(which was not \npreviously provided to us), that was not the point of our prior letters and emails to \nDefendants. (See, e.g., ECF 14 Ex. A.) \nThe point of our letters and emails was that we have asked \nDefendants to identify which categories of \ndocuments and other information we have specified for \npreservation they believe are \"argumentative, assume facts that have not been proven \nand implicate \ninformation \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege and attorney \nwork product doctrine,\" and are \ntherefore not \nbeing preserved. Defendants have failed to answer that simple question, which \nunderstandably causes us great \nconcern about spoliation given Mr. Epstein's multiple \nresidences \nacross \nthe globe, the fact that one of the two Defendant executors is a lawyer, and the fact that, as \na result of a will he signed just before his death, Mr. Epstein's estate is being \nprobated in the Virgin \nIslands. \nWe look \nforward to discussing these issues with Your Honor \nin Court tomorrow. \nRespectfully submitted, \ncc: Counsel of \nRecord \nRoberta A. Kaplan \nv. Jeffrey Epstein et al., No. 19-cv-07675 (S.D.N.Y) (Daniels, J.); Doe v. Darren K. Indyke et at, No. 19-ov-0777i \n(S.D.N.Y.) (Castel, .I.); Doe v. Darren K \nIndyke et \nat, No. \n19-cv-07772 (S.D.N.Y.) (Carter, J.); Doe v. Darren K. \nIndyke et at, No. I9-cv-07773 (S.D.N.Y.) (Ramos, J.); and \nDoe 17 v.
