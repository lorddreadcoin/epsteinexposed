Nathan \nUnited States District Judge \nUnited States \nCourthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell \nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nUSDC SONY \nDOCUMENT \nELECTRONICALLY \nFILED \nDOC 0: \nDATE FILED: 4/29/21 \nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell's bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms. \nMaxwell's appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while \ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial \nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: \"To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping \nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.\" See Exhibit A. We press our \nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell's sleep and the deleterious effect sleep \ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial. \nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a \nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms. \nMaxwell's conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest \nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell \nis classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health \ncare. (See Dkt. 159 at 3.) \nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell \"wears an eye mask when she sleeps\" (Dkt. 196 \nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she \nresorts to using a sock or towel to cover her eyes in an awkward attempt to shield them from \ndisrupting illumination every 15 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a \nvisible bruise over her left eye. The \"black eye\" is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera \nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as \nthey did in Saturday's bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who \nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point, \nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her \nin the SHU if she did not reveal how she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of \nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant to report \ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. However, there \nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the \nlights projected into her cell throughout the night. \nEFTA00024928\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 256 Filed 04/29/21 Page 2 of 4 \nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM \nThe MDC routinely places inmates in the SHU if they have engaged in physical \naltercation with other inmates or to protect inmates who are the subject of abuse. It would be \nironic if the MDC follows through with its threat to place Ms. Maxwell in the SHU: It would \nsignal that Ms. Maxwell needs protection from the very staff so intent on protecting her, since \nshe has no contact with anyone but staff. \nAs suggested by the Circuit, we ask the Court to address Ms. Maxwell's sleeping \nconditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or \njustify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance. \nVery truly yours, \nga C. \ncle.m444t. \nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM \nEncs. \ncc: \nAll counsel of record \nBy May 5, 2021, the Government is ORDERED to \nconfer with MDC legal counsel and provide the \nCourt responses \nto the following questions: \n1. Is Ms. Maxwell being subjected to flashlight \nsurveillance every 15 minutes at night? Or \nany other atypical flashlight surveillance? \n2. If so, what is the basis for doing so? \n3. And if so, can she be provided with \nappropriate eye \ncovering? \nThe Government is further ORDERED to share its \nresponse with defense counsel before filing it on \nECF so that defense counsel can indicate whether \nthey believe any private medical information needs \nto be redacted before public filing. \nSO \nORDERED. \nEFTA00024929",
