It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday \nmorning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. \nThat said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early \ntomorrow morning. \nFrom: \nSet: Wednesday. lulv 1.7070 9:07 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: GM \nEven 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested during \nbusiness hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow? \nOn Jul 1,2020, at 9:03 AM, rote: \nFYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. \nConsistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we don't \nhave her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be \npresented until tomorrow in any event. \nEFTA00029858",
