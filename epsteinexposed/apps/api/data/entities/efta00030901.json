They are from someone named \nin Australia. She knows to call by name. She is talking about \ncrimes committed against her. She claims to be a prisoner. She references Lisa Marie \nPresley, the British Royal Family, President Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein. We are passing \nthese along to you for review and follow up if appropriate or nothing if not.

Let me know if you have any questions. \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 7:44 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Voicemails \n> \nThe attached are 3 voicemails that received this morning at 9:22, 9:26, and 9:54 respectively. \nThey are from someone named in Australia.
