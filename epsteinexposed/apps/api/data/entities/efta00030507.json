Would you be available to meet at 2 or 3 \nP.M. instead of at 1P.M. so that there is time for lunch after the court status conference? Also, I have good news. When we \nmeet tomorrow, I will discuss a third victim whom I represent who would like to meet with you in August in New York. \nGloria \nAllred \nAllred, Maroko & Goldberg \n6300 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1500 \nLos Angeles, \nCA 90048 \n323-653-6530 \nwww.amglaw.com \nwww. gloriaallred. corn \na,ti.i* VA 9040 I \nGOON NO HI* \nBest Laiiii&S \nMAITAthinFlubbelr \nG\nPREEMINENT \nan \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 1:25 PM \nTo: Gloria Allred \nCc \n(USANYS) \nca'; \n(USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \nHi \nGloria, \nDo you have a sense yet of what time works for you and your client to come to our office tomorrow afternoon? \nThanks, \nFrom: Gloria Allred \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 6:17 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \nI understand.

The other victim attorneys have been attending the \nconferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early. \nThanks, \nFrom: Gloria Allred \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 6:00 PM \nTo (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \n< \nThank you very much for this information. I plan to attend this court this status conference on Wednesday. I am \nconcerned that the courtroom may be full and no seat will be available for me . Would you be kind enough to have \nsomeone on your staff save a seat for me? Also, since the courthouse is very close to your office I have emailed to \nask if she would be willing to meet at your office instead of at my hotel at 1P.M.Since her hotel is near to your office and \nnear the courthouse and since I will be in the area now as well , if she feels comfortable meeting at your office instead of \nmy hotel I am willing to meet at your office to save you and her the time to travel to my hotel. I will let you know when \nshe responds. \nGloria Allred \nAllred, Maroko & Goldberg \n6300 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1500 \nLos Angeles, CA 90048 \n323-653-6530 \nEFTA00030508\n\nwww.amglaw.corn \nwww.gloriaallred.com \nBest Lawyers \n®\nPREEMINENT' \nle= \nFrom: (LISANYS) \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 1:50 PM \nTo: Gloria Allred < \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \nHi Gloria, \nYes—in this district, criminal defendants are present at all court conferences absent unusual circumstances. \nFrom: Gloria Allred < \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 4:46 PM \nTo: (USANYS)\nSubject: Wednesday \nI see that a  status conference is scheduled for Mr. Epstein 's criminal case in court in New York at 11A.M.on Wednesday \n,July 31.
