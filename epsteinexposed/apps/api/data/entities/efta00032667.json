NATHAN, District Judge: \nOn March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal her reply briefs to the Government \nmemorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pre-trial motions. She filed the briefs, along \nwith the corresponding exhibits, temporarily under seal in order to permit the Government and \nthe Court to review certain proposed redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, \n8, 9, 11, and 12 did not contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 \ncontain limited proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits that the \nDefendant proposes be filed under seal. \nAs set forth in the Defendant's cover letter, the premise of the proposed redactions is that \nthe materials were produced in discovery and subject to the protective order that has been \nentered in this case. The mere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order \ncovering judicial documents is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi \nNissay Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight Specialty Mgrnt. Co., Inc., 12-cv-3274 (JPO), 2012 WL \n3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific requests or \njustifications to redact or seal any of the materials. \n1 \nEFTA00032667\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 205 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 2 \nThe Defendant is ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 on ECF \ntoday, as she did not propose any redactions to these and the Government has not voiced any \nopposition to these being filed without redactions. \nIf either side is seeking these or any other redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they \nmust file a letter indicating the redactions they request and providing specific justifications for \nthe sealing requests or redactions, in line with the principles set forth in Lugosch. By April 20, \n2021, the parties shall confer and submit a letter informing the Court whether any redactions are \nbeing sought. If no redactions are being sought, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket the \nremaining reply briefs on ECF by April 20, 2021. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: April 16, 2021 \nNew York, New York ALISON J.
