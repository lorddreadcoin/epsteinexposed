He has ordered us to make the Agreement available to the \nplaintiffs in this case pursuant to a protective order limiting the disclosure to the victims and their counsel only. \nHe further has ordered that we have to make the agreement available to any other identified victim and her \nattorney, so long as they also agree to be bound by the protective order. Judge Marra stated that the plaintiffs can \nlitigate the issue of further disclosure directly with Mr. Epstein in the context of their civil suits. \nWhen I  receive the Court's order and a signed protective order, I will provide them to you. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S.
