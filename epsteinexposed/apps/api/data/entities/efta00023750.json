The attorneys I mentioned are Marc Weinstein and Andrew Tomback, who \nrepresent the executors of Epstein's estate. I've provided them with your contact information, and as we discussed, they \nwill likely be in touch to discuss whether you have any objections to them providing the transcript to us. \nOn this subject, I wanted to let you know that our communications with the estate's attorneys about your client have \nbeen limited to our request for the transcript. We have not shared any details regarding your client or her cooperation \nwith our investigation. \nThank you, \nFrom: Jack Scarola \nSent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 11:55 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: 12/04/09 \nI am available right now. \nSent from my iPad \n>; \n. vs Epstein Deposition Transcript \nOn Sep 22, 2020, at 11:41 AM, \nHi Jack, \nDo you have a moment for a brief call about this today or tomorrow? \nThanks, \nCUSANYS) \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Sep 14, 2020, at 2:35 PM, Jack Scarola <> wrote: \nI am unaware of any protective order relating to the CMA case. \nwrote: \nOn Sep 14, 2020, at 12:10 PM, \n> \nwrote: \nEFTA00023750\n\nJack, \nAre you able to tell us whether there was a protective order entered in the civil suit, or any other type of agreement \nthat would govern disclosing materials from the civil case with us?

However, attached \nare fairly detailed notes of Paralegal/Investigator Mike Danchuk, who attended the deposition and recorded these \nnotes contemporaneously. appears to have held nothing back, and the notes certainly paint a picture of the \nkind of troubled young women who were particularly susceptible to Epstein's pattern of recruitment, grooming and \nvictimization. \nSent from my iPad \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Chris R.
