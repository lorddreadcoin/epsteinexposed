When you have a moment, could we please get on a call to discuss the below email from \nMaxwell's counsel? Understanding that we are still in the middle of the holidays, maybe we can find a time early next week for a call. \nThanks. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \nSent: Monde December 28 2020 8:42 PM \nTo: \nCc: Christian Everdell Mark S. Cohen \nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 \nGood evening \nWe hope you and your family had a joyful holiday. \nIn response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the laptop, in lieu of the MDC computer„ \nduring the typical length of time other inmates are permitted out of their cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to \n10:30 pm on \nweekends.) \nThe voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop. \nEFTA00015908\n\nThe MDC computer turns off every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery may be too taxing \nfor the operating system. \nWe also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's conditions and restrictions. \nThe constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current shift being unnecessarily restrictive, \npunitive, and threatening. \nMs. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell to accommodate capture on the handheld camera, \nrestricting her use of an already small confinement area. \nHer use of the laptop has been restricted. \nShe is invasively surveilled while showering. \nHer cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. \nOver the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was removed leaving her cold; and she now has \nthe onset of a cold. \nThe blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel. \nThe open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, with more frequently than other inmates are searched. \nHer cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her legal work and an invasion into her \nprivileged work product. \nShe has not received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail (return receipts indicating delivery to \nMDC on \n12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. \nWe will keep you apprised of our concerns. \nYour assistance is appreciated. \nBest-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. \nLawOffices of Bobbi ternheim \n••Covid-19 Notice: The West 19th Street office is currently closed but we continue to work remotely. \nPlease use email or fax, instead of regular mail, for all correspondence during this time. \nWe continue to work regular business hours throughout this situation. \nThank you for your consideration.
