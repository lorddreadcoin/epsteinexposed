One of our shared challenges in this time is nurturing the sense of community that's so important to what \nwe do—that spirit of shared purpose which brings us together in good times and bad to celebrate, laugh, and reflect. \nLast week brought some very public milestones: a  civil settlement that held Novartis accountable for years of illicit \nkickbacks and the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell. \nBut so much your important work is happening outside the spotlight, and I wanted to take a moment to celebrate that as \nwell. So thank you to everyone who has taken on new gun cases to help combat the recent rise in violence; thank you to \neveryone handling the civil and criminal litigation around incarceration in the Covid era with thoughtfulness and \ncare; [civil example]; thank you to all of our unsung AUSAs, paralegals, and staff. We miss seeing you every day, but we \ncelebrate your efforts today and always. This District is lucky to have you. \nUntil next time, stay safe and keep up the great work. \nEFTA00026999",
