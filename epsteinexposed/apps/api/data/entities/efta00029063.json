So the production is now due next \nFriday, July 2. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with that date. \nPlease also let me know if you need anything else from me in terms of the processes we discussed yesterday. We are \nworking with BOP to finalize the production, but please let me know if I should take steps beyond that (e.g., letting \nadditional people know about the production, etc.). \nAlso, does anyone want to see the production before it goes out? \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS) cz=> \nSent: Wednesday, June 23, 2021 6:08 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS); \nSubject: RE: Noel/Thomas FOIA Disclosure \n> \nThank you, \n(USANYS) \nI have no edits, subject to anything else have. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Wednesday, June 23, 2021 6:00 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) <>; \nSubject: RE: Noel/Thomas FOIA Disclosure \nHi all, \n(USANYS) \nThe Times consented to the one-week request.
