(I took \noff \nthis, so he doesn't respond with the substance and create needless 3500.) The most significant takeaway I recall \nfrom summary was that 'a said he gave Epstein the sheets he used. But again, this is second-hand, \nand has his own issues we can discuss separately. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 24, 2019, at 2:38 PM, (USANYS) \n< \nwrote: \nThanks. Did he provide more substance beyond he heard information relating to Epstein?
