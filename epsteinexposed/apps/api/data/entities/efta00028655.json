Would he be \nable to receive reimbursement for the $100 cancellation fee he received? \nEFTA00028655\n\nIf possible, would I need to fill out a SF-1164 to process his reimbursement, or is there another form I would need to fill \nout?

The reservations I made are: \nTuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI \n- JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) \nTuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach \n- Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 \nThursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) \n- Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. \nIf these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day \nbefore to at least make the reservations. \nLast question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because \nthere were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back \nEFTA00028656\n\nto New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? \nPlease let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 21:24 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nApproved \nSent from my iPad \nOn May 24, 2019, at 7:21 PM, wrote: \n-- I have previously-scheduled travel to San Francisco next Thursday for a wedding, and the way our victims have \nasked to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to \nend on Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just \nbook the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York?
