I would also suggest getting a hard drive from counsel \nso you can copy the data on the hard drive. I can have the vendor start the export on Monday. Can you please see if you \ncan get a 1 TB drive to send to PAE so they can copy the production on the drive. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 9, 2020 4:59 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nThanks everyone. I would like to produce all the native files—are they all bates stamped and ready to go? \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 9, 2020 4:57 PM \nTo: \n> \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nHey—, \nI leave it up to the AUSAs on your question regarding native files. The productions look good to me but I do have one \nquestion. The drive that we sent to be uploaded contained about 41,000 files. In these two productions I only see a total \nof about 22,000. Is that because there are some natives that couldn't be imaged and are thus not viewable on the \ndatabase? \nThanks, \n• \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, October 9, 2020 3:10 PM \nTo: \n; \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nHello, \nAll of the documents from this production has been bates stamped an is now available in Relativity for review.

I was wondering if you had a chance to look over the hard drive that Brian made on \nFriday. Do you have any ideas for how we should best proceed for producing? Is Relativity still our best bet? \nThanks so much! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 18, 2020 10:26 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \n1. Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential \n2. We are working on that. \n3. I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. \n4. That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp \nthem. \nThanks! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 18, 2020 10:10 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n; \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nI know you want to produce these documents can you please tell me the following: \n1. Will you placing a Confidential stamp on these documents? \n2. What bates number do you wish to use on the documents? \n3. How do you want to produce the documents (single page tiff images, database load files or PDF production). \n4. Also please note that once the documents have been loaded to Relativity there is no way to run any searches for \nthese images since they are mostly images and video. \nPlease let me know if there are any questions. \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 4:54 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \nHeys \nWe have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. \nThe files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size.
