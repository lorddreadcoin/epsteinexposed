However we will plan to come to your office as soon as the meeting this morning is concluded, \nincluding any individual questions that occur immediately after the general presentation, which occurred but \nwas relatively limited following the corresponding meeting in Florida last week. My hope is that we'll be able \nto get to your office by 11:30, and we can email to let you know that we're on our way if that's helpful. \nAlternatively, if you and would prefer to meet at the FBI, that should be fine, you just may have to wait \nfor a few minutes following the meeting. We can discuss either way this morning in person, but the upshot is \nthat we'll meet with you as soon as possible after the meeting. \nthanks, \nOn Oct 23, 2019, at 08:57, Gloria Allred < wrote: \nI  will not have a means to communicate with you after 9:30 this morning, because I will be at the F.B.I.

Please advise if you want to interview her there at 11:A.M or 11:30.at the end of their meeting or \ndo wish to use my office at 305 Broadway? I need to leave the interview with her by 12:30.
