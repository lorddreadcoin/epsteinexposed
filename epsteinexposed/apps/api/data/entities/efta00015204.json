And from what I could see, the \nteamwork was excellent. \nYou have my thanks and admiration. \nLet's be sure to schedule the team Webex when you all have time to do it. \nAudrey \nSent from my iPhone \n> On \nJul 6, 2020, at 5:07 PM, wrote: \n> \nAudrey, \n> This is now belated -- I confess that even I took a couple days off this past weekend! -- but I wanted to say \nthank you for the kind words, and to express appreciation for your support of this investigation, not only in the \ninitial Epstein prosecution but through the new angle on Maxwell and follow-up on other individuals as well. \nEveryone all the way up the chain has really cared about this the whole way through, and it was a team effort to \nwork through the byzantine legal issues, the challenges with various witnesses, and all the other ancillary things \nthat came up along the way. As one of the victim's counsel said to us recently, it has helped to right two wrongs -\n- the initial wrong of what Epstein and Maxwell did, and the secondary wrong of how it was approached by the \ngovernment the first time around. So, thank you again, and we're looking forward to the next stages. \n> \nOriginal \nMessage \n> From: Strauss, Audrey (USANYS) \naMINE> \n> Sent: Thursday, July 02, 2020 13:26 \n> \nTo: \n> Cc: \n> \nSubject: Your outstanding work \n> \nTeam, \n> While I got to stand up and talk about the indictment, it was your dogged and ingenious work that made it \npossible for this office to bring this very worthy indictment. \nEFTA00015204\n\n> We will still look for a time to have a Webex celebration of this milestone. \n> Enjoy the holiday \nweekend. \n> Audrey \n> \n> \nSent from my iPhone \nEFTA00015205",
