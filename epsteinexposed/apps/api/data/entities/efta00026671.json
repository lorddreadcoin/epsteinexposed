Or \neven an email address? We've been asked to try to tee up the Epstein unsealing for him tomorrow morning—I think we \ncould just call him at 9:00 when the court opens, but far more important people than I would like us to try to reach out \ntoday. We have all the Moses duty info since she's on this weekend, but nothing for Pitman (and he doesn't list any email \naddress in his individual rules). Thanks either wayl \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00026671",
