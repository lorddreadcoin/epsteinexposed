I'll get you the rest ASAP tomorrow, but we're tight on timing, so here's about \nhalf of it now. Two points about it: \n1. I wasn't sure whether you wanted to see every change, so I've put comment bubbles even where I think we should \njust accept the changes. \n2. In their new redline as of tonight, they are proposing to do each count in order. We won't have time to implement \nthat by tomorrow, but we should think about whether to keep it as is or agree to their proposal. \nThis is due today (Wednesday), and the defense has significantly blow their deadline to get this to us. If it would help, we \ncan seek an extension on that basis. \nLast, as you can see, they insist on putting our victims' names in filings. We are thinking of proposing to the defense that \nthey just note in a footnote their continued objection but stop using the names. Otherwise, we'd like to talk about going \nto the Court. Their practice is (1) burdensome to make us redact all their filings, and (2) an invitation for us to miss \nsomething and out a victim. \nThanks, \nFrom: Christian Everdell < \nSent: Wednesday, November 3, 2021 12:19 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n(USANYS) <a; Jeff Pagliuca \n•  Laura Menninger <a; \nSubject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Redactions to MILs \nAttached is the full redline of the RTCs. I made some changes to the sections I already sent you. Those are highlighted in \nyellow. I will send you the verdict sheet later tonight. \nRegarding the \"Minor-Victim\" terminology, I know the redactions are a  pain, but it is still our position that there is no \nneed to anonymize them and we object to calling them both \"minors\" and \"victims.\" So I can't agree to that. \nThanks, \nEFTA00030638\n\nChris \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, November 2, 2021 6:35 PM \nTo: Christian Everdell \nSubject: RE: Redactions to MILs \nHi Chris, \nJust checking in on when you think you might have the rest of the RTC over to us. \nAlso, do you have any objection if we edit the places where your redline uses victim names to the \"Minor Victim-X\" \nterminology? Our understanding is that we have to file this on ECF, and we just want to avoid having to redact anything. \nThanks, \nFrom: Christian Everdell < \nSent: Tuesday, November 2, 2021 3:43 PM \nTo: \nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Redactions to MILs \nDo you have a minute for a quick call about the jury instructions?

Please let \nus know which if any of your proposed redactions you would like to withdraw, and whether you would like to see our \nversion before we send it to the Court. In particular, please let us know by Thursday at 10 a.m. so we have some time \nbefore this is due to the Court. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 Saint Andrews Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00030639",
