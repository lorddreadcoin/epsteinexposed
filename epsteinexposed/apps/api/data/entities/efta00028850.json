ROBERT W. SWEET, \n12 \nDistrict Judge \n13 \nAPPEARANCES \n14 \nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP \n15 Attorneys for Plaintiff \nBY: SIGRID STONE McCAWLEY \n16 \n-and-\nFARMER, JAFFE, WEISSING, EDWARDS, FISTOS & LEHRMAN, P.L. \n17 BY: BRAD EDWARDS \n-and-\n18 PAUL G. CASSELL \n19 HADDON, MORGAN & FOREMAN \nAttorneys for Defendant \n20 BY: LAURA A. MENNINGER \nJEFF PAGLUICA \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028851\n\nApp.-0806 \n2 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 (Case called) \n2 THE COURT: Welcome back. I \nhave read the papers. \n3 Who knows. I might have missed something, but I think I've got \n4 it fairly well under control. I \nwould be pleased to hear \n5 anything anybody wants to tell me in addition to what you've \n6 already given me. \n7 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley. \nI \n8 would like to start, if it's convenient with the Court, with \n9 the pro hac vice motions that are pending because we would like \n10 counsel to be able to \nanticipate in these proceedings. Would \n11 that be all right if I \nstarted with that? \n12 THE COURT: I \ndon't care. \n13 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you. Your Honor, you have before \n14 you two pro hac vice motions. My client, \n15 would like to have counsel of record \nin the case be added as \n16 Professor Paul Cassell and Brad \nEdwards. We have presented \n17 those pro hacs to your Honor. This is the first time in my \n18 years of practice that \nI've had a contested one, so I've looked \n19 at the case law surrounding that and I think it is \nvery clear \n20 that a client is entitled to counsel \nof choice in a case. \n21 \nIn this matter she has selected these lawyers. They \n22 have been working with her. They had been working on this \n23 matter for many months now. We \nneed them as counsel of record \n24 in the case now because we are \ngoing to have depositions \n25 throughout the country where, for example, Professor \nCassell is \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028852\n\nApp.-0807 \n3 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 in Utah. He will be able to handle the Colorado depositions \n2 and things of that nature. We are here because those pro \nhac \n3 vice motions are being contested. The core piece of that is \n4 \nthe argument that they should not be allowed to seek \n5 \nconfidential information in this case. \n6 Your Honor will remember that I was \nbefore you a \n7 couple of weeks ago again trying to get the deposition of the \n8 \ndefendant, which is set for tomorrow, but still hasn't occurred \n9 yet. And in \norder to expedite that process I agreed to the \n10 protective order that was put in front of the Court and I \n11 waived all of \nmy objections to that in order to be able to \n12 \nfacilitate and move that deposition forward. That protective \n13 order provides that attorneys \nwho are actively working on the \n14 \ncase can receive \nconfidential material. \n15 My opposing counsel \nhas interpreted that to mean that \n16 that must be a counsel of record in the case. We disagree with \n17 \nthat interpretation. I wouldn't have agreed to a protective \n18 order knowing that they were already working \non the case. If \n19 \nthat were the situation, as your Honor can understand in this \n20 case, the majority of the \nmaterial has been marked \n21 \nconfidential, so it would \nprohibit my cocounsel from working on \n22 behalf of their client. \n23 \nYour Honor, I'm here to request on \nbehalf of my \n24 \nclient, that she be entitled to have her \n25 counsel of \nrecord of choice in this matter. If your Honor will \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028853\n\nApp.-0808 \n4 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 indulge me, I would like Mr. Cassell to address his pro hac \n2 \nmotion, please. \n3 MR. CASSELL: Good morning, \nyour Honor, Paul Cassell. \n4 I'm a law professor. \n5 THE COURT: I don't want to hear it. Sorry. No. \n6 Thanks very \nmuch. \n7 MR. CASSELL: Thank you, your \nHonor. \n8 THE COURT: Anything from \nthe defense. \n9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. Jeff \nPagliuca on \n10 behalf of Ms. Maxwell. \n11 \nYour Honor, I \nhave never opposed a pro hac motion in \n12 my 34 years of practice, so \nthis is a first for me. But it is \n13 clear, your Honor, that these lawyers will be \nwitnesses in this \n14 \ncase. \n15 THE COURT: This we don't know. I \ncan't make that \n16 determination now. Anything else? \n17 MR. PAGLIUCA: \nYes. \n18 THE COURT: You may \nbe totally right, but I don't \n19 know. \n20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, here is the problem. \nThis \n21 case is about the \nplaintiff's false allegations. \n22 THE COURT: Yes. I think I picked up on that. \n23 \nMR. PAGLIUCA: These are the lawyers \nthat wrote the \n24 false \nallegations. \n25 \nTHE COURT: I think I \npicked up on that, too. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028854\n\nApp.-0809 \n5 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 MR. PAGLIUCA: These are the lawyers that admitted \n2 that \nthese were false allegations. \n3 THE COURT: I know. I don't have to \ntell you, you \n4 know, there is going to be all kinds of \nprivilege issues, all \n5 kinds of issues about whether or not they have to testify. We \n6 are not at that stage. I \ncannot and I will not decide that \n7 \nnow. \n8 \nWhat else? \n9 MR. PAGLIUCA: There is a problem with the sharing of \n10 confidential information with these lawyers. These \nlawyers \n11 have both personal and professional \ninterests. \n12 THE COURT: I understand that. I get that point. \n13 Anything else? \n14 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your \nHonor. \n15 THE COURT: This is what we will \ndo on the pro hac. \n16 Everybody agrees, nobody, maybe in the world, but nobody in \n17 \nthis courtroom, \nincluding me, has dealt with this kind of \n18 problem before. That's perhaps only one \nof a number of issues \n19 that are unique about this case. That's \nneither here nor \n20 there. Clearly, the plaintiff has the right to \nconsult with \n21 any lawyer she chooses. \nHowever, the materials here are \n22 sensitive. I don't know the extent to which they have been \n23 designated confidential, but I'm quite sure that a \nsubstantial \n24 number of them have been, by the \nvery nature of the case, I \n25 guess. Let me put it this way. I want to be \nsure that we \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028855\n\nApp.-0810 \n6 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 enforce the confidentiality \nappropriately. \n2 Now, with those preliminary thoughts in mind I am \n3 going to deny the motion at this time \nbecause I know that there \n4 is a statement, some \nkind of a statement from the mediator in \n5 the Florida action. When I get a piece of paper that says the \n6 \nFlorida action is dismissed, a court order or whatever, then \n7 this motion \ncan be renewed. \n8 Also, I want an affidavit from the two \nlawyers that \n9 there is no matter in which they are personally involved, that \n10 they are making no claim, there is no \nclaims, there is no \n11 litigation in which they are involved. \nThe reason I say that \n12 is that I would not grant \nthe application for a pro hac status \n13 to a party in this or a related \nlitigation. If I get those \n14 affidavits and the \nstatement about the closure of the Florida \n15 \ncase in which they are a \nparty, then the application can be \n16 renewed and at that point I would be probably inclined, unless \n17 \nsomething else comes up or unless the defense tells me \n18 something that I don't now know, I would grant the application \n19 that brings us to the order itself and the meaning of the \n20 order. I think active in the litigation is the key phrase. \n21 The plaintiff has listed the \npeople that she considers would be \n22 appropriate and it's these two gentleman and I think one other \n23 person, and that's fine. \nThat is the definition. \n24 However, I'm also going to ask the \nparties to agree \n25 upon an order that would expand the \nconfidentiality agreement \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028856\n\nApp.-0811 \n7 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 to this \nextent, to require the plaintiff to indicate to me and \n2 to the defense if there is \nanyone else who is going to be \n3 active in the litigation. I'll tell you why I feel this way. \n4 I want to be sure that we can enforce the confidential aspect \n5 of that agreement, and I think that could be critical down the \n6 line. That's the \nreason for those requests. \n7 Now, we also have a \nmotion to compel. \n8 MS. McCAWLEY: Your \nHonor, can I just get \n9 clarification very \nquickly because I don't want to have to come \n10 back to the court so I \nwant to make sure I'm following \n11 correctly. Your ruling, because we have a deposition tomorrow \n12 that counsel was \ngoing to be assisting me with, particularly on \n13 the Fifth \nAmendment --\n14 THE COURT: Can't have access \nunless I get these \n15 materials by then. If I do, that's something else. If I do, \n16 fine. \nOtherwise, they can't have access to the confidential \n17 \ndata. They can assist. \n18 MS. McCAWLEY: Can I \njust point something out to the \n19 Court as well. \n20 THE COURT: The plaintiff can have any lawyer she \n21 wants. The question is the confidential materials. \n22 MS. McCAWLEY: Can I just \npoint the Court to one more \n23 issue, because this is their \nprotective order. They now said \n24 to the Court that these two individuals are witnesses or \n25 potential witnesses. The protective order allows in Section G \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028857\n\nApp.-0812 \n8 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 confidential material to go to deponents, witnesses or \n2 potential \nwitnesses. \n3 THE COURT: That's a different issue. I have not \n4 dealt with that. Obviously anybody who is a witness may have \n5 access to the confidential material, because they have to buy \n6 into the \nconfidentiality order in order to do that. But they \n7 are outside of it at the moment. \n8 MS. McCAWLEY: Your ruling \nis, they cannot attend the \n9 \ndeposition tomorrow? \n10 THE COURT: They \ncan. Anybody can attend the \n11 deposition that \nanybody wants to have, but they can't \n12 participate in it. They can't have access to the confidential \n13 material until \nwe get this matter straightened out. Ok. \n14 MS. McCAWLEY: I understand, your Honor. \n15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, we will be \ndesignating the \n16 testimony as confidential. \n17 THE COURT: You see. There you go. That's life. I \n18 can't believe that this entire testimony is going \nto be \n19 confidential. Honestly, you all \nare too much. Ok. If that's \n20 what you do, you know that's not going to \nwork because not all \n21 of this \nstuff at issue is going be to confidential. No, no \n22 way. What is your name? Ok. We will deal with tomorrow's \n23 problem tomorrow. \n24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Ok, your Honor. \n25 \nTHE COURT: The compel. Anybody want to add \nanything \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028858\n\nApp.-0813 \n9 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 on \nthat? \n2 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. Laura Menninger on \n3 behalf of Ms. Maxwell. I have taken the \nliberty, your Honor, \n4 of just making a very short \nlittle cheat sheet of the \n5 outstanding \nissues, if I may approach. \n6 THE COURT: Yes. It will be interesting to \nsee if \n7 yours is the same as the one we have prepared. Yours is much \n8 longer than \nours. \n9 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I'm \nhappy to address all \n10 of the ones on mine. I certainly am also happy to take \n11 direction from the Court regarding issues that you believe to \n12 still be of more \ninterest. \n13 THE COURT: As I say, I've read your \npapers. I would \n14 be pleased to hear anything you want to \nadd that you think is \n15 not covered or you want to respond or anything like that. \n16 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, one of \nthe largest and \n17 most significant pieces to us are the assertions by plaintiff \n18 that her own communications with law enforcement are somehow \n19 \nprotected by \n--\n20 THE COURT: I'm prepared \nto deal with that. \n21 MS. MENNINGER: The second one, \nyour Honor, and it \n22 \nrelates somewhat to the issues already presented on the pro hac \n23 motions, are our requests \nfor the fee agreements with all of \n24 plaintiff's various 15 or so \nlawyers who purport to be \n25 \nrepresenting her. Your Honor, I can find no case law that \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028859\n\nApp.-0814 \n10 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 suggests that the agreements \nare privileged, as plaintiff \n2 argues. She has refused to \nidentify when these individuals \n3 began their representations, the nature of the representations. \n4 THE COURT: There is a little confusion \nhere, at least \n5 in my mind, as to what we are talking about. I certainly \n6 understand the two \ngentlemen whose applications I have just \n7 dealt with and the third \nperson, who I take it is affiliated \n8 with the Boies firm. \n9 Obviously, over time the plaintiff has \nprobably \n10 conferred with other lawyers. But \nwho cares? Let's assume she \n11 has talked to 20 more lawyers. You want all those retainers? \n12 That doesn't make any sense. What is the universe we are \n13 talking about? \n14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I certainly understand all \n15 of the members of the Boies firm \nthat currently represent her. \n16 The third individual, if I understand \ncorrectly, is a gentleman \n17 by \nthe name of Stan Pottinger. He is a lawyer of some renown. \n18 He is also an author of best-selling books. He is listed quite \n19 frequently on plaintiff's privilege log as being part and \n20 parcel of advice being given to her on, quote/unquote, media \n21 \nissues. \n22 THE COURT: That \nis one. \n23 \nMS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there are other \npersons \n24 listed on their privilege log. Many are listed as \ncounsel for \n25 plaintiff, but others are listed. Attorney giving advice to \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028860\n\nApp.-0815 \n11 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 \nvictim's \n2 THE COURT: Is what you want the retainer agreements, \n3 if there are any, whatever \nthe arrangements are, with anybody \n4 on the privilege log that is \nlisted as rendering advice? \n5 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. That, I think, would \n6 be \nappropriate because some of our biggest issues concern the \n7 \nprivilege log. \n8 THE COURT: I \nunderstand. \n9 \nWhat else? \n10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we have \nasked for, but \n11 been \ndenied by plaintiff, her own deposition testimony in the \n12 Florida action. In that \ncase the Court entered a confidential \n13 \norder --\n14 THE COURT: I'm prepared to \ndeal with it. \n15 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, \nthe next topic are \n16 plaintiff's \nmedical records. \n17 THE COURT: I think I understand that. \nThere is one \n18 thing, though. Are there any pre-'99 medical records? \n19 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the \ncase law is quite \n20 clear that injuries that were preexisting --\n21 THE COURT: I'm sorry. \nExcuse me. Go ahead. \n22 MS. MENNINGER: Plaintiff has alleged \nthat the \n23 defamation of this \naction triggered or caused her to reflect \n24 back upon her alleged sexual \nabuse. She has also alleged, for \n25 example, that many, several, \nthree, I think, at last count, or \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028861\n\nApp.-0816 \n12 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 \nfour individuals had sexually abused her prior to ever meeting \n2 Mr. \nEpstein. \n3 If she has evidence that she already was suffering \n4 from depression or some type of mental health disorder before \n5 meeting our client, Ms. Maxwell, or Mr. Epstein, then her \n6 flashbacks, if you \nwill, could be related to other incidents \n7 that she has put out in the press. And she, I \nbelieve, has \n8 also told the press that she was \nin a drug rehabilitation \n9 facility at the time that she met Mr. Epstein. \n10 \nObviously, to the extent she was under the influence \n11 of drugs, which is \nwhat she has told the press, at the time she \n12 met him, she persisted in being addicted to drugs during the \n13 time that she knew Mr. Epstein, and it certainly relates to all \n14 of her requests for, I believe she has requested $30 million in \n15 damages, your \nHonor, not just from the defamation, but also \n16 harkening back to what she claims were her years as a sex abuse \n17 victim. \n18 THE COURT: What's the basis of your \nstatement that we \n19 will call it the \nflashback? \n20 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I \nbelieve \n21 THE COURT: Because, quite frankly, I was unaware of \n22 that. Is that my error? Are you telling me something that's \n23 not \nquite right? \n24 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I believe that is what \n25 plaintiff has alleged in her complaint. If you can give me a \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028862\n\nApp.-0817 \n13 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 moment. To the extent she is now alleging she suffers from \n2 emotional \ndistress from any preexisting --\n3 THE COURT: That's from the \ndefamation. \n4 MS. MENNINGER: She claims it's from the defamation. \n5 However, your Honor, if she has preexisting conditions that \n6 were truly the cause \nof whatever emotional injury she claims \n7 that she \nnow possesses --\n8 THE COURT: Correct me if I'm wrong, and \nperhaps \n9 plaintiff will make it clear, my understanding is that the \n10 injuries alleged result from the claim of the alleged \n11 defamation, period. \n12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, she \nhas claimed emotional \n13 distress from the defamation, yes. We are requesting evidence \n14 that \nwould show that she has preexisting emotional conditions. \n15 THE COURT: Not from the defamation. \n16 MS. MENNINGER: Not from the defamation. From the \n17 many, many other things that have occurred in her life \n18 predating even her meeting Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, as she \n19 has told the press, not because we told the press that. \n20 Your Honor, it is difficult, if not \nimpossible, to \n21 \naddress her claimed \n$30 million \nemotional \ndistress \nfrom a \n22 \ndefamation statement that was a denial of her allegations \n23 versus any emotional distress or emotional conditions she \n24 already had before any such \nstatement was made. \n25 \nSimilarly, your Honor, we have asked for discovery of \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028863\n\nApp.-0818 \n14 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 her claimed prior \nsexual abuse. She has, again, put in the \n2 press a \nnumber of statements regarding that, and I can't \n3 imagine that it is to the \nextent she claims privacy now, those \n4 might be relevant in \nour case both on credibility and also \n5 damage \nissues. \n6 Your Honor, we have asked for a lot of other \n7 interrogatories and documents that go to her damage claims, her \n8 education records, her work history. \nShe has refused to answer \n9 any questions before where \nshe has worked. She has refused to \n10 answer any questions about where she went to school. All of \n11 these are appropriate under the local rule \nfor interrogatories. \n12 Finally, your Honor, we have asked \nfor her contracts \n13 with media. She has refused to disclose those. She has \n14 refused to disclose her \ntax returns that show all of the \n15 payments that she has received \nfrom various media sources. \n16 THE COURT: I take it your view of any funds from the \n17 media would operate \nto reduce her damages. \n18 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, it also shows her motive \n19 and bias in bringing this case. To \nthe extent she has been \n20 paid for her stories to the media, which she has, she has \n21 admitted that she has been paid \nhundreds of thousands of \n22 dollars for giving these \nstories to the media. \n23 But to the extent that she \nis now bringing this \n24 defamation claim, if she is still either planning to receive \n25 more money from the media, she has a \nmotive and bias to make \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028864\n\nApp.-0819 \n15 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 her story consistent with her previous stories. She has \n2 claimed $5 million in lost wages, your Honor. This is a person \n3 who has worked primarily as a waitress in the last 15 years, \n4 until her media sensational story was purchased from her by \n5 some British \npress. \n6 THE COURT: Anything \nelse? \n7 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, \nthe other issues are \n8 addressed in our papers. We \nhave highlighted her incomplete \n9 production \non several fronts and her refusal to answer any \n10 interrogatories. So I would \nrest on my papers with respect to \n11 the other arguments. Thank you. \n12 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your \nHonor. I'd like to be \n13 very clear here, your \nHonor. Discovery production, I've tried \n14 to do that in our papers. But \nlistening to opposing counsel \n15 I'm concerned maybe she hasn't \nreviewed the documents we have \n16 produced. We have clearly produced all of the media \n17 communications she has, \nincluding records --\n18 THE COURT: All the \nmedia. \n19 MS. McCAWLEY: All of the media \ncommunications. She \n20 has issued wildly broad requests in this case \nwhich we have \n21 complied with. We ran over 200 search terms. \nHer request No. \n22 5 \nalone seeks communications with over 100 individuals. And we \n23 have complied, your Honor. This is \ncoming from the defendant \n24 who until Monday night, \nwhen you directed her to produce \n25 privileged information, has only produced \ntwo e-mails in this \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028865\n\nApp.-0820 \n16 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 case. \n2 Your Honor, we have complied with our production. We \n3 have produced the materials that she is saying we have not \n4 produced. It's incorrect. We have produced \nher school records \n5 that we have. We have produced her tax \nrecords that we have. \n6 We have produced all of those items that we have. \n7 With respect to \nher medical records I am going to \n8 direct you to the case that is cited in our brief as the Evanko \n9 case and it was a similar \ncircumstance to here. It was a Title \n10 VII case where there were emotional \ndistress damages being \n11 alleged and the Court found that the other side could not have \n12 carte \nblanche ruling over all of her medical records from the \n13 time she was born to the present. We met \nand conferred on two \n14 hours on their discovery requests, your \nHonor. We agreed to \n15 produce all of her medical records that we had from 1999 to \n16 2002 and anything else we had that was related to \nthe sexual \n17 abuse she endured at the hands of the defendant and \n18 Mr. Epstein. We have \nagreed to produce those. \n19 We have already started producing those \nrecords from \n20 the various doctors, from the treating physicians. Those are \n21 in their production. \nShould they be entitled to things that \n22 happened prior to \nthat? Absolutely not, your Honor. They are \n23 not entitled to a full-scale \nproduction of everything that's \n24 happened in this young \nlady's life. She was abused by these \n25 individuals. \nShe shouldn't be reabused by having to disclose \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028866\n\nApp.-0821 \n17 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 things that happened prior to her time with them. Your Honor, \n2 we do object to the production \nof that material. \n3 THE COURT: The flashback allegation. \n4 MS. McCAWLEY: I think what she may be referring to, I \n5 have not heard that term used, I think what she may be \n6 referring to was the fact that this \nis a defamation claim and \n7 the person who defamed my client was also an abuser, we allege. \n8 \nSo when she is defamed by the person who abused her and that \n9 abuser is \ncalling her a liar, that caused her significant \n10 emotional \ndistress. It's different than if some other \n11 individual that she had not had \ncontact with called her a liar. \n12 When she is talking about a flashback, maybe that's what she is \n13 referring to, but we don't have the word flashback anywhere in \n14 our \ncomplaint. \n15 THE COURT: No. I made that up. \n16 There will be no claim by the plaintiff that the \n17 defamation caused her \ndistress by making her aware or as a \n18 result of the prior sexual \nabuse. \n19 MS. McCAWLEY: The sexual abuse by \nthe defendants? \n20 \nTHE COURT: No. \n21 MS. McCAWLEY: Sexual abuse by others. \n22 THE COURT: \nYes. \n23 MS. McCAWLEY: No. Sexual abuse that relates to the \n24 Epstein \nperiod, yes. \n25 \nTHE COURT: \nThat I understand. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028867\n\nApp.-0822 \n18 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 MS. McCAWLEY: I think we are on the same page. \n2 THE COURT: I think talking about the earlier period. \n3 MS. McCAWLEY: Prior to Epstein, no, \nno, she doesn't \n4 have a claim with \nrespect to that. \n5 THE COURT: Anything else? \n6 MS. McCAWLEY: Your \nHonor, I just want to point out \n7 again that our production -- you \nasked us to complete that. We \n8 have gone through and run over 200 search terms. We have \n9 produced \nall of those communications she has had with all of \n10 those individuals. The things \nthat we have not produced are \n11 the criminal investigation records. I know your Honor is going \n12 to address that. I would \nlike to be very clear there. \n13 The point there \nis that she has said in the motion to \n14 stay papers that she \nfiled Tuesday that she needs to have that \n15 information so she \ncan decide whether she is going to be \n16 asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege. Truthful testimony \n17 shouldn't \nhave to be crafted, your Honor. She shouldn't need \n18 to know what agency is \ninvestigating her in order to decide \n19 whether or not she is going to be asserting her Fifth Amendment \n20 \nprivilege. \n21 We do have with us, your Honor, for an in camera \n22 submission, if you would like it. That is the way that courts \n23 have dealt with this issue \nin the past. When there is a claim \n24 from an agency that \nthe disclosure of that investigation could \n25 harm the investigation, we can submit that \nto you for in camera \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028868\n\nApp.-0823 \n19 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation. But it \n2 is my view that that needs \nto be protected. \n3 As you probably know, the history of these cases with \n4 Mr. Epstein, there were a variety of things that went on in \n5 \nthat investigation, so there is reason to keep an investigation \n6 in this situation protected so that they can properly \n7 investigate and move forward with that \nwithout being inhibited \n8 by other individuals. Your Honor, I would ask that that remain \n9 protected. \nIt's covered by her very, very broad requests, \n10 which is why we had to lodge \nthose objections. I would \n11 appreciate your Honor considering our \narguments with respect to \n12 \nthat issue. \n13 The other things, your Honor, that she has raised \nis, \n14 for example, she had \nasked for the Epstein settlement agreement \n15 and that was one \nof the things that she asked for. We agreed \n16 to produce that if we got the \nwaiver from Mr. Epstein because \n17 we can't produce it without \nthat waiver. \n18 I believe that covers it, your Honor. If you have any \n19 questions, I would be happy to answer them. \n20 THE COURT: Thanks very much. \n21 Thank you all for all the \nclarification that you've \n22 given me. I much \nappreciate it. \n23 With respect to the retainers and the dates of \n24 representation, that information will be provided for any \n25 attorney that's \nlisted on the privilege log. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028869\n\nApp.-0824 \n20 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 The plaintiff has told me that they have now supplied \n2 all the education and employment records that they have. \n3 think if there is any question about \nthat, if the defense is \n4 skeptical, I would ask the counsel for the plaintiffs to make \n5 that statement \non the record, not necessarily here, but by way \n6 of a \nstatement to the Court and principally to the defendant. \n7 On the question of \nresidences, that's, in my view, not \n8 \na contention interrogatory because of the nature of this case. \n9 I think \nit's more like listing witnesses. So I would say that \n10 the plaintiff should \nsupply all residences. \n11 The Dershowitz deposition \nwill be produced under the \n12 confidentiality provision. As I read what I've been given, \n13 it's to be held in \nconfidence and it will remain in confidence, \n14 but it \nwill be produced. \n15 \nYes, the tax returns should be produced. 15 years \n16 seems like -- I see. Ok. 15 years. \n17 \nThe medical \nrecords of the period '99 to 2002 will be \n18 produced and the plaintiff will indicate whether that \n19 production is complete or, if it isn't complete, when it will \n20 be \ncomplete. \n21 As for the pre-'99 medical records, \nbased on where we \n22 are at the moment, I do not believe that \nthose are relevant. \n23 Because the damage issue relates, in my view, solely to the \n24 defamation. If that changes in any way, I will revisit that \n25 \nissue. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028870\n\nApp.-0825 \n21 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 The criminal investigation. \nAny materials that the \n2 plaintiff has with respect to any criminal investigations will \n3 be turned over \nexcept for any statements made by the plaintiff \n4 to law enforcement authority and those statements, if there are \n5 such, will be \nsubmitted in camera, and I will review them. \n6 \nI hope \nthat clears up our problems. Tell me if I have \n7 failed in my effort to do so. \nYes, ma'am. \n8 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, two quick things, I think. \n9 With respect \nto medical records, we also certainly believe that \n10 the period from the time the statement was made in January 2015 \n11 until the present, because she has claimed emotional distress \n12 from that \ndefamation --\n13 THE \nCOURT: Sure, yes. \n14 MS. MENNINGER: The problem is, we have asked through \n15 interrogatory what were the names of the medical providers \n16 because they have not disclosed who \nher medical providers were. \n17 So there is no way for us to tell whether the records in fact \n18 have been sought from and \nproduced with respect to each of \n19 those medical providers. I will say that other records in \nthe \n20 possession of plaintiff lists other doctors who they have not \n21 asked for records from or releases. \n22 THE COURT: Let's \nsee if we can clear that up. \n23 \nMS. McCAWLEY: We have disclosed the names. \nShe has \n24 those names. We have also \ndisclosed records, the more recent \n25 records. We have \nnot contested that. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028871\n\nApp.-0826 \n22 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 \nWith respect to the interrogatories, your Honor ruled \n2 on \nthis previously, but there is a local Rule 33.3, which is \n3 why we didn't serve interrogatories in this case at this point. \n4 \nShe is deposing the plaintiff in two weeks, next week, whenever \n5 it is, and can certainly ask those questions as well. But we \n6 have disclosed the names \nof the providers. \n7 MS. MENNINGER: They have not, your Honor. \n8 THE COURT: Look. Wait just a moment. \nYou two are \n9 lawyers. Now, that is not an issue about which \nyou should \n10 differ. Go over in the corner right now, \nboth of you, and \n11 let's \nmake it clear who is telling me the right story. Now. \n12 \nI take it that I misunderstood \nthe colloquy and that \n13 this matter has been resolved. \n14 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, I think there was a \n15 \nmisunderstanding with respect --\n16 THE COURT: I \nwas sure. \n17 MS. McCAWLEY: Dr. Olsen has \nbeen noticed for \n18 deposition in Colorado already. In my view, we have \ndisclosed \n19 the doctors. Ms. \nMenninger says that there is other doctors \n20 that have been disclosed in documents that we have \nnot yet \n21 listed to her. I think in discovery we are finding \n22 \nadditional --\n23 \nTHE COURT: You think you may not have discovered that \n24 your \nclient has had some doctors \n25 \nMS. McCAWLEY: In the past. We are talking about \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028872\n\nApp.-0827 \n23 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 years and years ago. The recent \ndoctors we have disclosed they \n2 have noticed for deposition. \n3 THE COURT: What \nelse? \n4 MS. MENNINGER: \nYour Honor, with respect to the \n5 employment and \neducation records, as you heard plaintiff say, \n6 she has disclosed, quote/unquote, what \nshe has. Under local \n7 rule 33.3, we are allowed to ask for the names of \nwitnesses \n8 with knowledge \nat the outset of the case, and they might be \n9 custodians of \nrecords. We asked her who have been your \n10 employers. She won't tell us \nwho her employers have been. She \n11 has just gone \nthrough her computer and say if I have an \n12 employment record I'll give it to you, but I am not going to \n13 tell you who her employers \nwere. \n14 THE COURT: She will. \n15 MS. MENNINGER: Same thing \nwith the education records. \n16 \nWe asked her to list where she had gone to school and tell us \n17 where it is. She won't do it. Those are the things where my \n18 skepticism arises from. \n19 \nLargely, to the extent your Honor has ordered the \n20 \nproduction of whatever materials, criminal investigation \n21 materials that were not to be \nsubmitted in camera, those were \n22 the ones that involved plaintiff's statements, we \nwould like \n23 the other materials that they have brought with them today to \n24 give to \nyour Honor that do not encompass their client's \n25 statements to law \nenforcement. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028873\n\nApp.-0828 \n24 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 THE COURT: I don't know whether there are \nsuch. Is \n2 \nit possible that nothing in this lawsuit is clear? Well, I \n3 tried to make it clear what should be produced and what \n4 shouldn't. Anything that has been submitted to any law \n5 enforcement officer by the plaintiff I will take in camera. \n6 Anything other than that with respect to any law enforcement \n7 should be \nproduced. \n8 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your \nHonor. \n9 THE COURT: Thank you, all. I think we have the \n10 pleasure of your company -- do we need you next week? \nWe are \n11 up to date, aren't we? \n12 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, we have a motion with \n13 respect to our discovery that's set for next Thursday. \n14 THE COURT: That's fine. \n15 MS. McCAWLEY: \nJust before we adjourn, because \n16 Mr. Cassell had a question, and I \njust want to make sure that I \n17 understand, with respect to tomorrow's deposition, they are \n18 entitled to attend but have to leave the room if \nconfidential \n19 information is \ndisclosed? \n20 THE COURT: That's where we are at the moment, unless \n21 it \nchanges. \n22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, with regard to next \n23 \nThursday, both Ms. Menninger and I have other matters that are \n24 previously \nscheduled and it would be impossible for us to take \n25 care of those matters and \nbe here at the same time. I'm \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028874\n\nApp.-0829 \n25 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 wondering what the Court would \nlike to do about that. \n2 THE COURT: First of all, you know how we play this \n3 game. You don't ask me first. You ask your opponent first. \n4 \nHave you done that? \n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: I have not, your \nHonor. \n6 THE COURT: Will you? \n7 MR. PAGLIUCA: I certainly will, your Honor. \n8 THE COURT: Now. \n9 MR. PAGLIUCA: \nAbsolutely. \n10 THE COURT: You can go \nover to the corner, too. \n11 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we need a corner bar on this, \n12 your Honor. \n13 \nMs. McCawley, I'm wondering if we \ncan get a mutually \n14 convenient \ndate to hear that matter as opposed to next \n15 \nThursday. \n16 MS. McCAWLEY: Of \ncourse. \n17 MR. PAGLIUCA: That was simple enough, \nyour Honor. \n18 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, one more thing. I didn't \n19 realize that my \ncounsel can submit that stipulation to you \n20 because \nthat case has been settled --\n21 THE COURT: If I get \nsomething that closes that case \n22 and I get the affidavit that there are no other matters in \n23 which they have any claims or \ndefenses relating to any of these \n24 \nstatements, that will do it. \n25 \nMS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, so I know, if \nwe can submit \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028875\n\nApp.-0830 \n26 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 that by fax \nthis afternoon, will they be able to attend the \n2 \ndeposition tomorrow? \n3 THE COURT: I would think so, if I think those are \n4 adequate representations and so on. The \nstatement from a \n5 mediator doesn't mean anything to me. Something \nthat has a \n6 court sign to it. That I understand. But the mediator saying \n7 that it's settled doesn't \nwork for me. \n8 MR. CASSELL: Your Honor, \nmaybe Mr. Edwards could \n9 briefly explain Florida procedure. The case \nhas been \n10 dismissed, but it does not require a Court's signature. \n11 Mr. Edwards can \nelaborate more fully on that. \n12 MR. EDWARDS: Sure. If I may. There are two ways in \n13 which a case can be dismissed in Florida. One is by way of a \n14 court order. The other is by way of a stipulation. That is \n15 what was done. There was a stipulation of dismissal signed by \n16 both parties, that being the plaintiff and the defendants and \n17 counsel, that has been done \nand that was dismissed. \n18 THE COURT: That's \nfiled in the case. \n19 MR. EDWARDS: That's filed in the case and \nfiled in \n20 the \ncourt. \n21 THE COURT: Do you have a copy of that? \n22 MR. EDWARDS: I can get a copy of it \nimmediately. \n23 \nTHE COURT: Give it to the defense. If they have any \n24 problems, they will let me know. That sounds all right to me. \n25 What do I know about Florida except that \nit's flat and hot. \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028876\n\nApp.-0831 \n27 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 Your \nrepresentation sounds right. \n2 MR. EDWARDS: Additionally, \njust with respect to the \n3 affidavit, there needs to be an affirmation that we have no \n4 other \nclaims that relate to the statements in this case. Is \n5 that what \nwe are saying? \n6 THE COURT: I think it should be \nbroader than that. I \n7 think it should be -- look. I don't think it would be \n8 appropriate if there is any possibility for either of you to \n9 being a party. That's what I'm after. And having any \n10 proceedings against you arising out of the \nsituation with the \n11 plaintiff. I think it would be inappropriate \nfor you to be \n12 counsel if you have \nthe potentiality of being a party, either \n13 plaintiff or defendant, in any proceedings. If I get an \n14 affidavit saying that you're unaware of \nany claims against you \n15 or any intention to make a \nclaim arising out of the \n16 circumstances surrounding this lawsuit, that should be broad. \n17 I think that \nwould satisfy me. \n18 MR. \nEDWARDS: Ok. \n19 MR. CASSELL: I'll be filing those materials this \n20 afternoon, your Honor. My plan is to attend --\n21 THE COURT: The defense has a thought on this. \n22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I am looking at documents \n23 from Florida. \nOne is a docket sheet captioned: Epstein v. \n24 Brad Edwards and Paul \nG. Cassell, Lower Tribune Cases 15 000072 \n25 which shows that that matter is still pending. There is \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028877\n\nApp.-0832 \n28 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 another case, as I understand it, Edwards v. Epstein and \n2 Rothstein, which is also pending. \nI can confer about this, \n3 \nyour Honor. \n4 THE COURT: Let's \ndo this. When do you plan to return \n5 to the snow fields? \n6 MR. PAGLIUCA: There is still \nsnow on the ground, your \n7 Honor. Well, Friday night or Saturday morning is my current \n8 plan. \n9 THE COURT: That's \ngreat. Whatever the applicants \n10 have on this subject, please turn it over. You all can work \n11 out how you are going to do that. Turn it over to the defense. \n12 And if there is anything you want me to do, I would \nbe prepared \n13 to do it tomorrow. But that way I hope we can get it cleared \n14 \nup. \n15 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, we do have the \ndeposition \n16 of the defendant scheduled for tomorrow. \n17 THE COURT: Then everybody will be having a nice time \n18 together. Maybe you can all go out and have lunch, have a \n19 drink, and \nexchange these documents and go away happy. Not \n20 likely, but perhaps, depending on where you have lunch. \n21 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor. \n22 THE COURT: Anything else? \n23 MS. MENNINGER: Nothing. \n24 THE COURT: Thank you, all. \n25 \nOne thing. I would appreciate it \nif counsel would get \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \nEFTA00028878\n\nApp.-0833 \nG4LMGIUC \n1 together on my request for additional coverage in the \n2 \nconfidentiality agreement. \n3 MS. McCAWLEY: \nSure. \n4 THE COURT: \nThanks a lot. \n5 o0o \n6 \n7 \na \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. \n29 \nEFTA00028879",
