And copying in case she wants to look after the al stuff is finished tomorrow! I'll put these in \nalong with whatever comes from the chiefs — and thanks in particular for catching that I accidentally swapped the maxes : \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, June 28, 2020 18:55 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: draft press release \nIn case it's helpful, I put a few edits to this in the attached. Thanks so much for taking the lead on it. \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, June 27, 2020 7:32 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) < \nCc: \n) \nSubject: draft press release \n(USANYS) \n< \nI imagine this will go through many rounds of edits, but just to put something down on paper with plenty of time in \nadvance —  see attached. I'll be out of pocket tonight (unless there's anything time-sensitive), but can turn edits tomorrow \nno problem if that's useful. \nthanks, \nEFTA00017708",
