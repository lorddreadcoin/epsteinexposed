Discovery may be \nrelevant to the issue of the amount of damages suffered, but not the veracity of the claims. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, October 30, 2007 5:39 PM \nTo: Jay Lefkowitz \nSubject: RE: Epstein \nI called Judge Davis before I sent him the agreed upon letter. He indicated his willingness to serve as the \"decider\" I will \ncall him tomorrow to see whether anything has changed and when we can anticipate a decision. Regarding the subpoena \nquestion, let me think about that overnight. Thanks, \nFrom: \n)ay \nLeflcowilz [milk) \nSent: Tuesday, October 30, 2007 4:54 PM \nTo: \nCc: Acosta, Alex (USAFLS) \nSubject: Re: Epstein \nThanks \nI  haven't heard anything from Judge Davis. I assume he is still willing to take on the role you asked him to take on, but can you please \nlet me know if that is not the case? \nAlso, we are beginning to think about what discovery we may need to take to verify any claims. I am assuming that your office does \nnot want to be copied on any subpoenas or anything related to discovery. But please let me know if that is an incorrect assumption. \nThanks - Jay \nEFTA00013750\n\nFrom: \nSent: I \nTo: Jay Lefkowitz \nCc: \"Acosta, Alex (USAFLS)\" < \nSubject: Epstein \nJay, \nHere is an executed version of the addendum.
