    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThe Silvio J. Motto Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York. New York 10007 \nAugust 12, 2020 \nVIA EMAIL \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East 10th Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Mr. Pagliuca: \nThe Government writes in response to your letter dated August 9, 2020 requesting to use \ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case bearing \nBates Nos. SDNY GM _ 00000834 through SDNY_ GM_ 00000962 (the \"Unsealing Materials\") to _ \nlitigate a civil lawsuit. \nAs an initial matter, the Government notes that it remains unclear whether you make this \nrequest in your capacity as defense counsel to Ms. Maxwell in the above-referenced criminal case, \nor in your capacity as her attorney in a  separate civil matter. If the former, the Government \nmaintains that the \"Confidential\" designation of the Unsealing Materials is appropriate because \nChief Judge Colleen McMahon and Magistrate Judge Sarah Netbum have ordered that the \nUnsealing Materials remain under seal. The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the \nproduction of Chief Judge McMahon's April 9, 2019 Order (Bates Nos. SDNY_GM_00000904 \nthrough SDNY_GM_00000905) to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, and production of the entirety \nof the Unsealing Materials to Ms. Maxwell as discovery in the above-referenced criminal case. \nThe Unsealing Materials relate to an ongoing criminal investigation, and their public disclosure at \nthis stage risks interference with that investigation. Moreover, the Protective Order issued by \nJudge Alison J. Nathan in the above-referenced criminal case expressly provides that any and all \ndiscovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of designation, \n\"[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this \ncriminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this \naction.\" (Protective Order, ECF No. 36, dated July 30, 2020, ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a)). The \nGovernment notes that counsel for Ms. Maxwell expressly consented to that limitation when \nnegotiating the Protective Order in the criminal case. Accordingly, regardless of designation, the \nProtective Order expressly prohibits use of any discovery materials produced by the Government \nin the above-referenced criminal case in any civil case. \nEFTA00030904\n\nPage 2 \nTo the extent you make this request in your capacity as counsel to Ms. Maxwell in civil \nlitigation, you are welcome to avail yourself of requests for records through the Freedom of \nInformation Act or through a Toughy request, in the same manner as any other litigant seeking to \nuse records from a federal criminal investigation in a civil case. If you wish to make such a request, \nthe undersigned can refer you to the appropriate Assistant United States Attorney in our office's \nCivil Division, who will process your request. \nVery truly \nyours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nActing United States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: (212) 637-2324 \nEFTA00030905",
