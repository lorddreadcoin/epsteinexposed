In addition to the public access \nline, the Court has set up a different access line for victims who want to attend-- if you'd like me to, I can let the Court \nknow you plan to dial in, so that I can send you the victim access line. Just let me know your preference. \nThanks, \nFrom \nSent: Thurs ay, Apr' 2  , 1 :  5 PM \nTo: \nSubject: tomorrow \ncan you send me the link to watch tomorrow's hearing?
