INDYKE, RICHARD D. KAHN, \nAND GHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nDefendants. \n20-cv-484 (JGK) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAND ORDER \nJOHN G. \nKOELTL, District Judge: \nThe plaintiff \nbrought this action under a pseudonym as \"Jane \nDoe\" against \nDarren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their \ncapacities as appointed executors of the estate of Jeffrey E. \nEpstein \n(together, the \"Epstein \nEstate\"), \nand Ghislaine Maxwell, \nseeking declaratory relief and damages for sexual assault, sexual \nbattery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent \ninfliction of emotional distress, and \nfalse imprisonment. The \nplaintiff now moves for \ndismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons explained below, \nthe motion is granted, subject to certain conditions. \nI \nThe plaintiff filed the complaint \nin this action on January \n17, 2020. For \nthe purposes of this motion, the substance of the \nclaims is \nrelevant only insofar as to note that on June 29, 2020, \nMs. Maxwell was indicted on criminal \ncharges in this District. See \nECF No. 1, \n20-CR-330. On September 14, 2020, Magistrate Judge \nEFTA00029956\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 2 of 8 \nFreeman issued an order staying this case, pending the outcome of \nthe criminal \nprosecution of Ms. Maxwell. See ECF No. 8. \nAfter the \ncomplaint was filed, the Epstein Estate set up the \nEpstein \nVictim's Compensation Program (the \"Program\") and the \nadministrator started accepting claims on June 25, 2020. See ECF \nNo. 47. On November 29, 2020, \nthe plaintiff accepted an offer of \ncompensation from \nthe Program, which requires her to dismiss with \nprejudice her claims against the defendants in this action. See \nECF No. 94. To satisfy the requirement, the plaintiff sought \ndismissal with prejudice by stipulation pursuant to Rule \n41(a) (1)(A)(ii) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. See ECF \nNo. 87. The stipulation provided that \"each party shall bear its \nown attorney's fees and costs of suit\" but also that \"nothing \nherein shall be construed to preclude Ms. \nMaxwell from seeking \nfees or costs related to this matter from the [Epstein Estate].\" \nId. at 3. While counsel for the Epstein Estate signed the \nstipulation, counsel for Ms. Maxwell declined to sign the \nstipulation. The plaintiff then \nfiled this motion pursuant to Rule \n41(a) (2), seeking \ndismissal of the action with prejudice in \naccordance with the terms set forth in the partially-executed \nstipulation. \nII \nRule 41(a)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure \nprovides that, \"[e]xcept as \nprovided in Rule 41(a)(1) [which \ndescribes voluntary dismissals made either before the defendant \n2 \nEFTA00029957\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 3 of 8 \nfiles a responsive pleading or with consent of all parties], an \naction may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court \norder, on terms that the court considers proper.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. \n41(a) (2); see also Paysys Int'l, Inc. v. Atos IT \nServs. Ltd.,  901 \nF.3d 105, 108 (2d Cir. 2018).1 \"Rule 41(a)(2) dismissals are at the \ndistrict court's discretion and only will be reviewed for an abuse \nof that discretion.\" D'Alto v. Dahon Cal., Inc.,  100 F.3d 281, 283 \n(2d Cir. 1996). Once the district court articulates its terms for \ndismissal, \n\"plaintiff . . . has the choice between accepting the \nconditions and obtaining \ndismissal and, if [the plaintiff] feels \nthat the conditions are too burdensome, \nwithdrawing [the \nplaintiff's] dismissal \nmotion and proceeding with the case on the \nmerits.\" Paysys,  901 F.3d at 109. \nIII \nMs. Maxwell objects to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss \nwith \nprejudice insofar as the motion incorporates the terms set forth \nin \nthe stipulation and requests that any dismissal be subject to \ntwo conditions. First, Ms. Maxwell requests \nthat the provision in \nthe stipulation that \"each party shall bear its own attorney's \nfees and costs of suit\" be stricken and that additional language \nbe inserted to preserve her rights to seek her costs as the \nprevailing party in this \naction, and to sue plaintiff for damages \nin a subsequent action. Second, Ms. Maxwell requests that she be \nprovided with the unredacted copy of the release that the \n2  Unless otherwise noted, \nthis Memorandum Opinion and Order omits all \nalterations, citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks in quoted text. \n3 \nEFTA00029958\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 4 of 8 \nplaintiff has signed under \nthe Program. The release allegedly \nincludes the plaintiff's name and the compensation for the \nrelease. \nA \nMs. \nMaxwell's request regarding costs and fees has two \ncomponents: (1) the provision that \"each party shall bear its own \nattorney's fees and costs of suit\" should be stricken; and (2) the \ncondition should include the language \nthat \"[n]othing herein shall \nbe construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs \nrelated to this matter from \nplaintiff or from [the Epstein \nEstate.]\" See Proposed Order at 2, ECF No. \n93-2. \nThe provision \nof the stipulation that \"each party shall bear \nits own attorney's fees and costs of suit\" is indeed inconsistent \nwith the provision in the \nstipulation proposed by the plaintiff \nthat \"nothing herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell \nfrom seeking fees or costs related to this matter from the \n[Epstein Estate].\" Accordingly, the provision must be modified to \nstate that \"the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear \ntheir own attorney's fees and costs of suit.\" \nIn \naddition, Ms. Maxwell also requests that the condition \nspecify that she may seek fees and costs \nfrom the plaintiff in \naddition to the Epstein Estate. Ms. Maxwell argues that she is the \nprevailing party in this \nlitigation and, pursuant to Rule 54(d), \nshe should be allowed to seek costs from the \nplaintiff. Moreover, \nMs. Maxwell claims she should not be prejudiced from bringing a \n4 \nEFTA00029959\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 5 of 8 \nseparate action against the plaintiff \nfor damages—including \nattorney's fees incurred in this action—for the torts of abuse of \nprocess and malicious prosecution. Ms. Maxwell is correct that \nunder Second Circuit law, she is the \nprevailing party for the \npurposes of Rule 54(d). See Carter v. Inc. Vill. of Ocean \nBeach, \n759 F.3d 159, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that where a \nplaintiff voluntarily \ndismissed its case against one defendant \nwith prejudice, that defendant was a prevailing party under Rule \n54(d)). And under Rule 54(d), \"costs—other than attorney's fees—\nshould be allowed to the \nprevailing party.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n54(d)(1). Therefore, a condition that \nprecludes Ms. Maxwell from \nseeking costs from the plaintiff \nwould prejudice her from \nexercising the rights she \nwould normally have under Rule 54(d), \nand therefore, cannot be included. See Cross Westchester Dev. \nCorp. v. Chiulli,  887 F.2d \n431, 432 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"The purpose \nof \nauthorizing terms and conditions on a voluntary dismissal is to \nprotect the defendant from prejudice.\"). \nFurthermore, the stipulation in the amended form—that is, \n\"the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own \nattorney's fees and costs of suit\"—should not affect Ms. \nMaxwell's \nability to bring a future claim against the plaintiff for abuse of \nprocess or malicious prosecution. Accordingly, the condition \nrelated to costs and fees, in its entirely, is as \nfollows: \"The \nplaintiff \nand the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own \nattorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing \nherein shall be \n5 \nEFTA00029960\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 6 of 8 \nconstrued to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs \nrelated to this matter from the Epstein Estate and from the \nplaintiff.\" \n8 \nWith respect to the second request, Ms. Maxwell seeks to be \nprovided with an unredacted copy of the release that would \nindicate who \nthe plaintiff is and the amount of compensation that \nthe plaintiff has received. On \nthe one hand, the plaintiff has an \nunderstandable interest in \nmaintaining her anonymity, and the \nCourt entered an order to protect it. See ECF No. 32. On the other \nhand, it is important for Ms. Maxwell to \nknow the name of the \nplaintiff so that if Ms. Maxwell is \nsued by the plaintiff, she can \nuse the release as well as the dismissal with prejudice as a \ndefense in that lawsuit. Further, if the plaintiff were \nto appear \nas a witness against Ms. \nMaxwell in Ms. Maxwell's criminal trial, \nit would \nbe important for Ms. Maxwell to be able to use the \nrelease as possible impeachment material \nagainst the plaintiff. \nEach party's interest can be protected by requiring that the \nunredacted copy of the release be provided to Ms. Maxwell, but \nthat it not be disclosed for any purpose without the prior \napproval of this \nCourt. This will assure that the unredacted copy \nof the \nplaintiff's release is used only for a proper purpose. \nC \nBecause the conditions added to the stipulation affect the \nrights of each of the parties, each of the parties should be given \n6 \nEFTA00029961\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 7 of 8 \nan opportunity to decide whether that party is prepared to proceed \nwith the \ndismissal as provided in the partially-executed \nstipulation and with the changes provided by the Court. Each of \nthe parties must indicate that party's acceptance of the \nconditions specified by the Court by March \n19, 2021. If any party \ndoes not agree by that date, the motion to dismiss is denied and \nthe case will be stayed. If all parties agree by that date, the \ncase will be dismissed with prejudice subject to the stipulation \nwith the changes \nproposed by the Court. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the \nparties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments \nare either moot or without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the \nmotion to dismiss with prejudice is granted, subject to the \nfollowing \nconditions: \n(1) The plaintiff and the \nEpstein Estate shall each bear \ntheir own attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing \nherein shall be construed to preclude \nMs. Maxwell from \nseeking fees or costs related to this matter from the \nEpstein Estate and \nfrom the plaintiff; \n(2) The plaintiff shall \nprovide an unredacted and signed \ncopy of the General Release (the \"Release\") the \nplaintiff \nexecuted with the Program by March 23, 2021, \ntogether with a certification of its authenticity. The \nRelease is subject to the Order on \nPlaintiff's Anonymity \n7 \nEFTA00029962\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 8 of 8 \nin this \naction and shall not be disclosed except \npursuant to an Order of this Court. \nEach of the parties must indicate that party's acceptable of \nthe terms of the stipulation and the additional conditions \nspecified above by March 19, 2021. If any party fails to agree by \nthat date, the motion to dismiss is denied and the case will be \nstayed. If all parties agree by that date, this case will be \ndismissed with prejudice, subject to the stipulation with the \nchanges proposed by the Court. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: New York, New York \nMarch 8, 2021 \n/s/ John G.
