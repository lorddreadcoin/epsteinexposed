I make this affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant under Federal \nRule of Criminal Procedure 41 to authorize law enforcement to employ an electronic investigative \ntechnique, which is described in Attachment B, to determine the location of the cellular device \nassigned call numbe (the \"Target Cellular Device\"), which is described in \nAttachment A. \n2. I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and have \nbeen since 2017. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the \nsexual exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area \nthrough classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my \nresponsibilities, I  have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, \nenticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the \nexecution of search warrants involving electronic evidence and cellular devices. \n3. The facts in this affidavit come from my personal observations, my training and \nexperience, and information obtained from other agents and witnesses. This affidavit is intended \nEFTA00018664\n\nto show merely that there is sufficient probable cause for the requested warrant and does not set \nforth all of my knowledge about this matter. \n4. One purpose of applying for this warrant is to determine with precision the Target \nCellular Device's location. However, there is reason to believe the Target Cellular Device is \ncurrently located somewhere within this district. On or about June 30, 2020, United States \nMagistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker, signed a warrant for cellphone location information for the \nTarget Cellular Device (the \"GPS Warrant\"), which is attached as Exhibit A. Pursuant to the GPS \nWarrant, the FBI has received GPS location data since approximately 10:15 p.m. on June 30, 2020 \nand has also historical cell site data for the Target Cellular Device for the period June 1, 2020 to \nthe present. That data shows that the Target Cellular Device is currently located in the District of \nNew Hampshire and has been located in the District of New Hampshire for the last 30 days. The \nlocation data has allowed the FBI to identify approximately one square mile in which the Target \nCellular Device is located, but the location data is insufficiently specific to allow the FBI to \nidentify the particular building in which the Target Cellular Device is currently located. Pursuant \nto Rule 41(b)(2), law enforcement may locate the Target Cellular Device outside the district \nprovided the device is within the district when the warrant is issued. \n5. Based on the facts set forth herein, there is probable cause to believe that \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL has violated 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to entice minors to travel to \nengage in illegal sex acts); 18 U.S.C. § 2422 (enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal \nsex acts); \n18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual \nactivity); 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual \nactivity); and 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (perjury). Specifically, on June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in \nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment charging MAXWELL with these crimes, \n2 \nEFTA00018665\n\nwhich is attached as Exhibit B. That same day, United States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret \nSmith signed an arrest warrant for MAXWELL, which is attached as Exhibit C. \n6. There is also probable cause to believe that the Target Cellular Device's location \nwill assist law enforcement in arresting MAXWELL, who is a \"person to be arrested\" within the \nmeaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c)(4). In particular, and as detailed below, \nthere is probable cause to believe that MAXWELL is the primary user of the Target Cellular \nDevice which remains active. The FBI does not know MAXWELL's current location and \naccordingly requires the information sought in this application in order to locate and arrest \nMAXWELL. \n7. Because collecting the information authorized by this warrant may fall within the \nstatutory definitions of a \"pen register\" or a \"trap and trace device,\" see 18 U.S.C. § \n3127(3) & \n(4), this warrant is designed to comply with the Pen Register Statute as well as Rule 41. See 18 \nU.S.C. §§ 3121-3127. This warrant therefore includes all the information required to be included \nin a pen register order. See 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1). Consistent with the requirement for a pen \nregister order, I certify that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation by FBI. See 18 U.S.0 §§ \n3122(b), 3123(b). \n8. Consistent with the requirement for a pen register order, I   certify that the \ninformation likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation by FBI. See 18 \nU.S.0 §§ \n3122(b), 3123(b).\" \nPROBABLE \nCAUSE \n9. Based on the following, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that \nthe Target Cellular Device's location will assist law enforcement in locating and arresting \nMAXWELL pursuant to the arrest warrant described in paragraph 5, above. \n3 \nEFTA00018666\n\n10. As set forth in Exhibit A, United States Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker found \non June 30, 2020 that there is probable cause to believe that the location of the Target Cellular \nDevice will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. As set forth in paragraph 4 above, \nthat same day, the FBI received location information from AT&T revealing that the Target Cellular \nDevice is currently located in the District of New Hampshire and has been located in the District \nof New Hampshire for at least the last 30 days. \nII. Based on my review of Customs and Border Patrol records, I   know that \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL is a United States citizen and that she most recently entered the United \nStates in or about June of 2019. There is no record of MAXWELL leaving the United States since \nher arrival in June of 2019. \n12. Based on my review of court filings, I am aware that GHISLAINE MAXWELL is \nrepresented by counsel in multiple ongoing civil lawsuits in the United States. As recently as in \nor about June 2020, attorney Laura Menninger appeared in in the Southern District of New York \nfor oral argument before United States District Judge Loretta A. Preska on MAXWELL's behalf. \n13. Based on my review of AT&T records, I  have learned that the Target Cellular \nDevice is subscribed in the name of \"G Max,\" which appears to be a  shortened version of \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL's name. \n14. I  further know from my review of AT&T records the following: \na. The Target Cellular Device has been in contact with a phone subscribed to \nin the name of \"Laura Menninger,\" which I know from my review of court records is the name of \nan attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the \"Laura \nMenninger Phone\"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Laura \nMenninger Phone occurred within the last 30 days. \n4 \nEFTA00018667\n\nb. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed \nto the business \"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman,\" which I  know from my review of court records is \nthe name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the \n\"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone\"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular \nDevice and the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred within the last 30 days. \nc. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed \nto in the name of \"Isabel Maxwell,\" which I know from my review of a law enforcement database \nis the name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the \"Isabel Maxwell Phone\"). The most recent \ncontact between The Target Cellular Device and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about \nMay 2020. \nd. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed \nto in the name of \"Scott Borgerson,\" which I  know from my review of bank records and Amazon \nrecords is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank \naccount and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within \napproximately the last year (the \"Scott Borgerson Phone\"). The most recent contact between The \nTarget Cellular Device and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about March 2020. \n15. Accordingly, I  respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the \nlocation of the Target Cellular Device will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. \nMANNER OF EXECUTION \n16. In my training and experience, I have learned that cellular phones and other cellular \ndevices communicate wirelessly across a network of cellular infrastructure, including towers that \nroute and connect individual communications. When sending or receiving a communication, a \n5 \nEFTA00018668\n\ncellular device broadcasts certain signals to the cellular tower that is routing its communication. \nThese signals include a cellular device's unique identifiers. \n17. To facilitate execution of this warrant to determine the location of the Target \nCellular Device, law enforcement may use an investigative device or devices capable of \nbroadcasting signals that will be received by the Target Cellular Device or receiving signals from \nnearby cellular devices, including the Target Cellular Device. Such a  device may function in \nsome respects like a cellular tower, except that it will not be connected to the cellular network and \ncannot be used by a cell phone to communicate with others. The device may send a signal to the \nTarget Cellular Device and nearby cellular devices and thereby prompt them to send signals that \ninclude the unique identifier of the device. Law enforcement may monitor the signals broadcast \nby the Target Cellular Device for non-content signal information and use that information to \ndetermine the Target Cellular Device's location, even if it is located inside a house, apartment, or \nother building. The device will not intercept the contents of the Target Cellular Device's \ncommunications, such as telephone calls, text messages, and other electronic communications. \nFurther, the device will not collect any other data stored on the Target Cellular Device, including \ne-mails, text messages, contact lists, images, or Global Positioning System (GPS) data. \n18. The investigative device may interrupt cellular service of phones or other cellular \ndevices within its immediate vicinity. Any service disruption to non-target devices will be brief \nand temporary, and all operations will attempt to limit the interference with such devices. In order \nto connect with the Target Cellular Device, the device may briefly exchange signals with all phones \nor other cellular devices in its vicinity to determine whether those devices' unique identifiers match \nthe identifiers of the Target Cellular Device. These signals may include cell phone identifiers. \nThe device will not complete a connection with cellular devices determined not to be the Target \n6 \nEFTA00018669\n\nCellular Device, and law enforcement will limit collection of information from devices other than \nthe Target Cellular Device. To the extent that any information from a cellular device other than \nthe Target Cellular Device is collected by the law enforcement device, law enforcement will delete \nthat information, and law enforcement will make no investigative use of it absent further order of \nthe court, other than distinguishing the Target Cellular Device from all other cellular devices. \nAUTHORIZATION REQUEST \n19. Based on the foregoing, I  request that the Court issue the proposed search warrant, \npursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41. The proposed warrant also will function as a \npen register order under 18 U.S.C. § \n3123. \n20. I  further request, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b) and Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 41(0(3), that the Court authorize the officer executing the warrant to delay notice until \n30 days from the end of the period of authorized surveillance. This delay is justified because \nthere is reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the warrant may have \nan adverse result, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2705. Providing immediate notice to the subscriber \nor user of the Target Cellular Device would seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation, as such \na  disclosure would give that person an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of \nbehavior, and flee from prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b)(1). There is reasonable necessity \nfor the use of the technique described above, for the reasons set forth above. See 18 U.S.C. § \n3103a(b)(2). \n21. I  further request that the Court authorize execution of the warrant at any time of \nday or night, owing to the potential need to locate the Target Cellular Device outside of daytime \nhours. \n7 \nEFTA00018670\n\n22. I  further request that the Court order that all papers in support of this application, \nincluding the affidavit and search warrant, be sealed until further order of the Court. These \ndocuments discuss an ongoing criminal investigation that is neither public nor known to all of the \ntargets of the investigation. Accordingly, there is good cause to seal these documents because \ntheir premature disclosure may seriously jeopardize that investigation. \n23. A search warrant may not be legally necessary to compel the investigative \ntechnique described herein. Nevertheless, I  hereby submit this warrant application out of an \nabundance of caution. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nSpecial Agent \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nThe affiant appeared before me by telephonic conference on this date pursuant to Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 4.1 and affirmed under oath the content of this affidavit and application. \nDAzda,afrfratom__ \nHonorable Andrea K.

The charges set forth \nherein stem from the role \nof GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation \nand abuse \nof multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In \nparticular, from at least \nin or about 1994, up to and including \nat least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among \nother things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, \nand ultimately \nabuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under \nthe age \nof 18. The victims were as young as 14 years \nold when they were \ngroomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew \nthat certain victims \nwere in fact under the age of 18. \n2. \nAs a part and in furtherance of their scheme \nto \nabuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to \nEFTA00018677\n\nEpstein's residences in \ndifferent states, which MAXWELL knew \nand \nintended would result in their grooming \nfor and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal \nher crimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned \nabout her conduct, \nincluding in relation to \nsome of the minor victims described \nherein, \nwhen providing testimony under \noath in 2016. \nFACTUAL \nBACKGROUND \n3. During the time periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and \nprofessional \nrelationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his \nclosest \nassociates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and \nin or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with \nEpstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and \nEpstein were photographed together \non multiple occasions, \nincluding in the below image: \n2 \nEFTA00018678\n\n4. \nBeginning \nin \nat \nleast \n1994, \nGHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, \nthe \ndefendant, \nenticed \nand \ngroomed \nmultiple \nminor \ngirls \nto \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nJeffrey \nEpstein, \nthrough \na \nvariety \nof \nmeans \nand \nmethods, \nincluding \nbut \nnot \nlimited \nto \nthe \nfollowing: \na. \nMAXWELL \nfirst \nattempted \nto \nbefriend \nsome \nof \nEpstein's \nminor \nvictims \nprior \nto \ntheir \nabuse, \nincluding \nby \nasking \nthe \nvictims \nabout \ntheir \nlives, \ntheir \nschools, \nand \ntheir \nfamilies. \nMAXWELL \nand \nEpstein \nwould \nspend \ntime \nbuilding \nfriendships \nwith \nminor \nvictims \nby, \nfor \nexample, \ntaking \nminor \nvictims \nto \nthe \nmovies \nor \nshopping. \nSome \nof \nthese \noutings \nwould \ninvolve \nMAXWELL \nand \nEpstein \nspending \ntime \ntogether \nwith \na \nminor \nvictim, \nwhile \nsome \nwould \ninvolve \nMAXWELL \nor \nEpstein \nspending \ntime \nalone \nwith \na \nminor \nvictim. \nb. \nHaving \ndeveloped \na \nrapport \nwith \na \nvictim, \nMAXWELL \nwould \ntry \nto \nnormalize \nsexual \nabuse \nfor \na \nminor \nvictim \nby, \namong \nother \nthings, \ndiscussing \nsexual \ntopics, \nundressing \nin \nfront \nof \nthe \nvictim, \nbeing \npresent \nwhen \na \nminor \nvictim \nwas \nundressed, \nand/or \nbeing \npresent \nfor \nsex \nacts \ninvolving \nthe \nminor \nvictim \nand \nEpstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL'S \npresence \nduring \nminor \nvictims' \ninteractions \nwith \nEpstein, \nincluding \ninteractions \nwhere \nthe \nminor \nvictim \nwas \nundressed \nor \nthat \ninvolved \nsex \nacts \nwith \nEpstein, \nhelped \nput \nthe \nvictims \nat \nease \nbecause \nan \nadult \nwoman \nwas \npresent. \nFor \nexample, \nin \nsome \ninstances, \nMAXWELL \nwould \n3 \nEFTA00018679\n\nmassage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other \ninstances, \nMAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized massages during which a minor victim would \nbe fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in \nEpstein sexually abusing the minor victims. \nd. In addition, Epstein offered to \nhelp some \nminor victims by paying for travel and/or educational \nopportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept \nEpstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel \nindebted and believed that \nMAXWELL and Epstein were trying to \nhelp them. \ne. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed victims to \nengage in sexual activity with Epstein. In \nsome instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the \nsexual abuse of minor victims. Some such \nincidents occurred in \nthe context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. \n5.
