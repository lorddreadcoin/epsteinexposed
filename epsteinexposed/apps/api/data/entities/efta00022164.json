    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Epstein/JPM \nDate: Tue, 10 Dec 2019 14:31:53 +0000 \nWe're doing a brief follow up call this morning at 10 with the FCA, the British regulator who, as discussed, is looking at les \nStaley and his potential relationship with Epstein. No need at all to join if you're otherwise occupied — my guess is this will \nbe a brief update (from them) and a request from us that they not go overt anytime soon — but if of interest, feel free to \nswing by at 10. \nEFTA00022164",
