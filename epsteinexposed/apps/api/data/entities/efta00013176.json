Defense counsel is understandably \nconcerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate \ninformation through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is \ninformation like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his \ncounsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. \n(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely \nconcerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would \nwant to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, \nobviously.) \nPlease advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 15:56 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein update \nHIM, \nI'm checking in to see if you're able to provide us with additional information.

I too have been in touch \nwith since a little after 9 am, at which time I shared the limited information I had. The press release is the sum total of \nthe information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is \nmore information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further \nsince it is an open investigation. \nThank you, \nSupervisory Staff Attorney \nCLC New York \nMetro olitan Correctional Center \nNew York, New York   10007 \n>  8/10/2019 11:30 AM >>> \nIt is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we \ncan relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can \npass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? \nI understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the \nBOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. \nThank you. \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 10:43, \n> \nwrote: \nAs you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing \ninformation in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible \nthe very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was \nreported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can \nhave a  call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have \nless information than the press. Please advise. \nThank you, \nOn Aug 10, 2019, at 08:46 \n> \nwrote: \nPassed away.
