In the horse case, we did put photos in the indictment in order \nto use them in the press conference. \nOn \nJun 26, 2020, at 11:01 AM, (USANYS) > wrote: \nI suppose we could, but is it really necessary? Didn't we use a photo of Epstein at his press conference without having it \nin the indictment? The photo of them is, as you note, widely publicly available, so I don't think we could be accused of \npublicizing something not already out there (or any more sensational than the indictment itself). \nFrom: (USANYS)\nSent: Friday, June 26, 2020 10:50 AM \nTo: (USANYS) < (USANYS) < \nSubject: GM indictment \nWe are thinking that photos of GM/JE (the iconic one of them together) and the locations where the abuse happened \nwould be a good visual. To that end, can we put the photos into the indictment so there is no issue with using them at \nthe press conference? \nChief, Criminal Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office, \nSDNY \nEFTA00030776",
