Here is the revised paragraph 1. Thanks, \nI. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility for consulting with \nand, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the victims. \nIf the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States retains the \nright to request that the independent third-party consult with the United States after the preliminary selection but \nprior to the final designation of the attorney representative. \nFrom: Jay ft:0(mhz [mallto \nSent: Thursda October 11, 2007 3:12 PM \nTo: \n(USAFLS) \nSubject: Re: Addendum \nI need to run this by my client, but I would propose slightly modified language for para I. \nThe United States will assign to an independent third-party, who shall be appointed subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's \ncounsel, the responsibility for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney \nrepresentative for the victims. The United States retains the right to submit to the independent third-party a written statement, \ndisclosed to and approved by Epstein, that will set forth in general terms the role of any attorney representative in negotiating a \nEFTA00013499\n\nsettlement for any claimant and the further role of advising such potential claimants of their alternative right to retain their own counsel \nfor the purposes of separate litigation. \nI made it \"will assign\" because I understood that you didn't actually want to pick the lawyer and that you wanted judge davis, or \nsomeone like him, to select the lawyer. \nThe other edits should be clear to you in terms of what I am trying to safeguard, but I would be happy to discuss with you later this pm. \nThanks.

Thanks, \nIN RE: \nINVESTIGATION OF \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN \nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT \nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement (hereinafter \"paragraph 7\"), that agreement is modified as follows: \n1. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party, the responsibility for consulting \nwith and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the \nvictims. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States \nretains the right to request that the independent third-party also consult with the United States. \n2. Pursuant to paragraph 7, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney representative. This provision, \nhowever, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if \nafter consideration of potential settlements, the attorney representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant \nto 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation to pay the costs of \nthe attorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and \ncosts such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall cease. \nEFTA00013500\n\nBy signing this Addendum, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and \nexplained to him. Epstein hereby states that he understands the clarifications to the Non-\nProsecution \nAgreement and agrees to comply with them. \nR.
