But we'd be \nhappy to speak with you regarding the subpoenas to the ntities in connection with the Epstein \ninvestigation. We had been in touch with Steve D'Allessandro, who was very helpful, but he also mentioned that \nthey might bring in outside counsel. \nIf you let us know a couple times that would work for you tomorrow or Friday—and I'm copying my colleagues \n-and who are also working on the case—we'll get a quorum on our side and finalize a time. And \nplease let us know if any other information would be useful in the interim. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00020673",
