Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's \nrights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a \nsubmission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no \nrequirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. \nTo the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that we expect to vigorously oppose bail, as we \nindicated to the judge we would in the proceedings earlier this week. \nWould it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make \nmyself available whenever is convenient for you (and likely will be just me, as the remainder of the team will be traveling). \nthank you, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2019 20:57 \nTo: \n=Conlon' < >; \n'Roberta Kaplan' ; 'lenna Dabbs' \n;'Alexandra Elenowitz-Hess' < \n> \nCc: \nic>; \nSubject: RE: U.S. v.
