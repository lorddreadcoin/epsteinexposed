Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States \nCourthouse \n40 Foley \nSquare \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's directive at the \nNovember 23, 2021 final pretrial conference that the Government provide its anticipated order of \nwitnesses for the upcoming trial in the above-referenced matter.' Consistent with the Court's \ninstruction, below is the order of witnesses that the Government currently expects to call during \nthe first two to three days of trial: \n2. \n3. \n4. \ntestifying under the pseudonym \"Jane\") \n(testifying under the pseudonym \"O\") \nThe Government has also attempted to approximate the order in which its remaining \nwitnesses will testify at trial. The Government notes, however, that this order may change, \n' The Government respectfully requests that this letter be filed under seal. Because this letter does \nnot seek any relief or require any ruling by the Court, it is arguably not a judicial document subject \nto the common law presumption of access. Moreover, this letter contains the identities of \nwitnesses, including witnesses whom the Court has authorized to testify using pseudonyms or their \nfirst names. \nEFTA00014889\n\nPage 2 \ndepending on, among other factors, the pace of trial. Many of the below-listed witnesses will be \ntraveling from out of state, and many witnesses have personal and/or professional obligations \naround which the Government is attempting to schedule. Accordingly, it  is possible that the \nGovernment may call some of these witnesses in a  different order than that indicated below. \nAdditionally, the Government reserves the right to call additional witnesses should unexpected \ndevelopments arise during trial. \nWith those understandings, the Government currently expects to call its remaining \nwitnesses in the following order: \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nunder the pseudonym \"=\") \nther (testifying under the pseudonym \n'=\"2) \nying only under his first name, \"a) \nEying only under her first name, \"a) \ntifying only under her first name, \"a\") \nEying under her full name, ' \n2  The Government previously indicated that this witness would testify under the pseudonym \n\"John.\" Because defense counsel expressed concerns about confusion that could arise from that \nname, the Government has changed this pseudonym to \"= \nEFTA00014890\n\nPage \n3 \n31 \nFinally, the \nGovernment notes that it \nmay elect not to call \nsome of the \nabove-listed \nwitnesses as \ntrial progresses. The \nGovernment will \npromptly inform the \nCourt and defense \ncounsel \nif it \ndetermines that any witness \nwill not be called \nin the Government's \ncase-in-chief. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  \ns/\nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nSouthern District of \nNew York \nCc: \nDefense \nCounsel (by email) \nEFTA00014891",
