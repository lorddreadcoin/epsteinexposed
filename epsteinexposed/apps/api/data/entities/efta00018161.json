As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1— 3 and is \nabout to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is \ncurrently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and \nthe export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches: \nQ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 01 \nQ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 02 \nQ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 03 \nIf there are any questions please let me know. \nThank you. \nEFTA00018161",
