I did not know that the defense planned to file their letter in advance, and they did \nnot ask us for input before filing. Judge Nathan endorsed the order within less than 24 hours without allowing \ntime for any response. To be very clear, my office has never filed any response to the defense motion. The \ndefense represented in their letter what I  have said repeatedly to them and you, which is that my office has no \nobjection to Maxwell accessing the laptop on weekends. \nI am sony that Judge Nathan ruled before you had the opportunity to inform us that you wished to respond to the \ndefense letter. Given that you did not tell me that you wanted to respond when I sent you the defense letter, I did \nnot realize that you intended to object. (I have attached the only response I received from you after I sent you \nthe defense letter, which makes no indication of any intent to file an objection.) Had I realized, I would have \nnotified the \nCourt. \nWe will, of course, file whatever letter you wish to submit with Judge Nathan, and we are always happy to \ndiscuss if that would be useful. We remain very grateful for all of your assistance. \nBest \nOn \nJan 15, 2021, at 10:35 PM, ote: \nWe were informed after our afternoon meeting of the order. While we will be complying with the order this \nweekend, we will be filing a letter requesting the order be vacated. Judge Nathan's order states \"the \nunobserved to order.\" I explicitly stated that MDC was objection and denying this however you failed to \nrepresent that to the court it seems. While I  understand you do not work at the institution, and you may not \nunderstand the hardships this may cause, ii do expect that you would understand it is setting precedent that \ncauses many serious concerns and hardships for the institution, myself, and all the other staff. \nEFTA00021724\n\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smarlphone \nI just received the below from Maxwell's attorney. Would you please confirm that the MDC intends to comply with \nJudge Nathan's order? \nThanks, \nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \nSent: Friday, January 15, 2021 5:58 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Fwd: URGENT-Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 - COURT ORDER \nGood \nevening, \nIn disregard of the Court's order, the team leader of Ms. Maxwell's security detail \ninformed Ms. Maxwell that she will not have access to the laptop on Saturday. \n(See email below.) \nI will be notifying Judge Nathan of MDC's blatant \ndisregard \nof the Court's order. \nPerhaps this will move the Court to direct Warden to appear and face questions \nconcerning the mistreatment of Ms. Maxwell and misconduct by his staff. \nAny assistance you can provide to effect compliance with the order so that Ms. Maxwell \nhas access to the laptop over this long holiday weekend is greatly appreciated. \nThank you. Enjoy the long weekend. \nBobbi \nEFTA00021725\n\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. \nLaw Offices of Bobbi C.
