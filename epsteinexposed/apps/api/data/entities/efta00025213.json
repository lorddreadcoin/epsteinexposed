We spoke with the civil AUSA on the Radar Online case today, so \nwe have updates on that as well. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, March 11, 2021 9:15 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell/FOIA \nThanks, On the plus side, it would appear that all of these are recent and pertain (in general terms) to the \nEpstein investigation we all did and that you are intimately familiar with. Do we have a way of compiling a list of the \nrequests made to Civ Div and handled by them? They must have a FOIA coordinator or something like that... \nEFTA00025213\n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, March 10, 2021 5:56 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: FW: Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell/FOIA \n>; \nFYI...is list has about sixteen cases. I've askeclMto check his records to see if there are more. When we have the \nfull list, and I will check in with you to see where we should go from here. Two things to note for now: \n•  One of these FOIA requests is from Boies Schiller, and the log notes that BSF has made multiple requests, \nincluding to other districts. \n•  This list only includes FOIA requests directed to our office. It does not include FOIA lawsuits our civil division has \nhandled, based on FOIA requests to other governmental components (for example, the Radar Online case \nreferenced in Maxwell's letter). \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, March 10, 2021 5:23 PM \nC \nTo:\nc: \nSubject: RE: Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell/FOIA \nAs we just discussed: \nHere is what we have in our FOIA tracking database regarding Epstein FOlAs. \nAnd also attached is the letter in PPI about discovery vs FOIA (seep. 8) \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesda March 10, 2021 5:20 PM \nTo \nCc \nSubject: Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell/FOIA \nHi Darian, \n> \nHope you're doing well. andlMland I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever \nreceived (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. suggested that you'd be the \nbest point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information: \n•  A list of all FOIA requests our office has received; \n•  For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and \n•  Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is. \nThat would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search. \nThanks very much, \nEFTA00025214\n\nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY \n10007 \nEFTA00025215",
