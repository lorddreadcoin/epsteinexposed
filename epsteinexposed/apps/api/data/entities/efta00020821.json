The outside vendor is PAE, which maintains our office's Relativity database. The production \nat issue consists of documents extracted from numerous electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in \nNew York and the Virgin Islands, which were loaded onto Relativity for privilege and responsiveness review. On October \n7, 2020, our office's filter team completed its privilege review of those documents. On October 21, 2020, the case team \ncompleted the responsiveness review and identified approximately 1.2 million documents as responsive. That same \nnight, the case team asked PAE to prepare those approximately 1.2 million documents for production by imaging, bates \nstamping, and downloading the documents. We have repeatedly told PAE of the November 9th discovery deadline. \nYesterday, PAE informed us that it had finished imaging the production but would not be technologically able to finish \nbates stamping and downloading the production by November 9th.  PAE has indicated that it expects to complete the \nproduction by November 19th, though it is making every effort to move as quickly as possible. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Jeff Pagliuca \nSent: Thursday, November 5, 2020 1:42 PM \nTo: ) ,,t); Christian Everdell ; Mark S. \nCohen <>; Laura Menninger < \n>; \nBobbi Sternheim \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: US v.

Maxwell - Request for Extension of Discovery Deadline \nCounsel, \nToday our outside vendor informed us that it will not be technologically possible for the vendor to finish processing the \nGovernment's final discovery production in this case by the November 9, 2020 deadline. The vendor has indicated that it \nexpects to finish processing the production by November 19, 2020, at which point it will send the production to 1 St. \nAndrew's Plaza for us to conduct a spot check before providing it to you. Accordingly, we intend to ask the Court to \nextend the final discovery deadline, solely for the production of materials being processed by the vendor, by two weeks to \nNovember 23, 2020. We still expect to make a separate discovery production to you on November 9, 2020, and the only \nmaterial that will be the subject of this extension request is that being processed by the vendor. \nWould you please let us know your position on this extension request? We are also happy to have a phone call to discuss. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00020824",
