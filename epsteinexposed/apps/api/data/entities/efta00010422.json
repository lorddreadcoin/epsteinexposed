Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RNIB) \nDear \nJudge Berman: \nAs the Court is aware, on the morning of August \n10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in \ncustody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August 16, 2019, and after conducting an \nautopsy, the Office of \nthe Chief Medical Examiner of the City of \nNew York issued a statement \nidentifying the cause of death as hanging, and the manner of death as suicide. In light of the death \nof the defendant prior to \na conviction becoming final, the \nGovernment must request the Court \napprove the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi. \nConsistent with our practice \nthroughout this case and our obligations under the \nCrime \nVictims' Rights \nAct, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since \nlearning of the death of the \ndefendant and will similarly notify all known victims \nof the attached \norder, once entered. As \nthis Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing \nits utmost to stand up for the victims who \nhave already come forward, as well as for the many \nothers who have yet to do so. \nCc: All counsel of record (Via ECF) \nBy: \nAlison Moe / Allx Rossmiller / Maurene Comey \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: (212) 637-2225 / 2415 / 2324 \nRespectfully submitted, \nGEOFFREY S.

The filing of this nolle prosequi will dispose of \nthis case with respect to JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the defendant. \n2. On July 2, 2019, \nIndictment 19 Cr. 490 (the \n\"Indictment\") was returned, charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking \nof minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one \ncount of sex \ntrafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. \n3. On or about August 10, 2019, \nwhile the above-\ncaptioned case was pending, but prior to any trial or other \ndisposition, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died. \n4. Because JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died while \nthis case was \npending, and therefore before a final judgment was \nissued, the Indictment must be dismissed \nunder the rule of \nabatement. See United States v. Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. \n1998). \nEFTA00010423\n\nCase 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 47-1 Filed 08/19/19 Page 2 of 2 \nS.
