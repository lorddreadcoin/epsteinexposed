Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), \nand its progeny. The Government wishes to bring your attention to the following statements, \nwhich could constitute Brady material: \n• Inmate-4 stated that on the night of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers \nperformed \"a few rounds that night\" but Inmate-4 could not recall what time. \n• Inmate-5 stated that Noel came by \"around 10 to do the count\" on the evening of \nAugust 9, 2019. \n• Inmate-7 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers \"did \n[a] count around 1 0ish but not after that.\" Inmate-7 further stated that Inmate-7 \nwas not really awake for the 3:00 a.m. count on August 10, 2019, \"but hear[d] [the] \ngate open.\" \nThis range excludes SDNY_00007661-SDNY_00007665, which the court has directed the \nGovernment to wtihhold. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00025242\n\nPage 5 \n• Inmate-11 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019 into the morning of August \n10, 2019, the \"last check was made sometime between 12:30Am —  1:00AM. The \nmale black stayed by the door and the female black walked through the tier but did \nnot walk all the way in.\" \nIn addition, materials from Inmate-2 include a statement which could constitute Brady, however, \nthe Court has directed the Government to withhold these materials from production due to pending \nex parse litigation. The Government will produce these materials if and when the Court orders \ntheir production. Beyond the above materials, to date, the Government is unaware of any other \nBrady material regarding your client, but will provide timely disclosure if any such material comes \nto light. The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 \n(1972), and its progeny, to the extent it has not already been produced, in a timely manner prior to \ntrial. \nII. Materials Not Disclosed \nIn addition to the materials identified above, the Government is in possession of additional \nrecords that are not discovery materials under Rule 16(a). Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, \nthe Government is providing the following inventory of those materials that have not been \nproduced: \n• Financial records produced by Bank of America for accounts in the names of \n• Financial records produced by Citibank for accounts in the names of-\nand\n• Credit report records produced by Equifax in the names of \n• Financial records roduced b JPMor an Chase Bank for accounts in the names of \n• Financial records produced b Municip al Credit Union for accounts in the names of \n• Financial records produced by Navy Federal Credit Union for accounts in the names of \n• Financial records produced by TD Bank for accounts in the names of \n• Financial records produced by Wells Fargo Bank for an account in the name of \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00025243\n\nPage 6 \nIf at any time you believe that any of the foregoing materials should be produced as Rule \n16(a) materials, please promptly notify the Government. \nIII. Disclosure by the Defendant \nIn light of your request for the foregoing discovery, the Government hereby requests \nreciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow \ninspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the \ndefendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as \nevidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental \nexaminations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies \nthereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to \nintroduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the \ndefendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he \nwill call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We \nrequest that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the \ndefendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. \nWe also wish to remind you that Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.3(a) requires you to provide the \nGovernment with written notice if the defendant intends to claim a defense of actual or believed \nexercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement or Federal intelligence agency at the \ntime of the alleged crime. \nThe Government requests a  response to our Rule 12.3 demand within the time period \nallowed by the Court for the filing of motions. \nIV. Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility \nPlease contact us at your earliest convenience concerning the possible disposition of this \nmatter or any further discovery which you may request. This Office will oppose the additional \none-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to \nthe Government's initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your \nclient has not entered a plea of guilty four weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether \nor not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial \ndate has not been announced by the Court four weeks in advance of the trial. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00025244\n\nPage 7 \nPlease be advised, however, that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, \nno plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives \nof the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not \nreduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not \nconstitute a \"formal offer\" or a \"plea offer,\" as those terms are used in Lafier v.  Cooper, 132 S.Ct. \n1376 (2012); Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012). \nVery truly \nyours, \nGEOFFREY S.
