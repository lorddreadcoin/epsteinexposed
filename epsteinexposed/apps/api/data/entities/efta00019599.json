Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nMarch 29, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nMark Cohen, Esq. \nCohen & \nGresser LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East Tenth Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nBobbi \nStemheim, Esq. \nLaw Offices of \nBobbi C. Stemheim \n33 West 19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear \nCounsel: \nWe write in response to your March 8, 2021 letter, which requests the disclosure of: \n(1) documents produced to Radar Online in the matter of Radar Online v.  FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 \n(PGG); (2) \"any other FOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation \nof Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\"; and (3) \"any materials that reflect the involvement of \nthe FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation.\" We address each request in turn \nbelow. \nFirst, you have requested that we produce to you all materials that were produced to Radar \nOnline pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") in connection with the civil lawsuit \nRadar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG). As an initial matter, your letter fails to articulate any \nlegal basis for that request under Rule 16, or any other law governing criminal discovery. \nMoreover, to the extent that you assert that you need to know when information received by Radar \nOnline through FOIA may have been published by the media, any information about the date of \npublication would presumably be publicly available and, in any event, not information within the \nGovernment's possession, custody or control. \nEFTA00019599\n\nPage 2 \nNotwithstanding the above, we have been informed by an attorney in the General Counsel's \nOffice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that all materials produced pursuant to the FOIA \nrequest made in connection with Radar Online v.  FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG) are publicly available \non the FBI's website: https://vault.fbi.gov. Furthermore, and without conceding any obligation to \ndo so, as a courtesy, we will provide you with the cover letters that accompanied the productions \nto Radar Online. The Government is providing materials stamped with control numbers \nSDNY GM 02743189 through SDNY_GM_02743292 under separate cover. \nSecond, you have requested that we search the files of the prosecution team' for \"any other \nFOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation of \nJeffrey \nEpstein or \nGhislaine Maxwell and produce to us the documents made public through the FOIA requests, the \ndates the documents were produced and the identity of the recipient of the documents.\" Your letter \noffers no legal basis for this request, and in the absence of further explanation for your request, we \nsee none. FOIA concerns public disclosure of agency records; it  has no bearing on whether \ninformation is subject to discovery in criminal or civil cases. See, e.g., NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & \nCo., 421 U.S. 132, 143 n. 10 (1975) (\"The Act is fundamentally designed to inform the public \nabout agency action and not to benefit private litigants.\"). In particular, to the extent this request \nseeks the identity of any individual or entity who made a FOIA request, along with corresponding \ninformation about how the Government acted on such a request, we are unaware of any basis in \nlaw for such a request, and we invite you to point us to such authority. To the extent this request \nseeks materials produced in response to any FOIA request pertaining to any investigation of \nEpstein, we are similarly unaware of any basis in law for such a broad request. Our discovery \nobligations are not governed by FOIA but instead by Rule 16 and rules applicable to criminal \ndiscovery, all of which we have complied with and intend to continue complying with fully. \nAccordingly, we are not producing materials in response to your request at this juncture. \nThird, you have requested that the Government \"produce any materials that reflect the \ninvolvement of the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation.\" In response, the \nGovernment is providing materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02743143 through \nSDNY\n-  \nGM r  02743188 in response to this request as a courtesy. This production should not be \ntaken to indicate that the Government believes it has any obligation, under Rule 16 or otherwise, \nto do so; rather, we make this production as a courtesy in response to your request. \n'  Your letter erroneously asserts that the FBI's Florida office is part of the prosecution team in this \ncase. We would direct you to our October 7, 2020 letter to the Court, in which we detailed the \nentities that are part of this prosecution team. \nEFTA00019600\n\nPage 3 \nFinally, we have considered the concern you have raised regarding the language in our \nOctober 7, 2020 letter and have filed a letter with the Court addressing the matter. \nVery truly yours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nby:  /s \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nEFTA00019601",
