Ghislaine Maxwell -opens \nWe (finally!) have our jury. Preliminary instructions are happening now, anMy ill open after lunch, around 1:45. Come \nsupport! \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Nov 28, 2021, at 9:59 A ote: \nThere are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place \nin 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. \nIt is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors \nwill do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine \nMaxwell sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her \naccountable. \n\"Swill open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. \nMain courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 \nOverflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a \nvery small monitor with a live feed just for our office. \nTiming: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and \nopening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early. \nAssistant United tates Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nEFTA00022181",
