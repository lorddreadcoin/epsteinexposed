In addition to written reports, the physical and verbal incidents should have been captured on the \nhand-held \ncamera, used constantly to surveil Ms. Maxwell. \nThis is not the first time Ms. Maxwell has been touched inappropriately by MDC staff, as MDC records should \nreflect. \nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell make this report to put the MDC on notice: \nShould Ms. Maxwell be further assaulted and threatened, we will file an official complaint with the Attorney \nGeneral's Office \nand notify the Court. This will further blemish the BOP's reputation, already tarnished by negligence \nresulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The restrictive conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention in the MDC \ncorrelate directly to the Epstein debacle in the MCC, making unprovoked rough treatment of Ms. Maxwell \nbaffling. \nBe further advised, should Ms. Maxwell face any retaliation as a  result of this email, \nthis too will be promptly reported. \nEFTA00013277\n\nBOBBI C.
