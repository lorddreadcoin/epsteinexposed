Berman \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nc/o \nAssistant nited tates Attorne \nE-mail: \nRe: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request) \nJane Doe v. Indyke et al., SDNY Case No. 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF \nDear Mr. \nPlease be advised that we represent the plaintiff in the above-referenced litigation who is \nhereby submitting this written request for documentary and tangible evidence relating to the U.S. \nGovernment's investigation concerning Jeffrey E. Epstein's repeated acts of sexual abuse against \nour client, Jane Doe.' See United States a rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). We \nbelieve that such evidence is currently in the possession, custody and control of the Department \nof Justice \n(\"DOJ\") \nand are highly relevant to Doe's above-referenced civil matter. \nThis written request is submitted pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq., known \ncolloquially as the \"Touhy\" regulations. Because this request is directed to DOJ employees, \ncompliance is subject to the Touhy process, and for that reason we have not affected formal \nservice of process and hope that it  will be unnecessary. \nSummary of Information Sought and its Relevance to the Proceeding \nDoe's civil case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation by notorious \npedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein. It all started in 1994 when 13-year-old \nDoe met Epstein at a summer camp in Michigan. Doe was Epstein's first known victim and was \nTo protect her anonymity, our client has elected to file her action as a Jane Doe and will be \nreferred to simply as \"Doe\" in this letter. The prosecutors handling the Epstein case and any and \nall related ongoing investigations in your office, however, are aware of our client's true identity. \n11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 700 • Los Angeles, California 90025 • 310.477.1700 phone • 310.477.1699 fax • www.psblaw.com \nEFTA00020090\n\nThe Honorable Geoffrey S. Berman \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nc/o \nAssistant United States Attorney \nJune \n8, 2020 \nPage 2 \nPANISH \nSHEA \n& \nBOYLE, ,\n, \nsubsequently abused by Epstein for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and \npsychological trauma and distress. \nThe United States ultimately investigated and brought charges against Jeffrey E. Epstein \nfor sexual abuse of minors and violations of federal law. We believe the government's \ninvestigation spanned several years and collected copious amounts of information and \ndocuments regarding Jeffrey E. Epstein and his victims, including Doe. \nAs summarized below, we request the production of documentary and tangible evidence \nrelating to Doe which was obtained during the government's investigation of Epstein and that is \ncurrently in the government's possession. This evidence is highly relevant to Doe's civil case as \nit  will likely provide information regarding Epstein's liability and Doe's significant damages. \nSpecifically, we seek copies of the following documents currently in the possession of the \ngovernment: \n1. All photographs of Doe \n2. All flight logs stating Doe's name \n3. All videos of \nDoe \n4. All correspondences between Epstein and his agents, employees and/or attorneys \nand \nDoe \n5. All records of purchases of airline tickets on behalf of Doe \n6. Jeffrey E. Epstein's Trust Agreement of The 1953 Trust dated August 8, 2019 \n7. Jeffrey E. Epstein's Epstein's 1953 Trust \n8. Any and all other documentary materials relating in any way to Doe \nDisclosure is \\\\ \ndi\n-ranted \nUnder 28 C.F.R. \n& \n16.26 \nPursuant to the DOJ's Torthy regulations, the Deputy or Associate Attorney General \nassesses the following considerations in determining whether disclosure is warranted: \nEFTA00020091\n\nThe Honorable Geoffrey S. Berman \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nc/o \nAssistant United States Attorney \nJune \n8, 2020 \nPage 3 \nPANISH \nSHEA \n& \nBOYLE, ,\n, \n(a)(1) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the \ncase or mater in which the demand arose; \n(a)(2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of privilege. \nThis request satisfies both of these considerations. As explained previously, the requested \nnon-privileged documentary evidence directly concerns the allegations in Doe's civil case. \nAdditionally, \nDOD's \nToithy regulations prohibit disclosure, subject to certain \nexceptions, \nif any of the following factors exist: \n(b)(1) Disclosure would violate a statute, such as the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C.A. 6103 \nand 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, F.R.Cr.P., Rule 6(e), \n(b)(2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation; \n(b)(3) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified \nby the originating agency, \n(b)(4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative \nagency and the source or informant have no objection, \n(b)(5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement \npurposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques \nand procedures the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired, \n(b)(6) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets without the owner's consent. \nThis request does not implicate any of the above considerations. The requested \ninformation is within the scope of ordinary subpoena practice and does not seek disclosure of \ninformation prohibited by statute or regulation, nor information that is classified or that would \nreveal the source of an informant. \nTo the extent any of Doe's requests seek the investigatory records compiled for law \nenforcement purposes, Doe does not request investigatory records that would interfere with \nongoing enforcement proceedings. \nExpedited \nResponse \nEFTA00020092\n\nThe Honorable Geoffrey S. Berman \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nc/o \nAssistant United States Attorney \nJune 8, 2020 \nPage 4 \nPANISH \nSHEA \n& \nBOYLE, ,\n, \nDoe's civil case is actively being litigated and the parties have already requested and \nexchanged initial discovery. Moreover, a victim compensation fund has been recently \nestablished that Doe may elect to participate in. Accordingly, Doe respectfully requests that the \nDOJ expedite the production of these requested documents to assist her obtain long-awaited \njustice for the atrocities committed against her. \nVery truly yours, \nPANISH SHEA & BOYLE \nC9661/2 0•\"• \nRobert S.
