As discussed, we wanted to follow up with you via \nemail about a possible meeting with Ms. —it sounded like it might be convenient to do a meeting next week \nwhile you're in New York, if that would work for her? If so, if you could give us the dates and time ranges that might be \npossible, we can coordinate on scheduling on our end as well. And of course as always we're happy to address any \nquestions that you or she might have in advance. \nthanks very much, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00026783",
