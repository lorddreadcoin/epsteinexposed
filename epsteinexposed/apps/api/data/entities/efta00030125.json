I've also included the articles of incorporation for four of the relevant entities referenced in the transfer \ndocuments. It appears that we obtained at least some of these documents pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Let me \nknow if you need us to distinguish between the documents that we found through without a subpoena and those we \nobtained via subpoena. \nWe do not have documents for the New Mexico property, as far as I can tell, but I'll chat with the team about tracking \nthose down. Please let us know if there are any other materials you need us to find as well. \nThanks, \nEFTA00030125",
