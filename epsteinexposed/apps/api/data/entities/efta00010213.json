I need to prep with him on 12/7, an e s not vaccinated, so \nwe'll need to get him a COVID test before he can testify. Given that plan, I'd like to have him fly in the evening of 12/6 and \nout on the evening of 12/9. \nIt is very important that _not run into or any of their family. is ex, and they do \nnot know that is coming up to NY to testi . So wou you please make sure tha stays at a hotel that is far \naway from anywhere you might put and their kids? \nThanks so much, \nEFTA00010213",
