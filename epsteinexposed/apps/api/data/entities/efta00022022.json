On number #2, yes that is certainly my memory of the interview, and we included that information in the \npros memo. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesda , June 30, 2021 11:32 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: MCC guards \nHi, \nTwo things: \n1. The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs \n2. According to the notes of his interview with us, said he knew but did not tell anyone that was \nreleased or Epstein was without a cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the captain or warden to put \nsomeone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know tha was gone and \ndenies his prior statement. Do you have a  recollection of this interview? If so, Lyeson wants to know if we think the \nnotes/MOI are correct. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District \nof New York \nEFTA00022022",
