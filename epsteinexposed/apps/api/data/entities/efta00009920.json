    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: BOBBI\nCc: \nSubject: RE: \nGhislaine Maxwell 02879-509 \nDate: Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:06:58 +0000 \nBobbi, \nThank you for including me on this email. I understand from my conversation with MDC legal counsel today that MDC \nstaff is continuing to monitor temperatures throughout the facility, including in the area where Ms. Maxwell is housed. My \nunderstanding is that the temperature where Ms. Maxwell is housed remains within the limits prescribed by BOP policy \nand that the MDC does not expect this week's activities to affect the temperature in Ms. Maxwell's cell. That said, they will \ncontinue to monitor the temperature and take appropriate action if it falls below prescribed limits. \nAs has previously been conveyed via letter from the Government to defense counsel dated October 8, 2020, the MDC's \nassessment continues to be that Ms. Maxwell's current cell is the most appropriate placement for Ms. Maxwell both for her \nsafety and the security of the institution. \nFinally, you have referenced a court order directing that certain steps be taken by the BOP. The only order of which I  am \naware is Judge Nathan's order dated August 25, 2020, which denied Ms. Maxwell's request for an order concerning the \nconditions of confinement at the MDC (See Dkt. No. 49 at 2-3). Please let me know if there is a different order to which \nyou are referring. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \nSent: Monday, November 16, 2020 9:50 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 \nGood afternoon-\nI am informed that the NYC Dept. of Design & Construction will shut off \nwater and heat to the MDC from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am beginning tonight until 11/21. \nI am further informed that the MDC will give inmates one bottle of water \nand an extra blanket due to this disruption of services. \nI am requesting that my client - Ghislaine Maxwell (02879-509) \nbe moved from her present isolation cell with two exterior walls to an interior cell. \nPlease explain why she cannot be moved to the cell in the \ndayroom area where, by Court order, she is permitted to review discovery \nfrom 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. \nThank you-\nBobbi C.
