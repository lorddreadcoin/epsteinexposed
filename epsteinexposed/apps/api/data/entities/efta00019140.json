    "text": "\n\nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM \nTo:' \nCc: \nSubject: \nGhislaine Maxwell (02879-509) \nDate: Sun, 01 Nov 2020 17:41:16 +0000 \nGood \nafternoon-\nI write to request immediate assistance for Ghislaine Maxwell. \nThere are many conditions and restrictions placed upon her at the MDC \nthat are of great complaint, but of immediate concern are conditions within \nMs. Maxwell's isolation cell. \nThe combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement \nin her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable. \nHer request for an extra blanket has been denied. \nHer request for use of her day mug for water has been denied. \n(She's been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.) \nHer request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied. \nThe moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security \nof her legal work. \nYou have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court. \nTrust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented \nindividuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in \nMCC's 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I  have never witnessed \nsuch inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. \nThe mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, \nand the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better. \nFor today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe \nfrom the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. \nThe rest will be left for another day. \nPlease assist. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
