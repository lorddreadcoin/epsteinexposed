Or else sometime in the fall when covid is totally gone since Doud is old. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 2:31 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Doud trial \nSo maybe we aim for a mid-July date for Doud, if defense can do it? And assuming you can still do it. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 2:19 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Doud trial \nHere's my chaotic summer schedule: \n- 5/24: U.S. v. Steve Bannon et al (3-4 weeks probably) \n- 6/21: U.S. v. Noel (MCC Epstein guards) (1 week) \n- 8/16: U.S. v. Adams (MCC guard bribery) (1 week) \n- U.S. v. Lev Parnas et al (2-3 weeks) = was scheduled for March but judge moving it to some times in August — October \n2021. I'll know in the next week or two what the date is. \nI'm not thinking I'll be able to do all of these. Doud would be top 3 trial for me but probably not #1. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 1:40 PM \nTo: (USANYS) <> \nSubject: Doud trial \nHi -  Remind me of your schedule this summer for trial.
