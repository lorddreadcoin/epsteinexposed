She has now had to recount her interactions with \nEpstein one too many times, and since it's her understanding that it's unlikely that any of her information would \nin fact materially advance your current prosecutions, she'd prefer to forego another interview. \nHope that's ok on your end, and of course let us know if you have any questions at all. \nMariann \nEFTA00018021",
