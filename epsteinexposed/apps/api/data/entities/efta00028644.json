Maxwell \"Motion FILED for hail\" \nDate: Tue, 18 May 2021 05:14:20 +0000 \nAttachments: Maxwell renewed bail motion.pdf \nAfter the Circuit rejected her prior bail appeal, Maxwell filed the attached \"renewed motion\" in the Circuit in the same \ndocket. Can anyone think of a reason she can't do that? Even if it's not procedurally proper, it probably doesn't get us \nmuch, as she could just file a new notice of appeal from AJN's latest order and then file the same motion in the Circuit... \nFrom: cmecf@ca2.uscourts.gov <cmecf@ca2.uscourts.gov> \nSent: Monda Ma 17 2021 4:50 PM \nTo \nSubject: 21-770 United States of America v.
