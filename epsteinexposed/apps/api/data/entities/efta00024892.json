GHISLAINE MAXWELL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 26, \n2021 \nDate: Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:24:40 +0000 \nImportance: High \nAttachments: 11-23-21_Trial_logistics_order.pdf \nInline-Images: image001.png \nBefore circulating this shortly, just wanted to check to see if any other orders or info \nworth including have \nhappened between Wednesday and today? Thanks! \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nSouthern District of New York \nPRESS GUIDANCE \nFriday, November 26, 2021 \n*ADDITIONAL OFF-THE-RECORD GUIDANCE: Please note the Court has ruled that several of the \ngovernment's witnesses, who are not alleged victims themselves, may testify under pseudonyms because the \ndisclosure of their identities would ostensibly reveal the identities of the alleged victims. I  believe most, if not \nall, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and again \nurge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. \nIf convicted, Ghislaine Maxwell faces the following statutory maximum penalties; however, her sentence would \nultimately be at the sole discretion of the judge: \n■ \nCount One: conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which \ncarries a maximum sentence of five years in \nprison; \n■ \nCount Two: enticing a  minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a \nmaximum sentence of five years in prison; \n■ \nCount Three: conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal \nsexual activity, which carries a  maximum sentence of five years in prison; \nEFTA00024892\n\n• Count Four: transporting a  minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, \nwhich carries a  maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; \n• Count Five: conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, which carries a statutory \nmaximum of 40 years in prison; and \n• Count Six: sex trafficking of minors, which carries a statutory maximum of five years in \nprison. \nA trial logistics order from Judge Nathan is also attached. \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nSouthern District of New York \nPRESS GUIDANCE \nTuesday, November 23, 2021 \n*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses \nwill be testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion \n/attacked/ requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged \nsensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which \nthey have been victims. I  believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex \ncrime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their \nprivacy. \n9:30 a.m. —  Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell —  the defendant is charged in connection to \nconspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity —  before Judge \nAlison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood \nMarshall U.S. \nCourthouse]). \nEXHIBITS: Government exhibits will be provided exclusively through the SDNY file share.
