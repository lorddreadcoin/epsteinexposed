BERMAN \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nTuesday, \nNovember 19, 2019 \nhttp://www.justice.gov/usao/nys \nCONTACT: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nDOJ OIG \nFBI \nCORRECTIONAL OFFICERS CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING RECORDS \nON \nAUGUST 9-10 \nAT THE METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER \nDefendants Allegedly Created Records Falsely Attesting to Required Checks of Inmates the \nDefendants Never Did in the Special Housing Unit on the Night Inmate Jeffrey Epstein \nCommitted Suicide \nGeoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, \nMichael Horowitz, the U.S. Department of \nJustice \n(\"DOJ\") Inspector General, and William F. \nSweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (\"FBI\"), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging federal \ncorrectional officers TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS with making false records and \nconspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful \nfunctions of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (\"MCC\"), a Manhattan detention facility that \nhouses federal inmates. NOEL and THOMAS surrendered this morning. The case is assigned to \nSouthern District of New York U.S. District Judge \nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: \"As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure \nthe safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. \nInstead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms \nto hide their failures. These defendants will now be held accountable for their brazen attempt to \nshirk their responsibilities and conceal their conduct.\" \nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said: \nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: \nEFTA00017912\n\nAccording to the Indictment' filed today in Manhattan federal court: \nOn August 10, 2019, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly failed to complete mandated \ncounts of prisoners under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\"). Instead, for \nsubstantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, \nand moved around the common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to complete their \nduties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications attesting to having conducted \nmultiple counts of inmates that they did not do. As a result of those false statements, the MCC \nbelieved prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of the \ndefendants' conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from \napproximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which \ntime, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had \ncommitted suicide while unobserved earlier that morning. \nBackground on Relevant Individuals & Entities \nThe MCC is a federal administrative detention facility located in Manhattan that is run by \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons. The MCC employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is \nto ensure the care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. NOEL has been \nemployed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016, and THOMAS has \nbeen employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. Both NOEL and \nTHOMAS were regularly assigned to work shifts in the SHU at the MCC. \nCorrectional officers assigned to guard inmates in the SHU —  and throughout the MCC \n—\nare required to conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to \nensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for within the MCC. Two officers are required to \ncomplete the institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU, and are further \nrequired to document their performance of the count on an official MCC form called a count slip. \nIn addition to the institutional count, MCC correctional officers assigned to the SHU are required \nto complete rounds every thirty minutes to ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for \nwithin his cell. Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form \ndocumenting the date and time of each 30-minute round in each area of the SHU. \nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking \ncharges, and was subsequently assigned to the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and safety \nconcerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Epstein was transferred to suicide \nwatch and then psychological observation. Upon being moved back to the SHU on July 30, \n2019, the MCC took steps to guard against future suicide attempts by Epstein, including by \nassigning Epstein to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk. Conducting the required \ninstitutional counts and thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's procedures \nfor ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. \nThe Events of August 9-10, 2019 \nOn August 9, 2019, NOEL was assigned to work in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, \nAs the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment \nset forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. \nEFTA00017913\n\n2019 to 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. THOMAS was assigned to work with NOEL in the SHU \nfrom 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. From 4 p.m. on August 9 to 8 a.m. on August 10, \nthe officers on duty in the SHU, including NOEL and THOMAS, were responsible for \nconducting five institutional counts at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 9, and at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., \nand 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL and THOMAS were also responsible for completing forms \nattesting to the completion of each of those counts. In fact, NOEL, and then NOEL and \nTHOMAS, repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts in the SHU. Instead for substantial \nportions of their 12-8 a.m. shifts, in particular, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed \nthe intemet, and moved around the common area of the SHU. During that time period, NOEL \nand THOMAS were the only correctional officers assigned to the SHU. Aside from two other \nofficers who briefly visited the common area of the SHU, as confirmed by video surveillance, no \none else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds throughout the night, and no \none entered the area in which Epstein was housed. \nTo conceal their failure to complete their duties, NOEL signed false certifications \nattesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., and NOEL and THOMAS \nsigned false certifications attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and \n5 a.m. when, in truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result of those false \nreports, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored and accounted \nfor when, in fact, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from \napproximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which \ntime, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of Epstein, who had committed suicide by \nhanging himself earlier that morning while unobserved. \nNOEL, 31, and THOMAS, 41, are each charged with one count of conspiring to defraud \nthe United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and \nto make false records, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. NOEL is also \ncharged with five counts of making false records, and THOMAS is also charged with three \ncounts of making false records, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in \nprison. \nThe statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are \nprovided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be \ndetermined by the judge. \nMr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of DOJ OIG and the FBI. \nThis case is bein handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. \nAttorneys are in charge of the \nprosecution. \nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendants are \npresumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. \n19-XXX \nEFTA00017914",
