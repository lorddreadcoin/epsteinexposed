We may deem it \nnecessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree \nto maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we \ndeem necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account \nto satisfy any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account. \nAs long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of \nbusiness to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we \ncarry for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to \nourselves or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for \nsuch Property. \nWhen you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in \nyour account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short \nsales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions.
