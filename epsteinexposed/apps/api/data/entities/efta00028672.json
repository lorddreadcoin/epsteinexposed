He gets frustrated, but then gets the job done. I suggest a training session for the paralegals so \nthey all hear the same exact instructions. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Monday, October 19, 2020 3:33 PM \nTo: (USANYS)> \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Copies \nHit \nI just spoke with about this. They had originally thought the paralegals could make the copies, but they tried \nand couldn't, so they asked to. The CART analyst assigned to the Epstein/Maxwell case is out of the office today and \ntomorrow, and they don't have anyone else who can make copies. The discovery deadline is 11/9, but the team is asking \nthe reviewers to finish by 10/31, so that they have time to review the responsiveness coding and make copies for \nproduction. The team is worried that if the reviewers don't start within the next day or so, they won't have enough time \nfor the review. When spoke with =, he said he could get it done; we're deeply appreciative of the help and \nsorry to monopolize so many office resources in service of this discovery deadline. Happy to discuss further by phone (I'm \navailable by cell anytime, .  Thanks \nM. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nc\nSent: Monday, October 19, 2020 3:17 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: Copies \nis making them. I guess the FBI backed out. \nWhat is the real deadline to get the full review finished? \nEFTA00028672",
