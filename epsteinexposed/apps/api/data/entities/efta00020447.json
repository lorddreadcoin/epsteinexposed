We realize that it is unlikely your office is involved, \nbut we \nthought that we should inform the government of the following so you can \ntake whatever action you believe is \nappropriate. \nJhonny Contreras was \nrecently returned to the SHU in the MCC. At the \ntime of Mr. Epstein's death, it is my understanding that Mr. Contreras was \nhoused \nin a cell on the same tier and across the hall from Mr. Epstein's \ncell. Mr. Contreras did not see Mr. Epstein hang himself, but he would be \nwilling to speak to investigators, in the \npresence of counsel, about his \nobservations. \nEFTA00020448\n\nPlease let us know if there is anything further we should do \nto follow-up. \nAndy \nAndrew G.
