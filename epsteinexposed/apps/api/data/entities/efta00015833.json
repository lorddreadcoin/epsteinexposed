I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things \ntomorrow: \n•  The older contains just one report, and I think that goes in the folder instead. \nPlease move it and delete his folder. Same thing for the folder. \n• are the same person an t  e  o ers can be merged under the name \n• is the same person as =M, a potential testifying witness. Could you please move those \nmaterials and delete the folder? \n•  The stuff in the folder should actually go in the folder, and you can delete \nthe one for once the stuff is moved over. \n•  In the folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a \nnew, NTW folder for him? \n• could you please \nmove ese o e not-a-wi ness o er you create . e ea wit t  e con en s  a  er, u not in the context of \nthe NTW production. \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00015834",
