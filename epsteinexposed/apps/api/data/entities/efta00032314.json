I just got a renewed scheduling order giving us March 4th off. So, no issue \nfor next week. \nBut, I am obviously still curious about your progress. We have deliberately sat on the sidelines since your appointment, \nbut have quite a  bit of information, documents, emails, est that may be relevant depending on your needs. \nBruce A.

I asked the Court (EDNY) \nfor March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly that there \nwas a Curcio issue. That application was denied. \nSo, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from our \nfirm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make another \nEFTA00032314\n\nrequest or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than address the \nCurcio issue. \nThank you. \nBruce A.
