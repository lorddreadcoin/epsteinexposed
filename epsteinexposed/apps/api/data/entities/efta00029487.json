I \nrealize that this is a big project and that there's only so much that can be done, but it poses almost insurmountable timing \nhurdles for our team if it is taking 1-2 months for PAE to get us stuff we ask for out of Relativity. In most of our cases, this \none included, that eats up a huge chunk of the time we have available to produce discovery. \nWe'll follow up early next week to see if there is a more concrete update, but I think this may require a broader or higher \nlevel explanation to the Court. I am concerned about requiring our team to take the hit with Judge Nathan for missing \nthis deadline. \nFrom: (USANYS) \n<\nSent: Friday, October 30, 2020 12:51 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: FW: Phone Call Follow-Up \n(USANYS) \nSome of the data is being sent to use today by FedEX. However, there is a  ton of stuff still being processed. That stuff is \nstill being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to He thinks it is not possible to \nmeet the November 9 date. He thinks the next step might be done on Tuesday, and then a better estimate of completion \nmight be possible. \nFrom: Koontz, Nicholas [US] < \nSent: Friday, October 30, 2020 12:25 PM \nTo: (USANYS) a> \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <\n> \nSubject: Phone Call Follow-Up \nGood Afternoon M: \nEFTA00029487\n\nFollowing up on our earlier phone conversation, a hard drive with the following productions is being sent to SDNY via \nFedEx with the following productions in the US v.
