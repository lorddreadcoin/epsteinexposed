My thoughts in track. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 3:01 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: \n1.c>; \nSubject: RE: draft response to Epstein defense preservation requests \n(USANYS) \nC \nThis has been in the works for a little while, due to various other things that have come up in the interim, but we didn't \nwant it to get lost given the discovery motion schedule. The attached is based on our conversations with M, including \nhis email with suggested language for the prefatory language, and responds to the two attached defense letters. Happy to \ndiscuss anytime and to incorporate comments and suggestions. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00016601",
