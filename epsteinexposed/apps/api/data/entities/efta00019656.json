Thanks. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Gadher, Dipesh\" < \nDate: July 20, 2021 at 3:17:20 PM EDT \nTo: \"Biase, Nicholas (USANYS)\" \nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell update \nDear Nick \nI hope this email finds you well. Since we last spoke, \nI wanted to check a few things with you if I may on the Ghislaine Maxwell case: \n1) Is it correct to say that there will now be TWO trials - the first on the child sex trafficking charges (covering the \nperiod 1994-2004) and the second on the 2016 perjury charges? \n2) Is the main trial still scheduled to start in November? \n3) Is there any date set aside for the perjury trial? \n4) What does this mean for the maximum sentence that Maxwell can now receive? I think we previously talked settled \non up to 80 years behind bars. \n5) Is the investigation into Maxwell and Epstein's network still ongoing? \nEFTA00019656\n\n6) If so, does Prince Andrew remain a person of interest? Have US prosecutors managed to get a statement from him \nyet or are there any arrangements in the pipeline to do so? \nI'd be grateful if you could drop me line with some responses within the next 48 hours if at possible please.
