Stewart, Matthew Goldstein and Jessica Silver-Greenberg \n7/31/19 \nJeffrey E. Epstein, the wealthy financier who is accused of sex trafficking, had an unusual dream: He hoped to \nseed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. \nMr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar \nwith his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition. \nMr. Epstein's vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the \nscience of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial \nintelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of \nimproving the human race through controlled breeding. \nMr. Epstein, who was charged in July with the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14, was a serial illusionist: \nHe lied about the identities of his clients, his wealth, his financial prowess, his personal achievements. But he \nmanaged to use connections and charisma to cultivate valuable relationships with business and political leaders. \nInterviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the \nsame tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in \neugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. \nLawyers for Mr. Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges, did not respond to requests \nfor comment. \nMr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist \nMurray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen \nHawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and \nbest-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be \naltered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate. \nThe lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some \nof the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, \nand even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. \nScientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, where Dom Perignon and expensive \nwines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at Harvard's Program for \nEvolutionary Dynamics, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation. \n2 \nEFTA00018467\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nOthers flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his \nprivate island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. \nEpstein had chartered. \nThe Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he was invited by colleagues — including Martin \nNowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss — to \n\"salons and coffee klatsches\" at which Mr. Epstein would hold court. \nWhile some of Mr. Pinker's peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an \"intellectual \nimpostor.\" \n\"He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack,\" \nMr. Pinker said. \nAnother scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, Jaron Lanier, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual \nreality, said that Mr. Epstein's ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous \nproof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. \nMr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. \nEpstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. \nMr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was \nbankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you. \nAt one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor \nbecause doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had \nrebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have \nmore children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been \n\"voted off the island\" and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein's gatherings. \nThen there was Mr. Epstein's interest in eugenics. \nOn multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his \nambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and \nwould give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and \nwealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it. \nIt was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a \ngathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. \nOne of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other \nrecalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin \nIslands. \nThe idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the \nlaw. \nOnce, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a \nscientist who told him that Mr. Epstein's goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-\n3 \nEFTA00018468\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nsquare-foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as \nworking at NASA, but he did not remember her name. \nAccording to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts \nof the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted \nto strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. \nThe repository discontinued operations in 1999.) \nMr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the \ndinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen \ncandidates to bear Mr. Epstein's children. \nMr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA. \nOne adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier's interest in cryonics, an \nunproven science in which people's bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told \nthis person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. \nSouthern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it \nwas engaged in DNA analysis. Calls to Southern Trust, which sponsored a science and math fair for school \nchildren in the Virgin Islands in 2014, were not returned. \nIn 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which \nnow operates under the name Humanity Plus. The group's website says that its goal is \"to deeply influence a \nnew generation of thinkers who dare to envision humanity's next steps.\" \nMr. Epstein's foundation, which is now defunct, also gave $100,000 to pay the salary of Ben Goertzel, vice \nchairman of Humanity Plus, according to Mr. Goertzel's résumé. \n\"I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now,\" Mr. Goertzel said in an email to The New York Times. \"The \nstuff I'm reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings \nand kinks were. Yecch.\" \nAlan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of law at Harvard, recalled that at a lunch Mr. Epstein hosted in \nCambridge, Mass., he steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved \ngenetically. Mr. Dershowitz said he was appalled, given the Nazis' use of eugenics to justify their genocidal \neffort to purify the Aryan race. \nYet the lunches persisted. \n\"Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his \nmoney,\" said Mr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein's defense lawyers in the 2008 case. \nLuminaries at Mr. Epstein's St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. Hawking and the Caltech theoretical \nphysicist Kip S. Thorne. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, \nrecalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated \nwith how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans. \n4 \nEFTA00018469\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nMr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary \nagent whose best-selling science writers include Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond. Mr. \nBrockman did not respond to requests for comment. \nFor two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a series of salons that matched his scientist-authors with \npotential benefactors. (The so-called \"billionaires' dinners\" apparently became a model for the gatherings at Mr. \nEpstein's East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.) \nIn 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif, where Mr. Epstein \nwas introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. \nEpstein to be \"charming\" and to have \"interesting ideas,\" although they \"turned out to be quite vague.\" \nAlso at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman's Edge Foundation, \nwere the Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, who was accompanied by his mother. \n\"All the good-looking women were sitting with the physicists' table,\" Daniel Dubno, who was a CBS producer \nat the time and attended the dinner, was quoted as saying. Mr. Dubno told The Times that he did not recall the \ndinner or having said those words. \nMr. Brockman was Mr. Gell-Mann's agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 \nbook \"The Quark and the Jaguar,\" thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support. \nHowever impressive his roster of scientific contacts, Mr. Epstein could not resist embellishing it. He claimed on \none of his websites to have had \"the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists,\" including Mr. Pinker, \nMr. Thome and the M.I.T. mathematician and geneticist Eric S. Lander. \nMr. Pinker said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. \"Needless to say, I  find \nEpstein's behavior reprehensible,\" he said. \nMr. Thome, who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein's 2006 conference, believing it to be \nco-sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, \"I have had no contact with, relationship with, \naffiliation with or funding from Epstein,\" he said. \"I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving \nminors.\" \nLee McGuire, a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. \"Mr. Epstein \nappears to have made up lots of things,\" Mr. McGuire said, \"and this seems to be among them.\" \n5 \nEFTA00018470\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nSome of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida \nSouth Florida Sun Sentinel \nBy Marc Freeman \n7/30/19 \nFinancier Jeffrey Epstein has been branded a pervert and an abuser, but not all of his victims want to see him \nprosecuted further in South Florida. \nSome of the girls Epstein assaulted at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 have already reached financial \nsettlements with him and fear they'll lose their anonymity. Federal prosecutors — the ones who approved his \nlenient plea deal to begin with — say they fully support that position. \nEpstein faces separate federal sex trafficking charges in New York, but the debate about prosecuting him in \nSouth Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West Palm Beach is considering whether to \nstrike down parts of a controversial 2007 deal that gave him and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from \nfederal charges. \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement violated the \nfederal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark about it until after it had \nbeen finalized. \nMarra must decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for two \nof Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. \nThe victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are \nlong overdue charges in Florida. \n\"To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New \nYork,\" their lawyers wrote. \"But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's \ncrimes in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large.\" \nLawyers for the U.S. government disagree. \nThey concede that prosecutors back then \"fell short\" of treating victims properly as they reached a settlement \nwith Epstein. But the attorneys now contend \"the past cannot be undone\" and the deal must be upheld under the \nlaw. \nAmong their arguments is that many victims clearly want to let it go, because they are content with financial \nsettlements they obtained from Epstein, and his 2008 guilty plea to two state prostitution charges. That plea \nresulted in 13 months in Palm Beach County Jail and registering as a sex offender. \nThe prosecutors say they reached this position based on \"conversations\" with the victims and their lawyers, \nwithout giving a specific number. \nAttorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice in April. \n6 \nEFTA00018471\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \n\"She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail,\" Kuvin said. \"She said, `I don't know if that's a \nrealistic possibility, but that's what I  want.'\" \nHe said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. \n\"When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be \nhandled,\" Kuvin said. \"But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come \nforward ... is enough to put him away.\" \nThe federal prosecutors explained that while some victims \"would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, \nthey valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in \nany criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or \nthe public.\" \nThis is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, \nwrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. \nKitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. \nBut they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still \"exacerbates the harm to \nvictims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim.\" \nKuvin said he agrees, \"It's a valid concern for some of the victims.\" \nAttorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's \nreasoning to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. \nLawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to \nprosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. \nThe lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the \nprosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. \n\"The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no \ncredence from the Court,\" wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane \nDoe 1 and Jane Doe \n2. \nThey also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged \"risk\" to some victims outweighs \nobtaining justice for their clients. \n\"But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous,\" they wrote this \nmonth. \nEpstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal \nshouldn't be blown up to allow new charges. \nJeffrey Epstein faces `a million pages' of evidence: defense lawyer \nNew York Post \n7 \nEFTA00018472\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nBy Andrew Denney and Bruce Golding \n7/31/19 \nProsecutors have 1  million pages of evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyer revealed in court Monday—\nwithout shedding any new light on the jailhouse incident that left the convicted pedophile with bruises on his \nneck. \nNo marks were visible on Epstein's neck, and he never appeared to be in pain during the 15-minute hearing in \nManhattan federal court. \nThe judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled Epstein's trial for June 2020 after a prosecutor said the \nchild sex-trafficking charges against him should be resolved as \"swiftly as possible.\" \n\"We don't think any delay in this is in the public interest,\" Manhattan Assistant US Attorney said. \nEpstein's trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the defense will have all the prosecution's \nevidence \nagainst the multimillionaire financier by Oct. 31, she said. \nDefense lawyer Martin Weinberg objected to starting the trial before September 2020, saying, \"We need time to \nreview a million pages of \ndiscovery.\" \nBut Judge Richard Berman said he was blocking out time in June 2020 on the presumption that the defense \nwould be ready by then. \nWeinberg didn't make any mention of the July 23 incident in which law enforcement sources have said Epstein, \n66, was found sprawled on the floor of his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he's being held \nwithout bail. \nWeinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. \nEpstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. \nHe's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 —\nin his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. \nBerman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal \nof a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution \nagreement that Epstein struck in 2008 with then-Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta. \nThat deal was exposed last year in an award-winning series of stories by the Miami Herald, and controversy that \nerupted following Epstein's July 6 arrest forced Acosta to resign as President Trump's labor secretary. \n8 \nEFTA00018473\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nJeffrey Epstein appears in court for first time since reported jail injuries \nThe Guardian \nBy Victoria Bekiempis \n7/31/19 \nFinancier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in \nhis sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. \nHe wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday \nmorning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. \nThere were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly \npresented than at some previous hearings. \nThe Jeffrey Epstein scandal \nHis lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, \nwhich \nfocused on scheduling issues. \nProsecutor \nasked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: \"We don't think that any \ndelay in this case is in the public interest.\" \nThe Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens \nof minor girls\" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. \nThe disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. \nEpstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald \nTrump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship \nwith Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. \nEpstein and the Miami US attorney's office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in \n2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. \nUnder this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than \nif he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this \nagreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump's labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. \nEpstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender \nfollowing the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. \nIn rejecting Epstein's request, Judge Richard Berman said, \"the government has established danger to others \nand to the community by clear and convincing evidence\", adding: \"I doubt that any bail package can overcome \na danger to the community.\" \n9 \nEFTA00018474\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nEpstein's lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. \nLate last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors' proposed protective order, which will keep \ncase materials relating to \"the government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals\" under wraps. \n10 \nEFTA00018475\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nJudge sets tentative date for Jeffrey Epstein's trial \nAssociated Press \nBy Larry Neumeister and Jim Mustian \n7/31/19 \nA subdued Jeffrey Epstein listened passively in court Wednesday as a judge said he won't face trial on sex \ntrafficking charges before June 2020, and more likely a few months afterward. \nThere was no mention at the Manhattan federal court appearance or any visible sign of injuries after the 66-\nyear-old financier was found on the floor of his cell last week with neck bruises. \nEpstein's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, refused to say what might have left his client with neck bruises after the \ncourt hearing. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney urged a June trial date for the man accused of arranging to have sex with \ngirls as young as age 14, saying there is \"a public interest in bringing this case to trial as swiftly as possible.\" \nBut Weinberg said the case is far from \"ordinary,\" adding the defense team won't be ready before Labor Day \n2020. He said prosecutors delayed bringing charges that relate to alleged crimes that occurred in the early 2000s \nat Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Florida. \nU.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said a trial projected to last four to six weeks could tentatively begin \nJune 8, but he'll likely defer to defense lawyers' needs if they are not ready. \nEpstein's demeanor in court was noticeably different from previous appearances, when he was actively engaged \nwith his lawyers and looking through papers. \nOn Wednesday, he sat quietly, his hands folded in front of his face through much of the 20-minute proceeding. \nOccasionally, he looked toward courtroom artists and reporters seated in a jury box. \nEpstein has remained at the Metropolitan Correction Center, which is adjacent to the downtown Manhattan \ncourthouse. \nHe has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges that carry the potential for up to 45 years in prison. \nBerman refused bail after concluding he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors have said \nthey fear he might try to influence a growing number of witnesses who support charges that he recruited and \nabused dozens of girls in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. His lawyers had argued he should be \nallowed to stay under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion. \nHis lawyers say an agreement reached with federal prosecutors a dozen years ago disallows the charges and \nthey say he has committed no new crimes. \n11 \nEFTA00018476\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nThe lawyers agreed to file written arguments about the agreement and double jeopardy claims by Sept. 13. Oral \narguments will occur in October. \nThe non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related \ncharges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to \nmany victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, \nsix days a week. \nEpstein was arrested July 6 when he arrived at a New Jersey airport on a private jet from Paris, where he has a \nhome. \n12 \nEFTA00018477\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nDid Jeffrey Epstein try to kill himself? He and his lawyer, back in \ncourt, aren't saying \nMiami Herald \nBy Miami Herald Staff \n7/31/19 \nVictims of Jeffrey Epstein share the emotional toll that sexual abuse has taken on them — even years after the \nabuse occurred. Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown interviewed the young women, most speaking for the \nfirst time about Epstein. BY EMILY MICHOT I  JULIE K. BROWN \nFor the first time since he was found semi-conscious in his jail cell with telltale bruise marks on his neck, \naccused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared in a Manhattan court room. \nEpstein — onetime friend of the rich and powerful, including current President Donald Trump and past \nPresident Bill Clinton — learned Wednesday that he will not face trial until at least next June. \nThe multimillionaire part-time resident of Palm Beach sat subdued in front of U.S. District Court Judge Richard \nM. Berman. The 66-year-old defendant wore dark blue jail scrubs and glasses. \nHis lawyer, Martin Weinberg, declined to reveal any details about the incident at the Metropolitan Correctional \nCenter, which occurred July 23, including whether it was a suicide attempt, an attack by a fellow detainee or \nsomething else. His client is being held without bond. \nWednesday's hearing in New York City lasted just 15 minutes. \nEpstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was \narrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year \ninvestigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment \ndespite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. \nHe had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him \nand took him into custody. \nDuring the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using \nrecruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that \nthey would receive $200 to give a man a massage. The girls have alleged that they were coerced into sex. \nThe girls were paid additional money if they would recruit others girls, police and court records allege. Epstein \nhad assistants schedule as many as three visits a day. \nRather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to \nminor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the \nlockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This \"work \nrelease\" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the \nPalm Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the work release. \n13 \nEFTA00018478\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nAlthough Assistant U.S. Attorney said it is important to move swiftly ahead with Epstein's court \ncase, his defense attorney said he needs time in light of the approximately one million pages of documents that \nthat comprise the evidence collected against his client. \nLabor Secretary Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his role in handling the Jeffrey Epstein sexual \nabuse case. Acosta was a U.S. Attorney who approved the Epstein plea deal in 2008. By CSPAN \nIn the meantime, Epstein will be given a chance to argue that the non-prosecution agreement, executed in 2008, \ngave him, his schedulers, his alleged madam and others immunity from federal charges and that the new \ncharges constitute impermissible double jeopardy. \nIn its series of articles, the Herald highlighted the role of Alexander Acosta, then-U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, in approving the immunity agreement, including a controversial stipulation that Epstein's \naccusers not be told of the arrangement. Facing searing criticism after Epstein's arrest, Acosta resigned his post \nas President Trump's labor secretary. \n14 \nEFTA00018479\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nJeffrey Epstein could face sex trafficking \ntrial next June \nReuters \n7/31/19 \nFinancier Jeffrey Epstein could go to trial on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as \nearly as next June, though his lawyers told a court on Wednesday they may need more time. \nAt a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein \nasked that it wait another three months. \nThe lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected \nto total more than 1  million pages. \nU.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tentatively set aside time for a trial beginning June 8, but \nrevisit the issue later. He said he normally allowed defendants more time to prepare if they wished. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney said a trial is expected to last four to six weeks. \nProsecutors have accused Epstein of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude \"massages\" and \nother sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others. Epstein has pleaded not guilty. \nWednesday's hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries \nin his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan. \nEpstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on \nthe reports after the hearing. \nEpstein is appealing Berman's July 18 denial of his request to remain under house arrest in his $77 million \nmansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side while awaiting trial. \nThe charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. \nThey followed Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice \nDepartment's agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges. \nEpstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is \nnow widely considered too lenient. \nHis lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing \nthe current case over the same conduct. Weinberg said at Wednesday's hearing that they intended to file \nmotions on the issue. \nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar. \n15 \nEFTA00018480\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nEpstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages \nBloomberg \nBy Chris Dolmetsch ,  Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado \n7/31/19 \nJeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have \ngathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors \nand conspiracy. \nProsecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said \nhis team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the \ngovernment. \n\"We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial,\" \nWeinberg said during a brief hearing in Manhattan on Wednesday. \"We need time to assess events that occurred \n14 to 17 years ago.\" \nThe judge set a tentative trial date of June 8 and asked the parties to keep him updated on their progress. \nEpstein, who didn't speak in court, was arrested on July 6 after stepping off his private plane in New Jersey \nfrom a trip to Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and said he has fully complied with the law for more than 14 \nyears. \nMarks on Neck \nEpstein is accused of molesting teenage girls from 2002 to 2005. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state \ncharges of soliciting prostitution, after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Federal prosecutors \nin New York say they are not bound by the deal as they now pursue their own charges. \nIn court Wednesday, there was no discussion of what happened to the 66-year-old Epstein last week at New \nYork's Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been held since his arrest. People familiar with the \nmatter said he was found injured and unresponsive in his cell, with marks on his neck. Authorities are \ninvestigating whether he was assaulted, possibly by another inmate, or whether the injuries were self-inflicted. \nWeinberg declined to respond to questions about the incident outside court. \nAlso in court was Gloria Allred, the activist lawyer who has represented women accusing Roy Moore, Bill \nCosby and President Donald Trump of sexual assault. After the hearing, she said she was representing other \nEpstein accusers who \"were not in the Florida case.\" She said other women have approached her about their \nexperiences with Epstein but were reluctant to discuss them for fear of retaliation. \nThe U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, has urged others who may be victims to come forward and \ncooperate with the government. Allred declined to say whether her clients have spoken to prosecutors. \nThe case is U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). \n16 \nEFTA00018481\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nCollins \nEditorial: Failures of \nethics \nBuffalo \nNews \nBy News Editorial Board \n7/29/19 \nThe ethics specialists are right and so are the members of a special ethics panel, including both Democrats and \nRepublicans, who are paying attention. Good for them. The conduct of Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, exposed \na range of issues Congress needs to treat as tumors, and cut them out. \nCollins was indicted last year on allegations of insider trading. But he was routinely smashing ethical standards \n—  of both formal and common sense varieties —  before he was ever charged with a crime. \nA year before Collins was indicted, the Office of Congressional Ethics reported that it found \"a substantial \nreason to believe\" that Collins violated federal law by touting the stock of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an \nAustralian biotech firm, based on inside information. \nThe office also said Collins may have broken House ethics rules by persuading National Institutes of Health \nofficials to meet with a staffer from that company. \nAt least as troubling are the actions Collins took that were not deemed to be ethical violations. Speaking to a \nbipartisan House task force charged with drawing up new ethics rules based on Collins' arrest, ethics experts \nworried about lawmakers who sit on the boards of privately owned companies, or who serve as partners in other \nbusinesses or who are directors of nonprofit organizations. Collins still does all three. \nEarlier this year, in response to Collins' arrest, the House barred lawmakers from serving on the boards of \npublicly traded companies. Collins did that, too, as a board member —  and leading stockholder —  of Innate \nImmunotherapeutics. It's how prosecutors say he obtained the insider information that led to his arrest. \nThere was more. Collins authored a provision of the 2016 \"21st Century Cures Act\" that sped drug approval for \ncompanies like Innate. Collins, with a straight face, claimed there was no conflict because Innate had no \nbusiness before U.S. regulators. But in 2017, the company practically beamed that it had \"received clearance \nfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application \nlodged last month.\" \nThe fact that Collins' role in the legislation could also have benefited other companies —  and may even have \nbeen worthy of passage —  does nothing to change the associated fact that he was pushing for legislation whose \nadoption could have lined his pockets. It was classic self-dealing. \nThe drug in question was meant to treat multiple sclerosis. It failed in clinical trials in 2017 and prosecutors say \nCollins illegally spread the word to family and others who were able to sell their stock before its price collapsed \non the bad news. \nCollins has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is scheduled for February. But regardless of what a judge \nor jury ultimately decides about Collins, he has shown himself to be indifferent to the need for a member of \n17 \nEFTA00018482\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nCongress to conduct himself in a way that reflects well on the institution and on the voters who entrust him with \npublic \noffice. \nIn that, he has shown Congress that it needs to act. It can't count on its members using good judgment, \nespecially when millions of dollars are at stake. \nThe good news is that it seems ready to meet that public obligation. It is considering measures that would \nprohibit lawmakers from serving as partners in limited liability corporations, joining committees that oversee \ntheir business interests and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. Staff members would also be \nbarred. \nSadly, some Republican members have defended Collins, despite the clear conflicts of interest. But the \nRepublican on the ethics task force, Rep. Van Taylor of Texas, expressed no disagreement with the panel's \nDemocrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who said she expected to move \"rather quickly\" on writing new \nrules. \nTaylor sees the tasks as \"very narrow,\" focused on preventing lawmakers from serving in outside positions that \ncould pose conflicts. The remarkable thing is that those restrictions need to be put in writing. Thank Collins for \nthat. \n18 \nEFTA00018483\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nSecurities and \nCommodities Fraud \nStewart \nSouthern District Will Pursue A Retrial Of \"Silver Platter\" Case \nForbes \nBy Walter Pavlo \n7/30/19 \nSean Stewart was indicted on insider trading charges back in May 2015 during U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's \nreign over the Southern District of New York. Now, over four years since his indictment, Sean can reflect back \non a wild journey of being convicted, sentenced to 3 years prison, having that conviction overturned, being \nreleased from prison halfway through his term and, now, having a new date to go back to trial to face the \ncharges again. \nSean Stewart was indicted on insider trading for passing material non-public information on potential deals to \nhis father, Robert, who then passed it on to his former friend and trader, Richard Cunniffe. Sean, a Yale \ngraduate who had worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, mentioned some \ndetails about his work while talking to Robert. Sean's information made it to Cunniffe who made over a million \ndollars on the trades, sharing a small amount (less $100,000) with Robert. How much did Sean make on the \ntrades? ZERO dollars. He had no idea that Cunniffe traded because he did not even know who Cunniffe was. \nIt was a clear case of misappropriation where information was used without Sean's knowledge, so it was not a \n\"classical\" insider trading case. However, Bharara's team of U.S. attorneys was looking for cases that targeted \nwealthy Wall Street traders who seemed to have an advantage over the average trader. Sean's case was a good \nfit. \nCunniffe was busted by the FBI and soon became a government informant, taping calls and other meetings with \nRobert. In one of those calls, Robert stated that Sean said of the information he had passed on to Cunniffe, \"I \ncan't believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest.\" So the primary evidence in the case, \nthe case that came to be known as the \"silver platter\" case, was based on a statement that was attributed to Sean. \nIt's a phrase that Sean's new defense team wants to be excluded from the proceedings. \nWhen Robert was arrested, under duress of FBI questioning, he said nine (9) times that Sean was not in on his \nscheme with Cunniffe (here is entire tape transcript here). Robert also admitted his own role and that of \nCunniffe's during the interrogation. When it came to trial, neither that tape nor Robert's testimony was allowed \nbecause of legal maneuvering by prosecutors. The video tape was suppressed and Robert did not testify due to \nthreats from prosecutors that he would be charged for peijury due to his conflicting accounts. Here is what the \njury missed from that tape: \nFBI AGENT: Tell me about the first time that Sean gave you information on a deal. \nROBERT STEWART: Well, uh, I wouldn't characterize any of these as — I mean Sean would mention stuff. \nI don't think he had any idea that I would trade on any of this stuff. Uh, I've never mentioned that I did, to him. \nUmmm \n19 \nEFTA00018484\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nAGENT: If that's true, how do you explain the comment you made to Rick [Cunniffe] that Sean got angry with \nyou when he gave you this information on a silver platter and you didn't invest. \nROBERT: Uhh, I think I was just saying that to Rick because Sean said, oh, you know, ahh, all these deals, you \nknow, you — if you were trading you could make like millions of dollars. And I said, you know, Sean, no \none's going to trade and make millions of dollars on this stuff. That wasn't his intention. \nRobert took the 5th but did submit an affidavit that if he were to testify he would have said Sean did not know \nabout the trades by Cunniffe. \nLooking back at the trial, there was not a single email, document, or text message that suggested that Sean was \na knowingly participated in the trading scheme. This is interesting since there were so many incriminating \ndocuments between Cunniffe and Robert. There were no witnesses who gave testimony on Sean's knowledge \nand intent, including Cunniffe, the cooperator, who on the stand acknowledged that he never knew Sean. \nFurtnermore, trading records and actions undertaken by Sean suggest he did not know trading had taken place. \nLast fall, the 2nd Circuit overturned Sean's conviction, something rare in most cases, especially a reversal on an \nevidentiary ruling, which suggests the 2nd Circuit felt that Sean may be innocent and the judge's mistakes \nresulted in an unfair trial. The appellate court ruled that Robert's post-arrest video interrogation should have \nbeen allowed. Sean was released from prison and has been in legal limbo until the SDNY decided that they \nwould move to move forward with another trial on the same charges. \nStewart will have a new judge this time around. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain was replaced by Judge \nRakoff, a man who seems to be on a mission to define insider trading laws himself. He also has new attorneys \nSteven M. Witzel, Lawrence Gerschwer, R. David Gallo and Leigh G. Rome of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & \nJacobson LLP. \nIf Sean is found guilty, he would face the prospect of being sentenced to prison and returning to prison to \ncomplete a term. On the other hand, it would not be out of the question for Judge Rakoff to give him \"time \nserved\" in prison even if Sean is found guilty. Rakoff, not a  fan of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, seems to \nbe one of those judges that uses common sense in his approach to sentencing. Earlier this week, Rakoff \nsentenced a man to 14 months in prison for knowingly leaking insider information on Sherwin Williams' \nacquisition of Valspar. \nWhile Sean may have made some mistakes, these could have been handled by the companies he worked for \nand, at the most severe, an enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SDNY seems \nintent on trying to interpret insider trading laws by putting on elaborate trials with the threat of putting people in \nprison for years. It is a waste of resources. \nIt looks like the ghost of Bharara still haunts the SDNY. \n20 \nEFTA00018485\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nThompson \nEaston man accused of stealing $7M via fake Bitcoin transactions \nLehigh Valley Live \nBy Sarah \nCassi \n7/30/19 \nAn Easton man who headed a cryptocurrency escrow company was arrested last week on federal charges he \nallegedly stole $7 million from two companies by lying about Bitcoin transactions. \nJon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a \ncryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market \nMaking \nLCC. \nThe 48-year-old Thompson was arrested in Easton, and was charged with two counts each of commodities fraud \nand wire fraud. Easton police assisted in serving the arrest warrant at 6:15 a.m. Thursday at Thompson's West \nBurke Street home on College Hill. \nWhat happens to the money when a criminal's stash is in bitcoin? \nWhen a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value \nof the virtual currency. \nThompson was released after posting $500,000 bond. Messages left for comment at a phone number listed for \nThompson and for his defense attorney, Matthew Siembieda, were not immediately returned. \nProsecutors said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-\npeer digital currency Bitcoin -- $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second. \nThompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no \nrisk of default, prosecutors allege. \nIn June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send Volantis more than $3 million for a \nBitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and \nthat money could not be lost. \nThompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, \nprosecutors said. \nThompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company's money but in \nreality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first \nreceiving any of the Bitcoin in hand. \nIn July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for \nBitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party \nwithout first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege. \n21 \nEFTA00018486\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nThompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said. \n\"Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis \nMarket Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase,\" \nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a news release. \"As his clients soon realized, however, \nThompson's representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they \nhad entrusted with him because of his lies.\" \nFBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized \ncompanies didn't understand, and he \"allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency.\" \n\"Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest \nin Bitcoin,\" Sweeney said. \nThe complaint doesn't identify the companies allegedly victimized by Thompson. \nForbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading \ncryptocurrencies, gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf. \nSymphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned. \nIn that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, \nreached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the \nfirst settlement payment, Forbes reported. \n22 \nEFTA00018487\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nPinto-Thomaz \nPopular Paint Brand Insider Trading, Results In Prison Term: Feds \nPatch \nBy Chris Dehnel \n7/30/19 \nA former analyst for a major financial ratings agency is to spend more than a year in prison for an insider \ntrading scheme involving his hairdresser, a jeweler and two major paint brands sold prominently in Connecticut. \nGeoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York, announced that \nSebastian Pinto-Thomaz, 34, a former credit ratings analyst at Standard & Poor's, was sentenced in Manhattan \nfederal court to 14 months in prison for participating in two schemes to trade on material, nonpublic information \nin advance of the Sherwin-Williams Company's acquisition of the Valspar Corporation. \nValspar is the brand sold by \nLowe's. \nPinto-Thomaz was convicted on April 26, following a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who \nalso imposed Monday's sentence. \nIn summarizing the case, Berman said, \"As an employee of Standard & Poor's, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz was \nprivy to potentially lucrative information about business acquisition plans. Instead of protecting that \ninformation, as he had sworn to do, he shared it with a friend and with his hairdresser. In turn, they bet on a \nstock that they knew to be a sure thing, and raked in nearly $300,000 in profits. Pinto-Thomaz painted himself \ninto a corner when he and his co-defendants exploited insider information to reap illegal profits. Now they all \nface time in prison for their misdeeds.\" \nWhen a company announces an acquisition, the acquiring company often seeks the opinion of a credit rating \nagency regarding the potential impact that the acquisition could have on the acquiring company's \ncreditworthiness, Berman said. Therefore, companies often contact rating agencies before an acquisition is \npublicly announced in order to secure the rating agency's views on how a possible acquisition could impact a \ncompany's credit rating, he said. \nAll major rating agencies offer a service — sometimes known as a Rating Evaluation Service, or RES — that \nprovides the company with a rating committee decision with respect to a proposed acquisition. \nIn March 2016, Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, assigned Pinto-Thomazto work on a \nRES for the Sherwin-Williams Company in advance of its contemplated but unannounced acquisition of the \nValspar Corporation, according to casae records. \nIn connection with the assignment, Pinto-Thomaz received material, nonpublic or \"inside\" information the deal \nabout Sherwin-Williams's planned acquisition of Valspar prior to the public announcement of the acquisition. \nS&P's written policies prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which included the \ninside information, Berman said. \nDuring his tenure at S&P, Pinto-Thomaz reviewed and certified his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to S&P \nand its clients, according to case records. \n23 \nEFTA00018488\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nIn March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz passed the inside information about the paint merger to Jeremy Millul, a friend, \nand to Abell Oujaddou, his hairdresser, so that they could \"use it to make profitable trades in Valspar stock and \noptions.,\" Berman said. \nOn March 21, 2016, the first trading day after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Valspar \nstock increased approximately 23 percent over the prior day's close. \nMillul, a Manhattan jeweler opened a brokerage account on March 13, 2016, and shortly thereafter purchased \n480 shares of Valspar common stock, case records show. On March 18, 2016, the last trading day before the \nacquisition was publicly announced, Millul also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, according \nto case \nrecords. \nAfter the acquisition was publicly announced, Millul sold his Valspar stock and options for approximately \n$106,806 in profits, Berman said. \nOujaddou, a Manhattan hairstylist and salon owner who has known Pinto-Thomaz for years and is a close friend \nwith his mother, was given inside information during a haircut on March 8 or 9, 2016, according to case \nrecords. On March 10 through March 18, 2016, Oujaddou, who had never previously purchased Valspar or \nSherwin-Williams purchased 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, \ncase records show. \nAfter the acquisition was publicly announced, Oujaddou sold his Valspar shares for approximately $192,080 in \nprofits, according to case records. \nFollowing the trading, Oujaddou met Pinto-Thomaz in the paint aisle of a hardware store and paid him a \nkickback, Berman said. \nPinto-Thomaz denied having a relationship with anyone on the list of pre-merger trading. \nIn addition to his prison term, Pinto-Thomaz was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to \npay a fine of $15,000 and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $7,500. \nMillul and Oujaddou each previously pled guilty and were to be sentenced on July 30. \n24 \nEFTA00018489\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nNarcotics \nCastro \nDrug Dealer Forfeits Over $4M in Bitcoin as Part of a Guilt) Plea \nAll Stocks \nBy Ravi Rd \n7/31/19 \nAccording to a July 25 press release from the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New \nYork, the very active Bitcoin drug dealer Richard Castro has pleaded guilty of committing illicit activities such \nas money laundering and distributing three controlled substances through the dark web and encrypted emails. \nCastro was charged by the US Department of \nJustice \n(DoJ) and agreed to forfeit more than $4 million including \ncryptocurrency funds available in his seven different Bitcoin wallets. \nCastro, 36-year-old based in Windermere, Florida, operated under multiple badges, such as \"Chems_usa,\" \n\"Chemical_usa\" and \"Jagger109\" to distribute three controlled opioid substances namely carfentanil, fentanyl, \nand phenyl fentanyl. Dream Market and AlphaBay were two of his primary market places on the dark web, \nwhere he sold drugs in exchange for cryptocurrency. \nThe three controlled opioid substances were sold from November 2015 to 2019 by Castro and another co-\nconspirator, Luis Fernandez. Fentanyl, the first of these three is considered to be significantly stronger than \nheroin while Carfentanil is believed to be 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Castro sold these substances under \nthe three aforementioned monikers which ultimately used to prove that he is indeed the leader of this \nconspiracy. \nOn Dream Market, Castro once boasted about 3,200 transactions that he had completed on various dark web \nmarketplaces. Out of these 3,200 transactions, 1,800 transactions were successfully completed on AlphaBay \nalone. The conspirators apparently also received many positive reviews for the quality of synthetic opioid \nsubstance they were selling. \nIn June 218, Castro informed his clients that he would only accept orders received by encrypted emails and \ndeclared the organization is getting the business off from the dark web. Customers who wanted to buy narcotics \nhad to acquire the address of the encrypted email from \"Chems_usa\" by paying certain fees. Unfortunately for \nCastro, an undercover law enforcement officer also obtained the encrypted email and placed an order, which \nultimately led to his arrest. \nCastro was accepting the payments in Bitcoin which were later distributed in seven different BTC wallets. \nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: \n\"As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful \nopioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the intemet, \nand use online pseudonyms to deal drugs —  like thems_usa' and `Chemical_usa.' Thanks to our law \nenforcement partners, thems_usa' is now in U.S. prison.\" \n25 \nEFTA00018490\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nCastro has agreed to forfeit $4,156,198.18 including the funds on those seven Bitcoin wallets. \n26 \nEFTA00018491\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nRochester Drug Company \nDistributor Has Been Shipping Excess Opioids to Small Towns \nLegal Reader \nBy Sara E. Teller \n7/31/19 \nMiami-Luken Inc., an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and four people including two former executives have \nbeen charged with selling millions of pills amid the opioid epidemic despite knowing the dangers. The \nindictment charged the Springboro, Ohio-based company; Anthony Rattini, the company's former president; \nJames Barlay, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with \"conspiring to distribute controlled \nsubstances.\" Prosecutors have alleged \"Miami-Luken ignored obvious signs that drugs were being diverted to \nillegal users and dealers between 2011 and 2015.\" The company was shipping 4.9 million pills to Miller-\nWest's drugstore in Oceana, W.Va., where the population is just under 1,400. \n\"Miami-Luken and the executives failed to guard against the dangerous drugs it was shipping to pharmacies in \nfive states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement \nAdministration,\" they added. \nThe distributor shipped millions of pills to desolate and rural areas of Appalachia which was hit especially hard \nby the epidemic. \"Records show Miami-Luken also distributed 3.7 million hydrocodone pills from 2008 to \n2011 to a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 400 people,\" prosecutors said. The pharmacists \ncharged were Devonna Miller-West, the owner of Oceana, West Virginia's Westside Pharmacy, and Samuel \nBallengee, owner of Williamson, West Virginia's Tug Valley Pharmacy. \nThe company was also shipping some to other \"unnamed pharmacists and physicians,\" the indictment alleged. \n\"There's a need, in my opinion, to devote sufficient charges right here and now to stop the dying,\" United States \nAttorney Benjamin C. Glassman said, adding investigators found \"many overdose deaths that could arguably be \nlinked to the conduct of people accused in the conspiracy.\" \nIn April of this year, criminal charges were brought against Rochester Drug Co-operative. Geoffrey S. Berman, \nthe United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in \nCharge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the \ncharges. Rochester Drug Co-Operative is one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. \nCharges were also filed against Laurence F. Doud III, the company's former chief executive officer; and \nWilliam Pietruszewski, the company's former chief compliance officer. The indictment was specifically for \n\"unlawfully distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA,\" according to court \ndocuments. \nBerman said at the time, \"This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and \nthe distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the \nopioid epidemic that is ravaging this country. Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this \nepidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms.\" The \ncompany paid $20 million to resolve the charges. \n27 \nEFTA00018492\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nDEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said, \"Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the \npharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication.

Berman said in a release. \"Kickbacks to doctors can alter or compromise their judgment \nabout the medical care and services to provide to patients, and can increase healthcare costs.\" \nFor the first two counts of violating the False Claims Act —  which are against Life Spine, Butler and Greiber —\nthe plaintiff is seeking treble damages and civil penalties to the maximum amount allowed by state law. \nFor the third count of unjust enrichment —  which is only against Life Spine —  the plaintiff is seeking damages to \nthe extent allowed by law. \nThe plaintiff also is seeking pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and any other relief the court deems \nappropriate. \n29 \nEFTA00018494\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nA statement from Life Spine said that both parties are engaged in discussions and look forward to resolving the \nmatter. \n30 \nEFTA00018495\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nMatters of \nInterest \nThe U.S. said a California cherry-picker went to Pakistan for terrorist training. Now the case has \ncollapsed. \nWashington Post \nBy Meagan Flynn \n7/31/19 \nIt was a month after 9/11, and Osama bin Laden's face flashed across the news on Naseem Khan's TV screen. \nThe FBI was sitting in his living room in Bend, Ore., and Khan sensed an opportunity. The agents had come for \nan entirely different purpose and were ready to leave — until Khan pointed at the screen and said he thought he \ncould help with something else. A few years ago, he said, he saw bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-\nZawahiri, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, at a mosque in the wine-country town of Lodi, Calif. \nThe agents perked up, intrigued by the possibility. Had they really just stumbled into a hot tip on al-Qaeda \nwhile speaking to a 28-year-old McDonald's worker and convenience store clerk? The FBI thought Khan was \nonto something — a possible \"sleeper cell\" of terrorism hidden in Lodi — and decided to dispatch him there as \na confidential informant. \nKhan wouldn't find any associates of Zawahiri at the mosque in Lodi, and U.S. officials and terrorism experts \nnow doubt his initial claim about Zawahiri was ever true. But Khan would find 19-year-old Hamid Hayat —\nwho would soon become the face of homegrown terrorism in post-9111 America. \nThey met at the mosque, and Khan learned Hayat was taking a trip to Pakistan with family. Over and over, in \nrecorded conversations, he returned to the same question: Would Hayat commit to attending a terrorist training \ncamp, as he had promised? \nNow, a judge's order on Tuesday casts doubt on whether Hayat ever actually did. \nHayat, a cherry-picker and son of an ice cream truck driver, was convicted of attending the alleged terrorist \ntraining camp and sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2006. Prosecutors, relying on Khan and Hayat's own \nstatements, alleged that he attended the camp for three to six months sometime in 2003. The case would become \none of the most high-profile examples of the government's fight against terrorism in the immediate aftermath of \n9/11, especially because Hayat, after hours of interrogation by FBI agents, confessed to attending the camp. \nBut on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated his conviction and sentence, finding that \nHayat had inadequate defense during the 2006 trial while casting doubt on the facts of the case. Burrell \nquestioned whether jurors would have convicted him had they heard evidence from witnesses in Pakistan, \nwhich the judge said likely would have \"undermined\" jurors' confidence in Hayat's confession alone. His \nattorneys have maintained the confession was coerced during an exhausting interrogation. \nHad the defense attorney actually interviewed any witnesses in Pakistan who spent significant time with Hayat \nduring his trip, she would have discovered that they recalled Hayat spent most of his time playing video games \nand cricket and that the purpose of his visit was for his family to find him a wife, according to Burrell's order. \nNo one identified any prolonged disappearance that would have allowed him to visit a terrorist training camp \nfor three to six months as prosecutors alleged and Hayat said in the confession, Burrell noted. Burrell, who \n31 \nEFTA00018496\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \noversaw Hayat's original trial, found the witnesses gave consistent statements and could have provided Hayat a \ncredible alibi. \n\"Showing that Hayat could not have been at a jihadi training camp for the `period of months' specified in the \nindictment would have been completely consistent with the defense that Hayat's confession should not be \ncredited and the government lacked other supporting evidence,\" a U.S. magistrate wrote in making the \nrecommendation that Hayat's conviction be vacated. Burrell adopted most of the magistrate's findings of fact. \nThe government has not decided yet whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's \noffice in the Eastern District of California said in a statement, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"We are in the \nprocess of reviewing the district court decision and assessing what steps, if any, should be taken and \nconsidering all our options,\" the statement said. \nHayat, now 36, is currently being held in a federal prison in Phoenix. His attorneys are seeking his immediate \nrelease. \nThe case against Hayat and his father, Umer, who was accused of lying to the FBI, heaped international \nattention on the Northern California town of Lodi. Seemingly overnight, the town went from the zinfandel \ncapital of the world to an alleged terrorism \"sleeper cell\" — a claim authorities would later walk back. \nAt the time he met Khan in August 2002, Hayat lived in his parents' garage and didn't have many friends, as \nthe Intercept recounted in a 2016 investigation. Posing as a radical Islamist, Khan nudged Hayat into \nconversations that were anti-American and supportive of Islamic fundamentalist groups, and to his delight \nHayat went along with it, according to recorded conversations cited in federal court documents. Hayat approved \nof the beheading of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl by Pakistani militants. He told Khan he believed \njihadists had attended his grandfather's religious school in Pakistan and claimed his grandfather was so \npolitically well connected that the Pakistani president enlisted him in efforts to persuade the Taliban to turn over \nbin Laden after 9/11. \nThen came the terrorist camps. Hayat said he had seen one in an online video — and expressed interest in going \nhimself. Khan, feeding the intel to the FBI, egged him on. \nBut once in Pakistan, Hayat kept making excuses, according to the judge's order. When Khan told him he was \nbeing \"lazy,\" Hayat claimed the climate had changed and it got too hot outside — the terrorist camp was \ncanceled, he said. Khan was starting to get mad. His nudges turned to threats. \n\"God willing, when I come to Pakistan and I see you, I'm going to ... force you to, get you from your throat and \n... throw you in the madrassa,\" Khan said in one expletive-laden recorded conversation, as the Intercept \nreported. \n\"I'm not going to go with that,\" Hayat said. \n\"Oh yeah, you will go,\" Khan told him. \"Yeah, you will go. You know what? Maybe I can't fight with you in \nAmerica, but I can beat your a-- in Pakistan, so nobody's going to come to your rescue.\" \nIn their last conversation, according to the Intercept, which obtained all the recordings, Hayat said he \"never \nintended on going to a camp.\" \n32 \nEFTA00018497\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nHayat denied attending a camp in his first interview with the FBI in Japan, before flying to San Francisco. He \nconfessed during his second interview in California upon his return in June 2005. \n\"FBI: Al Qaeda plot possibly uncovered,\" rang a CNN headline in June 2005, saying those involved \"Trained \non how to kill Americans.\" \nMonths after Hayat's arrest, then-director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, testified in a \ncongressional hearing that a \"network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, Calif., for example, maintained connections \nwith Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens.\" \nBut ultimately, no other terrorism cases arose from the investigation except for the one against Hayat. Two \nimams were investigated but were never criminally charged with anything. They had overstayed religious \nworker visas, authorities \ndiscovered. \nA retired FBI agent who watched Hayat's interrogation and the resulting confession told the Los Angeles Times \nit was \"the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I've ever seen,\" believing the agents fed Hayat the \ndetails they wanted to hear and that Hayat repeated them so he could leave. He was barred from offering his \ntestimony at trial. Burrell found that the failure to challenge the validity of the confession by presenting a false \nconfession expert also contributed to his finding that Hayat had ineffective counsel. \nKhan was ultimately paid nearly $230,000 for assisting the FBI over three years. During Hayat's trial, his \ndefense attorney questioned how one fast-food worker's implausible claim that he saw the world's most wanted \nterrorist in a small-town mosque could have \"sparked this whole investigation with this ridiculous claim,\" the \nTimes reported in 2006. \nHayat's attorneys filed an appeal in 2014 and ultimately sought to interview numerous witnesses in Pakistan \nwho could account for his whereabouts during the trip from 2003 to 2005. They appeared for sworn depositions \non video in 2018. When Hayat's attorney, Dennis Riordan, asked his uncle whether he \"would have known\" if \nHayat disappeared from their rural hamlet, Muhammad Anas said, \"Naturally, I would have noticed,\" the \nMarshall Project reported then. \nThe judge found that the witnesses \"corroborated each other on some important points,\" regarding trips the \nfamily took throughout Pakistan and who they visited. Once or twice a month, they traveled to a hospital for his \nmother's medical treatment. \nOn Tuesday, Hayat's family issued a statement applauding the judge's decision to throw out Hayat's \nconviction, the Sacramento Bee reported. \n\"We have been waiting 14 long years for Hamid to be freed,\" the statement read. \"Hamid cannot get those 14 \nyears of his life back, but we are relieved to see the case take such a big step forward. We miss him and hope to \nbe reunited with him soon.\" \n33 \nEFTA00018498\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nFed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2008 Crisis \nNew York Times \nBy \nJeanna Smialek \n7/31/19 \nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday as it attempted to \nguard the record-long economic expansion against mounting global risks. \nThe widely expected quarter-point move, the Fed's first since it cut rates to near zero in 2008, is meant to \nprotect the economy against the potentially harmful effects of a growth slowdown in China and Europe and \nuncertainty from President Trump's trade war. \n\"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation \npressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate,\" according to the Federal \nOpen Market Committee's policy statement. \nBut the Fed did not indicate that this was the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign, suggesting instead that the \ncut was a minor adjustment intended to help the economy weather any challenges from slowing global growth \nand Mr. Trump's trade fights. \nSubscribe to With Interest \nCatch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights, delivered \nSundays. \nWhile Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, left the door open to additional rate moves if the economy showed signs \nof sputtering, he did not indicate the central bank was poised to engage in the sort of deep cutting cycle that the \nFed has done in the past to avert or offset recessions. \n\"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts - I didn't say it's just one,\" Mr. Powell said at a news \nconference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. \"What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to adjust \npolicy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it.\" \nThe widely expected move from the central bank was initially greeted with a shrug in financial markets, where \ninvestors have been factoring in a rate cut for months. But the stock market turned lower after Mr. Powell began \nhis news conference at 2:30 p.m., as investors absorbed the chair's comments as indicating the Fed was unlikely \nto make additional cuts anytime soon, as investors had hoped. \nBy the end of the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. It was the benchmark index's worst decline since \nMay 31. \nThe Fed dropped its target rate to a range between 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Officials also announced an early \nend to its efforts to shrink the Fed's balance sheet, another attempt to keep the economy moving. The central \nbank's holdings of government-backed bonds swelled during the financial crisis as it bought assets to try to \nreinvigorate growth. Policymakers have been slowly siphoning off securities to return their balance sheet to a \nmore normal size, and that process was slated to end in September. It will now conclude Aug. I. \nWhy the Federal Reserve Cut \nInterest Rates \n34 \nEFTA00018499\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nThe move is what's called an \"insurance cut\" — one that central bankers are making to keep growth chugging \nalong. \nBoth Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Esther George, the president of \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against Wednesday's decision, preferring instead to leave rates \nunchanged. Those dissents marked the second and third of \nJerome \nH. Powell's term as chair. \nWhile Fed officials said they expect economic expansion to continue and the labor market to remain strong \n\"uncertainties about this outlook remain.\" \nMr. Powell said the Fed's move was \"intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and \ntrade tensions.\" \nHe said that manufacturing around the world was weakening and that Mr. Trump's trade dispute was continuing \nto spook American businesses. \"The ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their \ncapital spending,\" he said. \nOfficials did not indicate in their statement whether this cut would be followed by additional moves. The Fed's \nJune economic projections suggest policymakers envision cutting rates slightly to shore up the economy, rather \nthan beginning an easing cycle that will return rates to zero. \n\"As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to \nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to \nsustain the expansion,\" the Fed said in its statement, seemingly leaving its options open. \nMr. Powell said the committee viewed the move as a \"mid-cycle adjustment to policy,\" suggesting that the Fed \nsees this cut as more similar to two instances in the 1990s, during which the Fed moved rates down slightly to \nget the economy through periods of uncertainty, rather than the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign. \nThe Fed's rate cut carries political risks, given Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank. Mr. Trump has been \ndenouncing the Fed in speeches and on Twitter for the past year, criticizing its four 2018 rate increases and \nblaming its policies for slowing the American economy. Some onlookers may see Wednesday's move as caving \nto the president. \nThe Fed operates independently of the White House. It attributed the change, which officials have been \nsignaling for months and which investors fully expected, to growing economic concerns. \n\"We also don't conduct monetary policy to prove our independence,\" Mr. Powell said. \nThe central bank is trying to extend a record-long economic expansion, because officials believe that doing so \nwill allow the Fed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and slow but steady inflation. The \nunemployment rate is hovering around its lowest level in 50 years, but that has yet to push wages dramatically \nhigher in a way that forces companies to lift prices more quickly. \nInflation has run shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012. A little \ninflation helps to grease the wheels of a healthy economy, allowing businesses to raise wages faster and lifting \ninterest rates, giving the central bank more room to cut in the event of a downturn. \n35 \nEFTA00018500\n\nSDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 \nPrices picked up just 1.6 percent in the year through June, not counting volatile food and fuel costs. \nWages are growing only moderately. An index of employment costs climbed by 2.7 percent in the second \nquarter from a year earlier, less than expected and a slowdown from earlier in 2019, according to data released \non Wednesday. \nGlobal policy uncertainty has also increased, and manufacturing is slumping the world over. Growth is slowing \nin China and Europe, and Mr. Trump's trade war with China and threats of further tariffs on United States \ntrading partners are stoking uncertainty and causing businesses to hold off on investment. \nThose developments threaten the economic outlook, even as growth remains solid, consumer spending is robust \nand the job market holds up for now. \n36 \nEFTA00018501",
