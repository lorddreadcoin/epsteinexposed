    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: for the AUSA handling the new investigation \nDate: Sat, 10 Aug 2019 21:33:51 +0000 \nWe just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current / latest \ngirlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from \nher lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It sounds \nlike the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new investigation, we \ncan put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00024497",
