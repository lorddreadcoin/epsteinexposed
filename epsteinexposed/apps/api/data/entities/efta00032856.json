I know that we've talked about this in some detail already, but currently counsel for the \nTrustees of his estate are working on thinking about the value of the government's potential claims, in particular relating \nto statute of limitations issues, so we want to make sure we have the best possible arguments to present to them. Sorry \nfor continuing to bother you on this, but we really appreciate the help! \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00032857",
