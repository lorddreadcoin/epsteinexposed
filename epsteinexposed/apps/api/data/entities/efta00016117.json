I'm aware of the obvious differences in institutions (MDC is larger and has more space than MCC) and particular \nunits (the women's unit at MDC being viewed as particularly spacious with its own library, I think) -- and how these \ndifferences probably allow for Maxwell to have substantially more access than a male inmate at MCC. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nTel: \nCell: \nEFTA00016117",
