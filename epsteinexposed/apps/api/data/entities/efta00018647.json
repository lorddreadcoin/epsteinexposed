However, there seem to be some technical issues, \nas they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the 1A Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a \"codec problem,\" meaning there was probably some sort of \nuser error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever \nsent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. \nI'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps.

As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we \nwere hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents \nthat looked like the attached file —  which looks like a photocopy of the CO. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them \nfrom the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent. \nThanks very much, \nEFTA00018648\n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, February 13, 2019 953 AM \nTo: \n(F8\n0 \nCc: (l-ISANTS); \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \nHis \niNn \n(FBI) \nS>: \nWanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to transmit the scanned records to \nS \nbut I'm \nnot sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for \nsure that all the materials you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was included). \nAnother person on our team, \nS \nwho's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via phone her number is \nlet us know if anything would be helpful on our end. \nthanks again! \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 201917:19 \nTO: = \n(IMD) \n(F80 \nCc: \nILISANTS); \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \n(Fe4):•.: \nand please \nFollowing up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact info- I'm reachable at this email address or by \nphone at (office) Or (cell).
