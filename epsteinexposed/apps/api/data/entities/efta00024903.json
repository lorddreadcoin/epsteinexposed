I listed in RED where new info is provided. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursda , November 18, 2021 6:24 PM \nTo: \nCc: (NY) (FBI) \nSubject: Phone Numbers Searched in Relativity \nGood evening-\n(USANYS) \nNYPD) \n> \nRegarding the list of numbers to be queried in Relativity I've completed the first 4. There are several \"hits\" but not all are \nexact matches and need to be sorted through. \nI organized the info in a Word Doc reflecting results under the first section US vs Epstein as \"JE\" and the second part with \nthe search warrants as \"JE SW\". Each positive match has the control number and a brief description of what it consists of. \nAs I continue to work on it I will send it with updated results. \nThanks, \nEFTA00024903",
