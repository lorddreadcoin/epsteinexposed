Our contributions to this case were significant, and we'd ask that for future \npress releases, you include our SAC as an announcing official. Please feel free to reach out with any \nquestions, I'm at 202-579-7511. \nThank you. \nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/priacting-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-correctiona I-officer-\nwho-demanded-bribe \nSenior Public Affairs Specialist \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOffice of the Inspector General \n@JusticeOlG \n@OversightGov \n@COVID Oversight \nEFTA00025270",
