We've since had a number of productive conversations with \nthe folks at OPR you pointed us to, and we think it would be helpful to also make contact with someone at SDFL purely for \nthe purpose of ascertaining what hard-copy materials they still have related to the case down there and how we could \nEFTA00030484\n\nbest arrange to obtain and review copies. We have had very limited contact with an AUSA in the SDFL civil \ndivision who we understand was the primary point of contact on issues related to the CVRA litigation. Do you know, does \nhe remain the best point of contact for the issues we hope to discuss, or is there someone else in that office we should \nreach out to? \nThanks so much, \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 2:33 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \nThursday at noon is perfect.

Among our questions was who, whether at ODAG, SDFL, or NDGA we should be in touch with at this point \nregarding documents.

We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential \ndocument/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were \nlargely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, \nanticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week \nfor a  quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you. \nThanks very much, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nTel. \nEFTA00030486",
