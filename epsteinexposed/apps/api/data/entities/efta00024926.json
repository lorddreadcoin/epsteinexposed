I referred to one of the interviewers as \nUM1 because his full name was never mentioned, but am happy to go back and change that if you know his full name.

I'm helping out with a few things for Maxwell and have been preoccupied with that.

My progress on this transcription has been a little delayed due to some time-sensitive projects that have \ncome up. I'm chipping away at it, but I was wondering if you could give me an idea of when you'd like this transcript by. I \njust want to make sure I'm not delaying you in any way! \nEFTA00024926\n\nThanks so much, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 19, 2021 9:41 AM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nSubject: RE: Shared Access \n>; \nThanks for checking —  that timing sounds good, thanks. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Monday, April 19, 2021 9:40 AM \nTo: \n) cl>; \nSubject: RE: Shared Access \nGood morning, \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nThank you for getting me access! I'm happy to be helping out. I currently have a few things on my plate so I was \nwondering if it would be okay if I started this transcription either at the end of this week or the beginning of next week? \nJust wanted to make sure in case this was super time-sensitive.
