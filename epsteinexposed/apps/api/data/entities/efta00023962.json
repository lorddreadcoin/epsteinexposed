Sorry for the false alarm, but perhaps she just figured out how to open the files she \nwas previously having difficulty with. \nIf I receive any follow up about additional issues, I will let you know. \nAppreciate your responsiveness and willingness to help! \n8/26/2020 3:41 PM >>> \nThere are many different types of files on the drive; excel, pdf, tif, video, audio, etc. Consequently, it will be difficult to \ndiagnose the issue(s) without knowing the specific files/folders that are problematic. If you would send over the particulars \nwe will work to provide a  fix. \nThanks, \nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSDNY \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew \nYork, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, August 26, 2020 3:23 PM \nSubject: RE: delivery of hard drive to MDC for discovery production to inmate \nThanks very much for reaching out.

Staff have reported to me that she has reported that certain files do not work. \nCan you advise what types of files (i.e., video/excel/etc.) are on the drive and what players or applications may be necessary \nto view them? I'm trying to figure out what reasons may be for issues with the material on the drive. \nThank you, \n8/21/2020 9:01 PM >>> \nWe just sent another drive via FedEx. This drive contains all of the discovery in the case to date. The password for the drive \nis (which we also sent in a separate letter). \nYes, these productions contain audio as well as video. \nLet me know if you have any other questions. Have a good weekend. \nBest, \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 14, 2020, at 7:34 AM, wrote: \nThank you for letting \nme know!

Could \nyou please let us know what the current protocol is for that? Also, it's our understanding that hard drives with \ndiscovery materials for inmates needs to be non-encrypted (and not have a password for access), is that also correct? \nWe're hoping to get these materials to her tomorrow if at all possible, so we greatly appreciate your help. And I'm \nreachable any time at f it would be helpful to discuss. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00023965",
