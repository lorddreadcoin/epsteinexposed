It should get there tomorrow. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:30 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: new materials for Maxwell upload to Relativity \nHello, \nI was just checking to see if the hard drive was sent out to arrive today? \nThank you. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 4, 2020 1:48 PM \nTo: \nCc: \n<M>; \nSubject: RE: new materials for Maxwell upload to Relativity \nI know you're on vacation this week, but wanted to very briefly follow up on the below — I'm going to ask to mail \nyou the thumb drive referenced below, which has folders for five devices (NYCO24332, NYCO24369, NYCO24369_1, \nNYCO24372, and NYCO24384) on this coming Monday, so that you'll be around when it arrives (and in case you have to \nEFTA00021893\n\nsign for it). Per usual, if you could please take a look at it when you receive it, and then send on to PAE for processing and \nupload to Relativity, that would be great. Thank you!! \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 04, 2020 13:44 \nTo: \nCc: \n<>; \n>; \nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL EMAIL) - RE: Epstein Evidence status \nFollowing up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the \nthumb drive I received from yesterday with CART materials, NYC027913 is not included, so we are still missing that \none. \nBut I do see that each of the items with the \"Included next round\" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, with \nthose items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. \nIn terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a \nhandful of them (approximately seven total, I think) —  do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials \nfor any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? \nAnd then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted in \ngray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 03, 2020 19:17 \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - RE: Epstein Evidence status \nSony I didn't get back sooner. It's been kinda crazy. I'll answer your questions in order, so match them up. I'm \ngoing off what I can see on miae. \nThe final items were given to She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. \nThe 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, do.tore them. \nI am pretty sure NYCO27913 is included with the items has. If not, please let me know. \nAs far as the old questions, you should have everything now. \nThe zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the \ndirectory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. \nNeed anything further, let me know. \nEFTA00021894\n\nOn Aug 3, 2020 3:33 PM, \" \n\" < \nwrote: \nI know you may still be traveling, but I wanted to check in on a handful of outstanding issues. If you're not available, \nperhaps can assist? \n1. On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us on \nMonday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if so, \nwhen can we get those materials? \n2. There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on \nthe most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know \nwhy those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the \nnew folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already \nreceived them. \n3. One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc \nyou sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet). \nIn case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received \nfolders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow. \nSeparately, we're still waiting on answers to the questions from Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24. To refresh, those \nquestions are: \n4. Comparing your most recent spreadsheet to the prior one, and leaving aside the \"Nothing for Southern\" \ndesignations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're \nlooking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional \ndevices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), \nNYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not \nmissing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc. \n5. As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were \napproximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached \nspreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process? \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, July 24, 2020 15:09 \nEFTA00021895\n\nTo: \nCc: \n>; \n) \nSubject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - RE: Epstein Evidence status \n>; \n>; \nI don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such \nfiles. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be \ncomprehensive. I only recall 1  addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items \nin dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get \nthem to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not \nbe possible. It can be a  very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know. \nOn \nJul 24, 2020 2:20 PM, '1 \n> \nwrote: \nIn addition to the pending questions below, we've been advised by the vendor that is reviewing the initial seven devices \n(that were provided on a per-device extraction basis, as previously discussed) that those materials include approximately \n71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files).
