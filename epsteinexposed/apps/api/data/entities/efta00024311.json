This practice, called \"householding\", applies to account statements, \ntrade confirmations, remittance transfer receipts, personal and financial information required \nto be sent by regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts \nstatements, which provide consolidated information for all of the Accounts in your household. \nHouseholds are determined as follows: \nGO \nAccounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID Number \nare automatically placed in the same household. \ncci Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household \nonly with the express consent of all the Account holders. \nWe mail househeld communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, if \nyou receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or other \nelectronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS Online \nServices can have access to view all Accounts in the household. \nThe composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household mailing \naddress, and the addressee for househeld mailings may also change over time. Where owners \nof joint accounts live at different addresses, househeld mailings will be sent to at least one \nAccount owner's address and may be included with mailings for other Accounts at that \naddress under the conditions described above. \nif you do not want your statements to be \nbundled by household, please contact your \nFinancial Advisor. \nFor more information regarding electronic \ndelivery of periodic communication for your \nAccount, please refer to the Electronic \nDelivery Agreement herein. \nSIOVPUL \nI. \nPON \nZOL \n5500 \nOP \n30 \nEFTA00024340\n\nde \n0055 \n703 \n1405 \n11/14/2018 \nPeriodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain personal \nand financial information to our clients. Because we deliver these records with your \naccount statements, other members of your household may have access to these \nrecords unless you instruct us to send them to you separately. \nIf you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be bundled \nby household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual mailings in \nseparate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means. \nNon-Primary Residence Address for Mailing Purposes \nUnless you notify us otherwise in writing, you authorize us to use the Account address you \nprovided to mail all notices, correspondence and for the disbursement of Property, even if it is \nnot your primary residence.

In connection with any \nCard issued, the respective Cardholder Agreement shall be governed by Federal law and the \nlaw designated by the Card Issuer in that Cardholder Agreement. \nIn the event that any of the Arbitration provisions below are found to be unenforceable, you \nsubmit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the Federal \ncourts sitting in the Southern District of New York for the purpose of determining all matters \nwith regard to the Agreement.

By signing an arbitration agreement \nthe parties agree as follows: \nGO \nAll parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, \nincluding the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the \narbitration forum in which a claim is filed. \nao Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court \nreverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. \nao The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other \ndiscovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. \nao The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an \neligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all \nparties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. \nto The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or \nare affiliated with the securities industry. \nto The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in \narbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in \ncourt. \nThis Arbitration Agreement represents \nstandard industry practice and binds you \nand UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS \nFinancial Services Incorporated of Puerto \nRico to arbitrate any &agreements that \nmay arise between the parties. \n\"The parties' for purposes of this \narbitration agreement, are LOBS Financial \nServices Inc. or UBS Financial Services \nIncorporated of Puerto Rico and you, \ninducting on behalf of your heirs, \nexecutors, administrators and assigns. \nUBS \nClient \nRelationship \nAgreement \n31 \nEFTA00024341\n\nUBS \nClient \nRelationship \nAgreement \nco The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments \nto them, shall be incorporated into this Agreement. \nBy opening an account at UBS, and by UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services \nIncorporated of Puerto Rico by accepting your application and carrying your Account, you, UBS \nFinancial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Service Incorporated of Puerto Rico agree as follows: \n00 To resolve any controversy, claim or issue in any controversy that may arise between \nyou and UBS Financial Services or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico \nby arbitration, whether it happened before or after, or at the time this Agreement \nwas executed, including but not limited to controversies, claims or issues in any \ncontroversy concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, \nperformance or breach of this Agreement or any other agreement. \nco Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration \nAct and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial \nIndustry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange's \narbitration forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services \nIncorporated of Puerto Rico is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with you, \nincluding, where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. \nco Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the \npanel. \nThe arbitrators shall resolve any controversy in accordance with applicable law. \nThe arbitrators will apply state and federal statutes of limitation the same as if the \nclaim were brought as a civil action in court. \nThe award of the arbitration panel is not subject to appeal and judgment upon the \naward may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. \nco \nNo person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to \nenforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated \nin court a putative dass action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not \nopted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class \naction until: \n— the class certification is denied; or \n— the class is decertified; or \nthe customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance \nto enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any \nrights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein. \nYou expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served \nby certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS. \nYou expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above. \nSIOUDIfl \n9091. \n£0Z \n5500 \naP \n32 \nEFTA00024342\n\nTrust Signature Page \nFor \nYour \nRecord' \n2 \nMI trustees must sign this document. \n8y signing below, I acknowledge that I understand and agree with the terms and conditions of the UBS Client Relationship Agreement, the Agreements \nand Disclosures booklet and addendum, and if applicable, the Agreements and Disclosures for IRAs, and the Retirement Plan Disclosures available at \nwww.ubscomketirementplandisclocures that is enclosed or that I have previously received.
