The\n-\nwas put on the priority list back in September but the team is \nunfortunately now back to getting the answer from PAE/database managers that there are only 2 priority cases that is \ntaking up all of the PAE resources, Epstein and 377 Union Street. ThEteam sent search warrant returns to PAE on \n9/22 and followed up yesterday to see if there was any ETA on getting them loaded and were told no. I completely \nunderstand that not all jobs can be a rush job but am hopeful that we can find a way for some of the PAE bandwidth to be \nreserved to load data in the normal course. If there could be a set expectation in terms of a  timeline by which PAE is \nexpected to load data in the normal course, I think that would be helpful guidance for us to provide to our unit so they \ncan plan accordingly. \nHappy to discuss. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 11, 2020 1:47 PM \nSubject: Fwd: PAE and Litigation priorities \nAnother \nSent from my iPad \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom \nDa \nTo \nSubject: Re: PAE and Litigation priorities \nYes, of course. \nOn Aug 28, 2020, at 10:02 AM, wrote: \nan we chat on Monday.

Currently 377 Union is the priority PAE is working on due to a proposed September production date set by the \nAUSA.
