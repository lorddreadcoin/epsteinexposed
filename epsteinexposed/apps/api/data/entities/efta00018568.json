I'm going to copy the file locally and try a few things. \nI \nwill keep you updated on my progress. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Friday, August 7, 2020 11:05 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter \nI'm still having the issue. The appendix (the last 30 pages or so) is searchable, but the report (the first 370+ pages) isn't. \nSo, for example, if you CTRL+F \"Epstein\" the first hit I get is on page 384, even though he is repeatedly referred to in the \nfirst 370+ pages. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Friday, August 7, 2020 11:02 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter \nWhat is the exact issue you were facing? The searches that I am conducting in the document are happening without issue. \nCopying the file over to the new location may have solved the issue. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Friday, August 7, 2020 10:57 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter \nShould now be here: \nThanks \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Friday, August 7, 2020 10:45 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter \nI believe just the drive. \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Friday, August 7, 2020 10:44 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: RE: OPR Matter \nGreat, thanks.

The attached report is not searchable for \nwhatever reason (the short appendix at the end is, but the first 380+ page report is not). Do you know/are you able to \nresave or convert this in some manner that would make it searchable?
