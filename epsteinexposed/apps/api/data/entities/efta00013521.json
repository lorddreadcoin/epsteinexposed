    "text": "\n\nFrom\nTo: \"Jay Lefkowitz\" \nBcc: ' \nUSAFLS)\" \nSubject: RE: Epstein \nDate: Wed, 31 Oct 2007 15:51:29 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \nJay, \nRegarding your statement that \"we are beginning to think about what discovery we may need to take to \nverify any claims\", I  remind you that paragraph 8 of the agreement states that Epstein \"waives his right to \ncontest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up to an amount as agreed to between the identified \nindividual and Epstein, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed exclusively under 18 USC s 2255 \nand agrees to waive any other claim for damages ... .\" That being said, you are correct in assuming that we do \nnot want to be copied on anything related to discovery. Monitoring the status of the negotiations/litigation by this \nOffice is limited to insuring that the terms and conditions of the Non-Prosecution Agreement are not breached. \nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz [mailto: \nSe October 30. 2007 4:54 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USAFLS) \nSubject: Re: Epstein \nThanks. \nI haven't heard anything from Judge Davis. I  assume he is still willing to take on the role you asked him to take on, but can you please \nlet me know if that is not the case? \nAlso, we are beginning to think about what discovery we may need to take to verify any claims. I am assuming that your office does \nnot want to be copied on any subpoenas or anything related to discovery. But please let me know if that is an incorrect assumption. \nThanks - Jay \nOriginal Message \nFrom: \nSent: 10/30/2007 02:42 PM AST \nTo: Jay Lefkowitz \nCc: ' (USAFLS)\" \nSubject: Epstein \nJay, \n> \nHere is an executed version of the addendum.
