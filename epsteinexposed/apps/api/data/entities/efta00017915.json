On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL \nand MICHAEL \nTHOMAS, the \ndefendants, in dereliction of their duties as \ncorrectional officers at  the Metropolitan Correctional Center \n(\"MCC\"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated \ncounts of prisoners \nunder their watch in  the MCC's Special Housing Unit \n(\"SHU\"). \nInstead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS \nsat at their desk, \nbrowsed the internet, and moved around the \ncommon area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their \nduties, NOEL and \nTHOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications \nattesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in \ntruth and in \nfact, they never conducted such counts. As a result \nof those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the \nSHU \nwere being regularly \nmonitored'and accounted for when in fact, as \na  result of  the defendants' conduct, \nno  correctional officer \nconducted any \ncount or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 \n1 \nEFTA00017915\n\np.m. \non \nAugust \n9 \nuntil \napproximately \n6:30 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10, \nat \nwhich \ntime, \nas \nalleged \nherein, \nNOEL \nand \nTHOMAS \ndiscovered \nthe \nbody \nof  \nan \nMCC \ninmate, \nJeffrey \nEpstein, \nwho \nhad \ncommitted \nsuicide \novernight \nwhile \nunobserved. \nRELEVANT \nINDIVIDUALS \nAND \nENTITIES \n2. \nThe \nMCC \nis \na  \nfederal \nadministrative \ndetention \nfacility \nlocated \nin \nManhattan \nthat \nis \nrun \nby \nthe \nFederal \nBureau \nof \nPrisons \n(\"BOP\")\n. \nThe \nMCC \nis \none \nof \nseveral \nfacilities \nused \nto \nhouse \ninmates \nwho \nhave \nbeen \ncharged \nwith \nfederal \ncrimes \nin  \nthe \nSouthern \nDistrict \nof  \nNew \nYork \nand \nare \nawaiting \ntrial. \nThe \nMCC \nemploys \ncorrectional \nofficers, \nwhose \nprimary \nduty \nis \nto \nensure \nthe \ncare, \ncustody, \nand \ncontrol \nof \nthe \ninmate \npopulation \nof \nthe \nMCC. \n3. \nTOVA \nNOEL, \nthe \ndefendant, \nhas \nbeen \nemployed \nas \na \ncorrectional \nofficer \nat \nthe \nMCC \nsince \napproximately \n2016. \nAs \nof \nAugust \n2019, \nNOEL's \nprimary \nassignment \nwas \nthe \nSHU. \nOn \nAugust \n9, \n2019, \nNOEL \nworked \na \nregular \nshift \nfrom \n4  \np.m. \nto \n12 \na.m. \nin \nthe \nSHU, \nand \nthen \nworked \nan \novertime \nshift \nfrom \n12 \na.m. \nto \n8 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10, \n2019, \nalso \nin \nthe \nSHU. \nNOEL \nhad \nalso \nworked \na \nregular \nshift \nin \nthe \nSHU \nthe \nday \nbefore, \nAugust \n8, \n2019, \nfrom \n12 \np.m. \nto \n8 \np.m. \n4. \nMICHAEL \nTHOMAS, \nthe \ndefendant, \nhas \nbeen \nemployed \nas \na  \ncorrectional \nofficer \nat \nthe \nMCC \nsince \napproximately \n2007. \nBeginning \nin \napproximately \n2013, \nTHOMAS \nwas \nassigned \nto \nwork \nas \na \n2 \nEFTA00017916\n\nmaterials \nhandler \nsupervisor, \nalthough \nTHOMAS \nregularly \nworked \novertime \nshifts \nas \na \ncorrectional \nofficer, \nincluding \nin \nthe \nSHU. \nTHOMAS \nworked \nan \novertime \nshift \nin \nthe \nSHU \non \nAugust \n10, \n2019, \nfrom \n12 \na.m. \nto \n8 \na.m. \nTHOMAS \ndid \nnot \nwork \nhis \nregular \nshift \non \nAugust \n8 \nor \nAugust \n9, \n2019, \nbut \ndid \nwork \nan \novertime \nshift \nin \nthe \nSHU \non \nAugust \n9, \n2019 \nfrom \n12 \na.m. \nto \n8 \na.m. \n5. \nAs \ndetailed \nherein, \nJeffrey \nEpstein \nwas \nincarcerated \nat \nthe \nMCC \nbetween \nhis \narrest \non  \nJuly \n6, \n2019, \nand \nhis \nsuicide \non  \nAugust \n10, \n2019. \nEpstein \nwas \ndetained \npending \ntrial \nin  \nthe \nSouthern \nDistrict \nof  \nNew \nYork \non  \nsex \ntrafficking \ncharges. \nTHE \nMCC \nAND \nINSTITUTIONAL \nCOUNTS \n6. \nThe \nMCC, \nwhich \nhouses \napproximately \n750 \ninmates \nat \nany \ngiven \ntime, \nassigns \ninmates \nto \nvarious \nhousing \nunits \nwithin \nthe \nMCC. \nThe \nSHU \nis \na \nhousing \nunit \nwithin \nthe \nMCC \nwhere \ninmates \nare \nsecurely \nseparated \nfrom \nthe \ngeneral \ninmate \npopulation \nto \nensure \ntheir \nown \nsafety \nas \nwell \nas \nthe \nsafety \nof \nstaff \nand \nother \ninmates. \nThe \nSHU \nis \nlocated \non \nthe \nninth \nfloor \nof \nthe \nMCC, \nand \naccess \nto \nthat \nfloor \nis  \ncontrolled \nby \na  \nlocked \ndoor \nthat \ncan \nbe  \nopened \nremotely \nonly \nby \nan \nofficer \nin \nthe \nMCC's \ncentralized \ncontrol \ncenter \n(the \n\"Control \nCenter\"), \nwhich \nis \nlocated \non \nthe \nfirst \nfloor \nof \nthe \nMCC. \nAccess \ninto \nthe \nSHU \nis \nalso \ncontrolled \nby \na \nsecond \nlocked \ndoor \nto \nwhich \nonly \ncorrectional \nofficers \nassigned \nto \nthe \nSHU \nhave \n3 \nEFTA00017917\n\nkeys while on duty. Within \nthe SHU, inmates are assigned to six \nseparate \ntiers, each of which \ncan \nbe accessed \nonly via \na \nsingle \nlocked door to which the correctional officers \nassigned to the SHU \nhave keys while on duty. \nEach tier has eight cells, each of which \ncan house either one or \ntwo prisoners, and each individual cell \nwhich is made of cement and metal - is \naccessed only through a \nsingle locked \ndoor, to which only correctional officers assigned \nto the SHU have keys while on duty. \n7. The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to \nguard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide \ncounts of \ninmates at \nregular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate \nis  alive and \naccounted for within the MCC (the \n\"institutional \ncount\").  On weekdays, the MCC conducts \nfive institutional counts \nat 4 \np.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 \na.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an \ninstitutional \ncount is one of the most basic and essential \naspects \nof a \ncorrectional officer's job, and the count is \none of the most \nbasic \nand essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. \nTwo \nofficers are required to \nperform the institutional count for each \nhousing unit, including the SHU, and are \nfurther required to \ndocument their \nperformance of the count on an official MCC \nform \ncalled a count slip. To perform the institutional \ncount in the \nSHU, two officers must \nwalk from tier to tier to observe and count \neach \nindividual inmate. \n4 \nEFTA00017918\n\n8. On the \ncount slip, both \ncorrectional officers \nare \nrequired to \nfill in the date and \ntime the count \nwas performed, \nwrite the \ntotal number of \ninmates physically present in \nthe unit \ncounted, and \nthen \nsign \nthe count slip. \nOnce the correctional \nofficers have completed \nand signed the count \nslips, the count \nslips ' \nare then \ncollected and \ndelivered to  the \nControl Center, where \nofficers within the \nControl Center are \nresponsible for comparing \nthe \ncount slips from each \nhousing unit to the \ninstitution's \ninmate \nroster to ensure \nthat each inmate is \naccounted for. \nOnly after \nall the count \nslips are \ncollected from each \nhousing unit, and \nthe \nnumbers on  the \nslips are matched to \nthe institution's \ninmate \nroster, can the \ninstitutional count \nbe deemed \"cleared\" or \ncompleted. If a  housing \nunit's count slip is \nincorrect or \nincomplete, then the \ninstitution cannot \n\"clear\" the \ncount. \nInstead, the count \nmust be \ncompletely redone in that \nhousing unit \nvia a more\n-intensive version of \nthe \ninstitutional count called a \n\"bed book \ncount,\" in which officers \nmust compare every \nindividual \ninmate to the \ninstitution's inmate \nroster. Records of  each \ninstitutional count, including \nthe count slips, are \nprovided to a \nsupervising \nofficial and retained by the \nMCC. \n9. In \naddition to  the \ninstitutional \ncount, the BOP \nrequires \ncorrectional officers assigned \nto the SHU to walk \neach of \nthe tiers of \nthe SHU - which \nis called a \n\"round\" - every \nthirty \n5 \nEFTA00017919\n\nminutes (\"30\n-minute rounds\"). Like the institutional counts, \ncorrectional \nofficers conduct 30\n-minute rounds to ensure that each \ninmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. Correctional \nofficers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which \nis reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date \nand time of each 30-minute \nround in each tier of the SHU. \nEPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT \n10. On July 6, 2019, \ninmate Jeffrey Epstein was \narrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On \nJuly 10, 2019, Epstein was \nassigned to the SHU due to, among other \nthings, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating \nto housing him with the MCC's general population. \n11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the \nSHU, MCC \nofficers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein \non the floor of his cell with a \nstrip of bedsheet around his neck. \nMICHAEL THOMAS, the \ndefendant, was one of the MCC officers who \nresponded to the incident. Epstein was \nsubsequently transferred \nout of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. Inmates placed \non suicide watch are housed \nin a cell on the hospital wing floor \nof the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff \nmember or a specially trained inmate \ncompanion. \n12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately \ntwenty-four hours, \nand then was transferred to psychological \n6 \nEFTA00017920\n\nobservation, \nuntil \nJuly \n30, \n2019. \nPsychological \nobservation \nis \nless \nrestrictive \nthan \nsuicide \nwatch, \nbut \ninmates \nare \nstill \nhoused \nin \nthe \nhospital \nwing \nof \nthe \nMCC \nand \nwatched \ntwenty-four \nhours \na \nday. \n13. \nOn \nJuly \n30, \n2019, \nEpstein \nwas \ntransferred \nback \nto \nthe \nSHU, \nand, \nat \nthe \ndirection \nof \nthe \nMCC's \npsychological \nstaff, \nwas \nrequired \nto  \nhave \nan  \nassigned \ncellmate. \nEpstein \nwas \nalso \nassigned \nto \nthe \ncell \nclosest \nto \nthe \ncorrectional \nofficers' \ndesk \nin \nthe \ncommon \narea \nof \nthe \nSHU, \nwhich \nwas \napproximately \nfifteen \nfeet \nfrom \nthe \ncell. \nConducting \nthe, \nrequired \ninstitutional \ncounts \nand \nthirty\n-minute \nrounds \nin \nthe \nSHU \nwere \nalso \npart \nof  \nthe \nMCC's \nprocedures \nfor \nensuring \nthe \nsafety \nof \ninmates, \nincluding \nEpstein. \nEVENTS \nOF \nAUGUST \n9-10, \n2019 \n14. \nOn \nAugust \n9, \n2019, \nEpstein's \ncellmate \nwas \ntransferred \nout \nof \nthe \nMCC \nin \na \nroutine, \npre\n-arranged \ntransfer \nat \napproximately \n8  \na.m. \nDespite \nthe \nMCC's \npsychological \nstaff's \ndirection \nthat \nEpstein \nhave \na  \ncellmate, \nno \nnew \ncellmati \nwas \nassigned \nto \nEpstein's \ncell. \n15. \nTOVA \nNOEL, \nthe \ndefendant, \nwas \none \nof \nthe \nassigned \nofficers \non \nduty \nin \nthe \nSHU \nfrom \n4 \np.m. \non \nAugust \n9, \n2019 \nto \n8 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10. \nFrom \n4  \np.m. \nto \n12 \na.m., \ntwo \nother \nofficers \nwere \non  \nduty \nwith \nNOEL \nin \nthe \nSHU: \none \nofficer \nwas \nassigned \nto \nwork \nfrom \n2 \np.m. \nto \n10 \np.m. \n(\"Officer\n-1\"), \nand \none \nofficer \nwas \n7 \nEFTA00017921\n\nassigned \nto \nwork \nfrom \n4 \np.m. \nto \n12 \na.m. \n(\"Officer\n-2\")\n.  \nMICHAEL \nTHOMAS, \nthe \ndefendant, \nstarted \nhis \nshift \nin \nthe \nSHU \nat \n12 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10. \nFrom \n12 \na.m. \nuntil \n8 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10, \nNOEL \nand \nTHOMAS \nwere \nthe \nonly \ntwo \nofficers \non \nduty \nin \nthe \nSHU. \n16. \nDuring \nthe \ntime \nperiod \nfrom \n4 \np.m. \non \nAugust \n9 \nto \n8 \na.m. \non \nAugust \n10, \nthe \nofficers \non \nduty \nin \nthe \nSHU, \nincluding \nTOVA \nNOEL \nand \nMICHAEL \nTHOMAS, \nthe \ndefendants, \nwere \nresponsible \nfor \nconducting \nfive \ninstitutional \ncounts: \n4 \np.m. \nand \n10 \np.m. \non \nAugust \n9;

Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., \nand at approximately 12  a.m.,  MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, \nreplaced Officer-2, \njoining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only \ntwo correctional officers on duty in the SHU. NOEL and THOMAS \nwere responsible for \nconducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in \nthe SHU. As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video \nsurveillance system, \nNOEL and \nTHOMAS did not \nperform the 12 \na.m. \ncount. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count \nslip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely \nstated that the \ninstitutional count \nhad been performed. In  reliance on  that \nfalsified \ncount slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control \nCenter cleared the 12 a.m. count. \n22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL \nTHOMAS, the defendants, were \nadditionally responsible for conducting \nthe 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. \ninstitutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the \nMCC's internal video surveillance \nsystem, NOEL and THOMAS did not \nperform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL \nand THOMAS \nnonetheless completed and \nsigned count slips for both counts that \nfalsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. \ninstitutional \ncounts.

At \napproximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional \nofficer briefly \nwalked through the SHU common area. \nAside from \nthose two \nofficers, as confirmed by \nvideo surveillance, \nno  one \nelse entered the SHU, no \none conducted any counts or \nrounds \nthroughout the night, \nand no one entered the tier in which Epstein \nwas \nhoused. \n26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL \nTHOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, \nreceived a  delivery of \nbreakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were \nagain the \nonly officers in the SHU. Shortly after \n6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS \nwalked up to and entered the \ntier in which Epstein was housed to \nserve breakfast. \nAt approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm \nwas \nactivated in  the SHU. Epstein was \nalone in  his cell and not \nresponsive, with a noose \naround his neck.
