The other victim attorneys have been attending the \nconferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 6:00 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \nThank you very much for this information. I plan to attend this court this status conference on Wednesday. I am \nconcerned that the courtroom may be full and no seat will be available for me . Would you be kind enough to have \nsomeone on your staff save a seat for me? Also, since the courthouse is very close to your office I have emailed to \nask if she would be willing to meet at your office instead of at my hotel at 1P.M.Since her hotel is near to your office and \nnear the courthouse and since I will be in the area now as well , if she feels comfortable meeting at your office instead of \nmy hotel I am willing to meet at your office to save you and her the time to travel to my hotel. I will let you know when \nshe responds. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 1:50 PM \nEFTA00021398\n\nTo: \nSubject: RE: Wednesday \nHi \nYes—in this district, criminal defendants are present at all court conferences absent unusual circumstances. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2019 4:46 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Wednesday \nI see that a  status conference is scheduled for Mr. Epstein 's criminal case in court in New York at 11A.M.on Wednesday \n,July 31.
