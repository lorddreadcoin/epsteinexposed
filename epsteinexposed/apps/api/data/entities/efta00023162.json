And just as a heads up, not that I particularly expect this will \nbe necessary, but similar to how we always tell witnesses that if they want to talk with their counsel privately during an in-\nperson meeting, we'll let her know that the same thing holds true for over the phone as well, that you two can always \nhave a side call at any point! And otherwise I think it will be the usual awkwardness of phone but hopefully not too bad. \nthanks again, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 08, 2020 14:46 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: follow-up request \nEFTA00023162\n\nIf that does not work she also said she could do it this Monday morning — 10:00 Eastern (9:00 if that is better for \nyour team. \nJust let me know. \nThanks \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nwww.bsfllp.com\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 8, 2020 1:59 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: follow-up request \n) \n[mailto: \n> \nCAUTION: External email.

As \nI'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, \nwhich also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might \nbe willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to \ndo it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any \nquestions at all.
