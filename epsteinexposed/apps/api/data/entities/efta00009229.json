Mr. Acosta, \nI'm \n19 \nI am a counsel \nwith the Office of \nProfessional \n20 \nResponsibility here at the \nDepartment of Justice, and with \nme \n21 \nare my fellow \nOPR counsel, \nand \nIIII \n22 \n.  We \nare in a conference room at \nthe Department of \n23 Justice main \nbuilding on today, October 18, \n2019, and we're \n24 \nstarting at about \n9:30 in the morning. Before we \nstart, I'd \n25 \njust \nwant to put on the record \nthat Mr. worked in \nEFTA00009231\n\nPage 4 \n1 the \nCivil Rights Division at the time \nthat you were the AAG \n2 \nheading that division, and \nI \nbelieve had an \noccasion to \n3 \nbriefly meet you in connection \nwith a matter. \n4 \nTHE WITNESS: \nCould I ask what section? \n5 \nMR. \nI was in the \nspecial litigation \n6 \nsection. \n7 \nTHE WITNESS: \nOh, okay. \n8 \nMR. \n:  And I provided \nMr. Acosta some \n9 talking points for a \npress situation that we had in \nthat \n10 \ncase. \n11 \nTHE WITNESS: 14141. \n12 \nMR. :  Yes. \n13 \nTHE WITNESS: Probably. \n14 BY \nMS. \n15 \nQ All right. Thank \nyou. Mr. Acosta, OPR is \n16 \ninvestigating two things. As you \nknow, one, whether one or \n17 more federal prosecutors in \nthe Southern District of Florida \n18 \nU.S. Attorney's Office may \nhave committed professional \n19 \nmisconduct by entering into the non\n-prosecution agreement, or \n20 NPA, in 2007 with \nJeffrey Epstein, who at the \ntime was under \n21 investigation by that \noffice, and the FBI, for engaging in \n22 widespread sexual \nmisconduct involving underage \nfemales. \n23 \nThe \nsecond thing we're investigating is Judge \n24 \nMarra's finding of February of \nthis year, 2019, that the \n25 government may have \nviolated -- or, actually, he found the \nEFTA00009232\n\nPage \n5 \n1 government did violate the \nCVRA, or Crime Victims' Rights Act \n2 when it entered into the \nMPA without first providing the \n3 victims with \nnotice and a reasonable right to \nconfer with the \n4 \ngovernment. \n5 \nYou are a \nsubject of the OPR investigation, that \n6 is, one of -- somebody \nwhose conduct is being reviewed and \n7 \nevaluated \nby OPR, and specifically as U.S. Attorney \nat the \n8 \ntime for the \nSouthern District of Florida, you had the \n9 ultimate authority over the Epstein for \na period of two and a \n10 half years, as \nwe understand it, from the time the \nline AUSA \n11 \nfirst \nbriefed you and then criminal \nchief \n12 \nin July of 2006, and until you were \nformally \n13 \nrecused from the case on or about the 8th of \nDecember, 2008, \n14 after \nnotifying the executive office of the U.S. Attorneys \n15 that you were \nseeking employment with Kirkland S Ellis, a \n16 \nfirm of which two attorneys, Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz \nhad \n17 been \nrepresenting Jeffrey Epstein. Is \nthat correct? \n18 A We may -- we may get into it a \nlittle bit later, \n19 but I think the characterization of my \nseeking employment is \n20 not accurate, we can talk about that a little \nbit later. \n21 \nQ All \nright. We have the documents that relate to \n22 that. So, \nthat's what we're -- we're basing it on. \n23 \nA \nCorrect. \n24 \nQ \nAnd I \nbelieve the term that's used is seeking \n25 \nemployment. \nEFTA00009233\n\nPage 6 \n1 A \nThat -- that is the term used in the \ne-mail. I \n2 think I addressed \nthat in my -- I believe Mr. Todd \naddressed \n3 that in \nthe letter that was sent \nto --\n4 \n5 \n6 \nQ All right. \nA -- OPR. \nQ All \nright. Thank you. So, we recognize \nthat \n7 you're not \nlonger with the Department of \nJustice --\n8 A \nRight. \n9 \nQ \n-- and that it is \nyour choice to come and talk to \n10 us, and we \nvery much appreciate your willingness \nto \n11 voluntarily do so \nand help us figure this \ncase out. OPR \n12 provided you \nwith a few thousand pages \nof records, e-mails, \n13 \nand correspondence and some other \ndocuments that reflect your \n14 \ninvolvement in the Epstein matter over that two \nand a half \n15 \nyear \nperiod. \n16 \nNow that you've had a chance to \nreview, I hope, \n17 \nthose e-mails and other \ndocuments, we hope you can be \n18 \nspecific in helping us understand what \nhappened. Have you in \n19 fact \nbeen able to review those documents? \n20 A \nYes, I \nhave. \n21 \nQ \nThank you. \nOPR asked you for a written response to \n22 certain \nquestions, and we've received and reviewed a \nwritten \n23 response prepared \nand submitted not by you, but by \nyour \n24 \nattorney, Mr. Todd, on your behalf. \nHave you reviewed his \n25 \nresponse \nto --\nEFTA00009234\n\nPage \n7 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \nA Yes. \nQ \n-- you? \nA Yes, I \nhave. \nQ And will you now under \noath subscribe to that \n5 \nresponse as if you had \nsubmitted to it yourself? \n6 \nA So, Mr. Todd spoke to me and conveyed the \n7 investigation that I provide \nhim. I believe he conveyed that \n8 \ninformation accurately, and the statements that \nhe ascribes \n9 to me in that letter I \nbelieve are accurate. \n10 Q \nAll right. Do you \nhave any changes or corrections \n11 \nto that \nwritten response? \n12 \nA No, I do not. \n13 Q \nIs there anything in it that \nyou do not agree with? \n14 \nA Again, I think that the \nstatements that he ascribes \n15 to me are accurate, and I agree \nwith them. \n16 \nQ \nAll right. So, we are going to \naccept that \n17 statement as representing \naccurately your -- what you would \n18 \nhave responded if you had responded to \nus directly. Is that \n19 \ncorrect? \n20 \nA I -- yes, the statements, he \nbasically gives my \n21 positions, and \nI believe that he gave my positions \n22 accurately. \n23 \nQ \nPerfect. Thank you. So, as we ask questions \nand \n24 refer to documents, we would \nlike you to correct any \n25 misstatements \nin our questions, or any misstatements or \nEFTA00009235\n\nPage 8 \n1 \nerrors that are in the documents \nthemselves, because we want \n2 \nto make sure the entire record --\n3 \nA \nMm-hmm. \n4 \nQ -- is \ncorrect. Also, there's been an enormous \n5 amount of \npublicity about the Epstein case, particularly \nthis \n6 \nyear, including about the events and \ndecisions made back in \n7 2006 to 2010 that are the subject of \nour investigation. And \n8 \nso as best you can, we ask you to try \nto answer today from \n9 your \nknowledge, understanding, and recollections as of \nthat \n10 \nperiod of time. However, to the \nextent you are asked or do \n11 \nspeak retroactively, retrospectively, we'll \njust make it \n12 \nclear \nthat you're doing so. \n13 \nA \nAll right. \n14 \nQ \nOkay? \n15 A And if I \ncould just say, one of the difficulties is \n16 with \neverything that -- all the publicity and all the \n17 \ndocuments that have made it to the press and in litigation \n18 distinguishing between \nrecollection versus after the fact \n19 Q \nRight. \n20 \nA -- speculation, and I will try, but I would \n21 \nappreciate reminders along the way, because it's, it's \nan \n22 important distinction, but it's kind of hard \nsometimes. \n23 Q \nwe recognize particularly the \nimportance of it. \n24 \nA \nRight. \n25 \nQ \nThat's -- that's \nprecisely the heart of --\nEFTA00009236\n\nPage 9 \n1 \nA Yeah. \n2 Q \n-- our matter. So, \nMr. Acosta, your \nprofessional \n3 background is a \nmatter of public record. I have \na couple of \n4 \nquestions. By what state bar are \nyou currently licensed? \n5 A \nSo, I am inactive in \nI \nbelieve inactive in \n6 \nPennsylvania and \nalso in \nD.C. \n7 \n8 \n9 \nQ All \nright, and not in \nFlorida? \nA Not \nin Florida. \nQ So, are -- is it -- do \nI understand that you are \n10 \nnot currently an active member of any bar? \n11 \nA \nI \nwould have to confirm with \nD.C. I said not \n12 \ninactive in Pennsylvania and in D.C. \nbecause I am not certain \n13 \nwhether I'm currently active or inactive in D.C. I \nam not \n14 \ncurrently practicing, and so I would have renewed \nunder \n15 \neither active or \ninactive. \n16 Q \nAll right. \n17 \nA And we \ncan --\n18 \nQ \nwe --\n19 \nA We can --\n20 Q \nWe --\n21 A We can verify that \nand get that. \n22 \nQ We would \nappreciate it if Mr. Todd could let us \n23 know your current \nstatus. I also would like to know the \n24 status -- your bar status in the \nperiod of 2006 through 2008. \n25 \nDo you know \nwhat that was? \nEFTA00009237\n\nPage 10 \n1 \nA Most likely -- I \ncan -- I can speculate. I don't \n2 \nknow as a fact. Mostly likely \nactive in D.C. \n3 \nQ Mm-hmm. \n4 \nA And \ninactive in Pennsylvania. \n5 \nQ Okay, but likely active somewhere, \ncorrect? \n6 \nA Yes. Yes, I think \nthat's a requirement. \n7 Q \nYes, \nthat is a --\n8 \nA And so --\n9 \nQ \n-- requirement. \n10 A So, it would \nbe D.C., the distinction between \n11 \nactive and inactive in D.C. is \nmore minor, as I recall, than \n12 Pennsylvania where there's a \nlarge fee difference. \n13 \nQ All right, thank you, and we \nlook forward to \n14 hearing confirmation of that from you, \nMr. Todd. So, after \n15 \nserving nearly two years as the \nassistant attorney general in \n16 charge of the department's civil \nrights division, you were \n17 presidentially \nappointed the interim U.S. Attorney for the \n18 Southern District of Florida in \nJune of 2005, and then as we \n19 understand it, you were formally \nnominated as U.S. Attorney \n20 in June of 2006, and after being confirmed \nby the United \n21 States Senate, you \nwere sworn in by the U.S. Attorney -- as \n22 U.S. \nAttorney in late October 2006. \n23 A I think that may be inaccurate. \nI would have to \n24 confirm. \nWhen you say presidentially appointed, I \nbelieve it \n25 may have been appointed by the \nchief judge at the request of \nEFTA00009238\n\nPage \n11 \n1 the \nAttorney General. The chief judge has \nappointing \n2 authority. \n3 \nQ \nOkay. \n4 A \nAnd you'd have to go \nback and confirm whether it \n5 was either an AG \ndesignation or the chief judge --\n6 \nQ All right. \n7 \nA -- which is different than \npresidential. \n8 \nQ \nAnd I understand, and again, I would \nappreciate if \n9 \nyou could --\n10 \nA Yeah. \n11 \nQ -- \nfollow up on that --\n12 \nA \nI -- I'm --\n13 \nQ \n-- Mr. \nTodd. \n14 A \n-- not certain how to confirm that. \nThat's \n15 \nsomething that in all candor the department would know --\n16 \nQ All right. \n17 \nA \n-- much \nbetter than I. \n18 Q \nThen we will pursue it. My point is that there was \n19 a change in \nyour status from interim to -- you -- the \nU.S. \n20 \nAttorney with the -- with the full --\n21 \nA \nCorrect. \n22 \nQ -- \nconfirmation. How if at all did that change in \n23 status affect your view \nof and your exercise of your \n24 authority as U.S. Attorney? \n25 A So, it's difficult to recall. You're now \nasking \nEFTA00009239\n\nPage 12 \n1 that just ten \nyears back, but even further back. I was \n2 interim for a \nsufficiently long period of time that -- that \n3 by the time the change \nin status took place, I would \n4 speculate that I was, in my mind, \nthe, you know, acting as \n5 U.S. Attorney \nwhether you have an adjunctive interim, or \n6 acting in front of your name or \nnot. \n7 \nYou \nknow, I -- I had great \npeople. I don't recall \n8 \nwhen -- when came on board as first assistant, \nbut he \n9 \nwas my crim chief, and I thought \nfor the continuity of the \n10 office \nit was important to promote him to \nfirst assistant, \n11 \nand --\nQ \nHe was \npromoted actually effective October of 2006. \n3 You made a series -- \naccording to e-mails -- the \n14 announcement -- the personnel \nannouncement was made to be \n15 effective in October 2006 \nnaming \n16 \nchief, and as \nfirst \n--\n17 \nA Right. \n18 \nQ -- assistant. \n19 A \nRight, and they -- they were both long serving \n20 \nprofessionals within the office, and basically, \nas my \n21 recollection, everyone just moved \nup one wrung. \n22 \nQ Okay. \nas criminal \n23 \nA You \nwould know better than I, because you have \n24 those records. And so, sitting \nhere today, I don't recall \n25 any specific way in which that shift would have impacted --\nEFTA00009240\n\nPage 13 \n1 \nQ All right. \n2 \nA -- my thinking. \n3 \nQ You had not \nserved as a -- as a prosecutor before, \n4 \nand had -- \ndidn't have direct criminal \nexperience is my \n5 \nunderstanding. \n6 \nA The -- that is \ncorrect. I had supervised -- civil \n7 rights, for example, had supervised criminal \nprosecutions, \n8 but I had not been a line \nprosecutor previously. \n9 \nQ So, as the U.S. Attorney \nsupervising a couple of \n10 \nhundred \n--\n11 \nA Right. \n12 \nQ -- line prosecutors, most involved in criminal \n13 work, how -- what -- \nwhat -- what interested you \nmost, or \n14 appealed to you most as \nyou undertook your -- and carried \nout \n15 \nyour duties as U.S. \nAttorney? \n16 \nA What interested me and appealed to \nme. So, the \n17 work of the office, I mean, the -- it's a \nbroad question, but \n18 the work of --\n19 \nQ )t-hmm. \n20 \nA -- that office and any U.S. Attorney's Office I \n21 think is incredibly impactful to \nany local community, and I \n22 very much enjoyed being a \npart of the effort to bring folks \n23 to justice, to move policy \ninitiatives. You know, I recall \n24 early on, we identified healthcare fraud \n25 \nQ \nHa-hmm. \nEFTA00009241\n\nPage 14 \n1 \nA -- as one big -- one big area, and we had one of \n2 the largest out of our -- the largest healthcare fraud \n3 \ninitiative. You know, we \nfocused quite a bit \non gun \n4 violence, and we did a great job on that, and it's one of \n5 those jobs where people feel very good about what they do, \n6 \nand it's great to be part of \nit. \nI'm sure what --\n7 \nQ \nNo, that's --\n8 \nA \n-- okay. \n9 \nQ That's helpful. It just gives us a \n10 \nA Yeah. \n11 \nQ -- some \nperspective. \n12 A Yeah. \n13 \nQ Was there \nany aspect of it that you particularly \n14 \ndisliked? \n15 \nA To the extent you're dealing with personnel issues, \n16 I think personnel issues are -- are rarely the preferred part \n17 \nof any executive function. \n18 \nQ You mean the conflicts among attorneys, things like \n19 \nthat, or performance issues? \n20 \nA Performance issues. \n21 \nQ All right. \n22 \nA And you \nknow, when you've got -- in \nany large \n23 \noffice, you get \npersonnel \nissues, \ndisciplinary \nissues, and \n24 \nthose are \nnever --\n25 Q \nMm-hmm. \nEFTA00009242\n\nPage \n15 \n1 \nA \n-- those are never \nfun. \n2 \nQ MM-hmm. So, we talked \nabout the personnel -- high \n3 \nlevel personnel \nchanges you made sort of after your first \n4 \nyear \nthere. I= had, we understand, been \nfunctioning \n5 de facto \nas a first assistant while IS \nwas not. \n6 He -- \nwe understand \nhad been first assistant, but \n7 \nhe stepped away, and ME \nNM came in to \nessentially take \n8 \nover his brief until he was \nformerly appointed first \n9 \nassistant. Is that consistent with your memory? \n10 A So, \nyou might have characterized that more \nstrongly \n11 \nthat I \nwould \nhave. \n12 \nQ Okay. \n13 A \nAgain, it's difficult to recreate \nfrom back then, \n14 but there was \ncertainly a transition period from Mr. \n15 \nto \nMr. \n, and if I could, because \nwhen you \n16 \nsaid high level changes, my intent -- \nit was a great office. \n17 \nGreat professionals. My intent in \nelevating Mr. was \n18 just you go \nfrom criminal chief to first \nassistant, and I \n19 don't \nrecall Mr. prior position, but I \nknow that he \n20 was also \nelevated. I think he might have been major \ncrimes, \n21 \nbut --\n22 \nQ That's \ncorrect. \n23 A -- I'd be -- I'd be \nspeculating. \n24 \nQ \nWe can --\n25 A I \ncould guess it. \nEFTA00009243\n\na \ne \n1\n1 \nQ We can verify that. \n2 \nA \nOkay. \n3 Q \nYes. What was your \nassessment of \nHis \n4 \ncapabilities, his judgement, and his working \nrelationship \n5 \nwith you on a day to day \nbasis? \n6 \nA Outstanding. He had been in the office for \n7 decades. He was respected by \neveryone. He had a good tone \n8 \nto him. He was someone, you know, I wanted \nindividuals \n9 around me that were \nrespected within the office and that were \n10 trusted and that had been there for a \nlong time, and then I \n11 think I was \nvery lucky to -- to have that \nin my management \n12 \nteam. \n13 Q \nAs we understand it, your office as U.S. Attorney \n14 was sort of on one side of the \nreception area, and the first \n5 assistant's office is \non the other side. Is that correct? \n_E \nA Thi,t Ls  _erred. \n17 \nQ Or, at the time --\n18 \nA Correm \n19 \nQ \n-- that was correct. So, did you and \n20 have a sort of easy back \nand forth --\n21 \nA Walking --\n22 \nQ \n-- open door? \n23 \nA -- into each other's offices multiple times a \n24 \nday --\n4 \nAll right. \nEFTA00009244\n\nPage \n17 \n1 \n2 \nA \n-- kind of \nrelationship. \nQ All right, and given \nthat he had had experience \n3 \nthroughout his career at the department in the criminal arena \n4 \nand you had not, to what extent would you rely \non him, among \n5 others, for guidance, perspective, information, \nand so on? \n6 A \nI named him first assistant because I valued his \n7 guidance and his perspectives and I thought \nthose were \n8 \nvaluable. \n9 \nQ Okay. You also, as we pointed out, \nappointed \n10 \nto \nsucceed \nas criminal chief effective \n11 October of 2006, \nand he served for about ten months \nbefore he \n12 \nleft for private practice. He left at the beginning of \n13 \nAugust \n--\n14 A Mm-hmm. \n15 \nQ -- \n2007. What -- you -- you did -- you said you \n16 didn't \nrecall, as we sit here today, what section he'd \ncome \n17 \nfrom. \n18 \nA Right. I guessed it was major crimes. \n19 \nQ \nAll right. Were you -- what was \nyour assessment of \n20 \n21 A \nOutstanding as well, and if I could say, when I say \n22 \nI don't recall but I guess, when you're going back 12 years, \n23 \nsometimes you get an impression but you can't say it's a \n24 recollection, and \nthat's going to come up multiple times \n25 today, just because it's a while ago. \nEFTA00009245\n\nPage 18 \n1 \nQ \nAs long as we make that \ndistinction --\n2 A Right. \n3 \nQ \n-- both are helpful. \n4 A \nRight, and so -- so, whether it's a \nrecollection or \n5 a construction \nafter the fact, I can't can't say, but \n6 you know, I -- I \nthought that one of the helpful factors with \n7 \nis he had spent a lot of time -- and major \ncrimes is the \n8 most active -- \nactive unit. I assume you all know the \n9 \nstructures of the office --\n10 \nQ \nMm-hmm. \n11 \nA -- \nbut major crimes is not major crimes, \nit's sort \n12 of the entry level crimes, and I valued the fact that he had \n13 \ntrained and, you know, so many AUSAs, and really spent a \nlot \n14 \nof time reviewing -- the major crimes chief as opposed to the \n15 \nother chiefs spends a lot of time reviewing the work of \n16 AUSAs, and so, he would be someone who is \nvery experienced \n17 and able to get in the weeds. \n18 Q \nAnd he in fact was around -- during that time \n19 period, \nhad gone back in the courtroom, if you recall, to \n20 actually try a major \ncase. Do you recall that? /t was a --\n21 \nA \nI didn't until \nyou --\n22 \nQ \n-- major \nfraud case. \n23 A \n-- \nmentioned -- I didn't \nuntil \nyou \nmentioned \nit, \n24 and now there's something in the back of \nmy head that's \n25 \nsaying that sounds right, but I can't give you more detail. \nEFTA00009246\n\nPage 19 \n1 \nQ All right. What was your assessment of \n2 \nsort of working style, and \nparticularly working \n3 \nwith you? \n4 A You know, again, positive. You know, we didn't --\n5 I didn't see him as often as Mr. , but --\n6 \n7 \nQ He -- was he located on the same floor? \nA He was located on the same floor, but not within \n8 the same suite. \n9 \nQ \nMM-hmm. \n10 A And -- and that -- that affects \ninteraction, but a \n11 positive working relationship. \n12 \nQ All right, and how how -- to what extent would \n13 you, as criminal chief, was he relied on by you as \n14 \ndistinguished from with regard to the criminal \n15 matters pending? \n16 A \nAlso relied on. \nDepend -- that would depend almost \n17 \non the matter \nfor --\n18 \nQ \nOkay. \n19 A -- as in a typical situation, he would bring things \n20 \nto \nwho would them bring them to me along, and so he \n21 would bring \nthings to , and then depending on \ntheir \n22 discussion, they might both walk into my office. But he \n23 would typically run things through before coming to me. \n24 Q \nWere there occasions when he would come to you \n25 \ndirectly? \nEFTA00009247\n\nPage \n20 \n1 \n2 \n3 \nA Sure. That's why I said in a typical --\nQ Okay. \nA It's difficult to sort \nof recreate the \n4 interactions, but \nhe certainly could come to me directly, and \n5 in some cases, I would say probably would. \n6 \nQ Again, it being a large office with several \n7 physical locations, and we understand \nit, a very high \n8 \nvolume --\n9 A Mm-hmm. \n10 \nQ -- of cases --\n11 \nA Right. \n12 Q \n-- and particularly in the \ncriminal context, is it \n13 fair to say you didn't review every prosecution as \nit was \n14 \nbrought? \n15 A It -- it \nis not just fair, but accurate. I recall \n16 \na conversation with a U.S. Attorney from a small district \n17 early on \nat one U.S. Attorney's conference where we compared \n18 notes, and the \ninteraction of an office with 30 prosecutors \n19 is very different than one with --\n20 \nQ \nHm-hmm. \n21 A \n-- a few hundred prosecutors. \n22 \nQ \nSo, when you did engage on a -- on a criminal case, \n23 \nwould you -- whether it was a planned prosecution or a \ncase \n24 \nheading to trial, \nwould you \ngenerally rely on \nwritten \n25 \nsubmissions, or would you -- this is really an --\nEFTA00009248\n\nPage 21 \n1 \nA \nMm-hmm. \n2 \nQ -- \ninquiry \ninto --\n3 A Right. \n4 Q \n-- your \nstyle, or would you have \neverybody \nS \ntogether, and talk about it, or \nwould you rely on your \nmost \n6 \nimmediate subordinates to \nbe briefing you? How -- which one \n7 \nof those --\nA \nSo --\n9 \nQ -- \nkinds of --\n10 \nA \nSo --\n11 Q \n-- \napproaches --\n12 A \nSo --\n13 \nQ \n-- did you take? \n14 \nA I \nwould say that really depended, and \nprobably \n15 varied based on \n-- on individual needs. \nFor the most part, I \n16 \nwould most likely just speak with \nmy first assistant and/or \n17 \ncriminal chief, and assess what \nelse needed to be done. \n18 Q \nIn other words, you would sort of do it \non a --\n19 sort of on a \nverbal, or based on oral --\n20 A Correct. \n21 Q \n-- interaction and --\n22 \nA Correct. \n23 Q \n-- presentation \nas opposed to going through \nstacks \n24 of \npapers? \n25 A \nFor -- for the -- I would say that was \ntypical. \nEFTA00009249\n\nPage 22 \n1 \nQ \nYeah. \n2 \nA \nI don't want to say that was the case \nevery single \n3 time, but that was -- was typical. \n4 \nQ \nAll right, and to what extent did you go out and \n5 about to encounter the line attorneys, or example? Was that \n6 something that you were able to do and \nwanted to do? \n7 \nA Yes, and yes, and you know, I -- when I started, I \n8 made it a point of walking every \nfloor and meeting everyone, \n9 \nand in -- toward the end of the day, I would also if I could \n10 make it a \npoint -- particularly of major crimes of just \n11 walking down to the floor and seeing \nwho was there and what \n12 they were doing and -- and sort of popping my head in and \n13 just \nsaying hi because I think it's the right thing to do. \n14 Q \nOkay. Okay. Was that a way to \nsupport the troops, \n15 or was it more a way for you to \nfind -- to become informed \n16 about what was \ngoing on? \n17 A \nProbably a little of both, of support the troops, \n18 but also \nget the temperature for the office, see how matters \n19 are \nprogressing. \n20 Q \nYou at the criminal -- or, rather, the civil rights \n21 division, \nhad experience with human trafficking and child sex \n22 trafficking cases --\n23 \nA Correct. \n24 Q \n-- under your supervision. We understand that you \n25 brought that concern, or your concern about those issues with \nEFTA00009250\n\nPage 23 \n1 you to the U.S. \nAttorney's Office, and that -- we know that \n2 under your tenure, \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office had many \n3 \nsuccessful prosecutions involving conduct ranging from \n4 internet child \npornography --\n5 A Mm-hmm. \n6 Q \n-- to international sex tourism --\n7 \nA \nCorrect. \n8 \nQ -- \nvictimizing children in particular. In mid-\n9 \n2007, you -- according to press \nreports, you set up a new \n10 special \nprosecutions unit \n--\n11 A Correct. \n12 \nQ -- to focus on, among other things, sex crimes \n13 \nagainst children. Could you tell us what \nimportance those \n14 \nkinds of cases held for you as U.S. Attorney? \n15 \nA Sure. If I could -- if I could \njust back up a \n16 little \nbit, because the -- the question goes -- the special \n17 \nprosecutions unit, and let \nme \naddress \nthat part of it. \nThere \n18 are a few things \nembedded in that. \n19 \nQ \nMM-hmm. \n20 A There's -- there's -- the \nspecial prosecutions unit \n21 was set up because there were some issues that -- that I \n22 thought were important to pursue in particular, and one of \n23 those was -- was sort of the trafficking issues. Another one \n24 was the gun violence, \nand the intent of special prosecutions \n25 was to have a group of individuals that \nwould sort of be \nEFTA00009251\n\nPage \n24 \n1 dedicated and \nnot part of the usual major \ncrimes group. So, \n2 it wasn't \nexclusively -- I -- your question may have \nimplied \n3 it was \nexclusively for sex crimes, \nand it --\n4 \nQ \nOh, no. \n5 A -- and it \nwasn't -- yeah. \n6 \nQ \nNo, I understand it was \nnot. \n7 \nA \nRight. \n8 \nQ Okay. \n9 \nA And so, I \nthought it was sufficiently important, \n10 and \nso, it was one of the -- one \nof the initiatives that we \n11 were \ncertainly pursuing. \n12 \nQ And was that something that you can -- \nthat -- to \n13 which you \nbrought your experience as head \nof the civil rights \n14 division \nas well? \n15 \nA It was. I think -- not I \nthink I know when I was \n16 head of civil rights \nthat that's something that I'd put \n17 \nparticular emphasis on, and I \nthought civil rights really \n18 stepped up and did a great job \non that. \n19 \nQ \nDid you yourself ever -- I \nrecognize you were never \n20 a \nprosecutor as such. \n21 \nA Right. \n22 \nQ But did \nyou ever have experience being involved in \n23 a prosecution that -- \nsort of the nitty-gritty of the \n24 \nprosecution of that kind of \ncase? Sort of seconding yourself \n25 to a trial team, \nfor example, or an investigation? \nEFTA00009252\n\nPage 25 \n1 \nA \nSo, if by nitty-gritty you mean \nseconding myself to \n2 a trial team \nthe answer would be no. \n3 Q \nAll right. \n4 \nA There are a number \nof cases that I recall \nbeing \n5 \nbriefed on and talking about, but --\n6 \n7 \nA \n8 \n9 \nprogram, \n10 A \n11 \n12 \nappointed \n13 A Correct. \n14 Q \n-- coordinator, and she was also of \ncourse the line \n15 \nattorney on the Epstein case. How well did \nyou know \n16 \n, and can you -- can you give \nus your assessment of \n17 her capabilities, \njudgement, and her interaction with you? \n18 \nA So, a few things in there. \nHow well did I know her \n19 prior to appointment? I don't \nrecall. I'm not -- I don't \n20 think I knew her particularly \nwell prior to appointment. She \n21 was clearly \nrespected within the office, and / \ndon't recall \n22 but \nI can speculate that she was appointed \nbased on \n23 \nrecommendations of management, and her interest \nand some \n24 combination -- \nand prior work and some combination \nthereof. \n25 \nYou asked me to \ncharacterize \n--\nBut \nat that high level? \nCorrect. \nAll \nright. The department set \nup in 2006 a PSC \na Project Safe \nChildhood program --\nCorrect. \n-- focused on internet child \npornography, and you \nas your first \nPSC --\nEFTA00009253\n\nPage 26 \n1 Q \nHer -- your view of \n2 \nA Right. \n3 \nQ -- \nher capabilities, her judgement \n4 A \nRight. \n5 \nQ her \nacumen, her knowledge of \nthe law. \n6 A \nI think she was a good, strong, \nprofessional AUSA. \n7 \nI \nmean \n--\n8 Q \nDo you \nhave any -- did you have any \nnegative -- you \n9 \nknow, anything less than fully \npositive in your assessment \nof \n10 \nher? \n11 A \nNo. \n12 \nQ \nOkay. \n13 A I think she was a good, \nstrong, dedicated AUSA. \n14 \nQ \nAll \nright. \n15 A \nYeah. \n16 Q \n-- was the managing AUSA at the \nWest Palm Beach \n17 office. \n18 \nA \nCorrect. \n19 \nQ At least -- and would -- and \nworked \n20 \nthere. How closely did you work with and \nagain, \n21 \nthat \n--\n22 A 24m-hmm. \n23 \n02 \n-- assessment question --\n24 \nA \nRight. \n25 \nQ \n-- what was your assessment of him? \nEFTA00009254\n\nPage 27 \n1 \nA \nSo, less so, only because \nof geographic distance. \n2 \nQ Mt-hmm. \n3 A \nI would also say he \nwas a respected professional. \n4 He had a good \nreputation. He went on to be chief of \nstaff \n5 \nhere at the -- at the criminal \ndivision, which I think speaks \n6 to how he \nwas viewed within the \ndepartment. \n7 \nQ \nmin-hmm. \n8 A \nAnd so, I would say positive. \n9 \nQ \nOkay. So, now turning to the Epstein case. \n10 A \nYeah. \n11 Q \nNow that your recall has \nbeen refreshed by virtue \n12 \nof the documents we've \nprovided, before we get into the \n13 actual sort of documents and some \nof the details of the \n14 \nevents, would you please give us a \ngeneral overview of what \n15 you currently remember, refreshed, \nabout how the case came \n16 \ninto the U.S. Attorney's Office, \nhow it was assessed for \n17 prosecution, and how \nand why the decision was made to \nresolve \n18 \nit with a two-year state plea \nthat ultimately became an 18 --\n19 A \nOkay. \n20 Q \n-- I mean, \nyeah, a two year state plea that \n21 \nultimate became --\n22 \nA All \nright. \n23 \nQ \n-- an 18 month state \nplea. \n24 A \nOkay, \nso --\n25 \nMR. HERRON: Before \nyou answer the question, let \nme \nEFTA00009255\n\nPage \n28 \n1 just jump in \non the notion of refresh \nyour recollection, \n2 which is -- of \ncourse has a very specific legal \nmeaning, and \n3 I think \nto assert that Mr. Acosta's \nrecollection has been \n4 \nrefreshed generally probably \noverstates it. It's \nreally a \n5 document by \ndocument, issue by issue \nthing. So, I'd push \n6 back \non that --\n7 \nMS. :  I --\n8 \nMR. \nHERRON: -- a \nlittle \nbit, \nbut the \nquestion is \n9 \nfair and accurate. \n10 \nMS. :  If you're \ntalking about handing him \n11 a \ndocument to refresh an exhausted \nrecollection, that's not \n12 the \nprocess we're talking about. \nWe're using it in a more \n13 lay \nterm that, you know, if we asked you \nthis before, giving \n14 you all \nthese documents, you'd probably \nwould have not been \n15 \nable to be as full in your responses. \nSo, we're asking for \n16 your full response. \nThank you. \n17 \nMR. HERRON: We \nappreciate the opportunity to \n18 review \nthe documents, and Alex, in \nyour answers, try to \n19 distinguish what you actually recall --\n20 THE \nWITNESS: Yeah. \n21 MR. HERRON: -- \nin your own head versus what you \n22 \nsaw in the \ndocuments. \n23 \nMS. :  Yeah. \n24 \nMR. HERRON: And \nthat would make for --\n25 \nMS. \n. \nThank \nyou. \nEFTA00009256\n\nPage 29 \nMR. HERRON: -- the cleanest record. \n2 \nTHE WITNESS: Okay. So, three parts. How did it \n3 come into the office? How did -- I'm sorry --\n4 \nBY \nMS. \n5 \nQ How was -- how did it come in? \n6 \nA \nRight. \nQ How was it assessed for \nprosecution --\n8 \nA \nRight. \nQ -- and then how and -- how and why the decision was \nmade \n--\nA \n• -- to resolve it the way it was. \n13 \nA So, so, let's begin with how did \nit come into the \n14 office. Putting all the documents aside, I can't say with \n5 \ncertainty how it came in. I can speculate how it \ncame in, \n16 and the way it would have come into the office is can \n17 speculate that the chief -- the chief rider from Palm Beach \n18 \nCounty \nwould have brought \nit to \neither the FBI \nor to the \nPalm \n19 Beach Office. I'm not certain that I would have asked who \n20 \nbrought this \ncase to the \noffice as opposed to the case \nis \nnow \n21 \nin the office, so let's --\n22 \nQ \nRight. \n23 \nA \n-- \nlet's discuss \nit, right? \nThe \nformat, or \nthe \n24 mode in which it came in I think is important, because my \n25 \nrecollection \nis it arrived to \nus in \nthe position that \nthe \nEFTA00009257\n\nPage 30 \n1 \nstate attorney had negotiated a plea, and that the reason \n2 that we looked at it was that that plea was going to be --\n3 that there had been an initial charge that \nwasn't pursued, \n4 \nand that required jail time \nand registration, and that the \nS \nplea that was going to be taken was a charge that didn't \n6 require jail time, and didn't require registration, \nand based \n7 \non the \npreliminary \nassessment of the \nfacts, \nthat \nseemed --\n8 that seems wrong. So, that's how did it arrive. The next \n9 question \nwas --\n10 Q \nHow was it assessed for federal \nprosecution? \n11 A So -- so, it was assessed \nfor federal prosecution, \n12 my recollection, from -- from very early on, and I'm \nsure \n13 we'll talk about this some more, is \nyou have a case that, \n14 while technically it wasn't final at \nthe state level, but for \n15 federal involvement, would have been \nfinal, and -- and so \n16 from \nthe earliest point, we were thinking federal versus \n17 state and petite, and the contemporaneous record sort of \n18 \nshows at least the material that \nI got, the earliest \n19 communication was Mr. \ntelling \nme that \nis \n20 preparing a petite policy waiver -- that Ms. is \n21 preparing a petite policy waiver, and that's consistent with \n22 my recollection of how it was assessed, and -- and then \n23 brought in -- assessed, you know, does it make sense to go \n24 forward, yes, investigate, and circle back. And then -- and \n25 then the third part was the --\nEFTA00009258\n\nPage \n31 \n1 \n2 \nQ \nHow \nand \nwhy \nthe \ndisposition. \nA \nSo, \nmy \ngeneral \nrecollection \nis \nthe \nview \nwas \nthat \nif \n3 \nthe \nstate \nhad \nfollowed \nthrough \non \nan \noriginal \ncharge \n-- \nI \n4 \ndon't \nrecall \nwhich \n-- \nthat \ncalled \nfor \njail \ntime \nand \nthat \n5 \ncalled \nfor \nregistration, \nthat \nthe \nlocal \npolice \nor \nwhoever \n6 \nbrought \nit \nwould \nnot \nhave \nseen \nthe \nneed \nto \nrefer \nit. \n7 \nAnd \nso, \nthat \nwas \nin \nterms \nof \npre\n-indictment \n8 \nresolution, \na \n-- \na \nlogical \nand \nreasonable \nplace \ngiven \nall \nthe \n9 \nother \nsort \nof \nfactors, \nboth \nthe \npetite \nconcerns, \nthe \nwitness \n10 \nconcerns, \nand \nthe \nlegal \nconcerns. \n11 \nAnd \nto \nthat, \nI \nwould \nadd \na \nfourth \nconcern, \nwhich \nis \n12 \nit \nhad \nalready \nbeen \nreviewed \nby \na \ngrand \njury \nat \nthe \nstate \n13 \nlevel, \nis \nmy \nrecollection. \nAnd \nso, \nto \nsome \nextent, \nthat's \n14 \nindicative \nof \nhow \nsome \nindividuals \nmay \nsort \nof \nview \nthis \n15 \nmatter. \n16 \nQ \nOkay. \nWe're \ngoing \nto \npick \nthat \napart. \n17 \nA \nI \nfigured. \n18 \nQ \nBut \nthank \nyou \nfor \nthat. \n19 \nA \nYou \n-- \nyou \nasked \nfor \nan \noverview, \nso \nI \ntried \nto \n20 \njust \nbe \nvery \n--\n21 \nQ \nYeah. \n22 \nA \n-- \ngeneral. \n23 \nQ \nThat \ndoesn't \n-- \nthat \ndoesn't \n-- \nthe \nsecond \npart \nof \n24 \nthat \nlast \nprong \nwas \n-- \nwas \nwhy \na \ntwo \nyear \nstate \nplea. \nIn \n25 \nother \nwords, \nyou \ntalked \nabout \n-- \nyou \ntalked \nabout \nassessing \nEFTA00009259\n\nPaGe \nthe case and why resolve \nit, but why with a two year state \n2 plea? What's the --\n3 \n5 \nA And \nso --\n4 \n-- overview? \nA And so my \ngeneral recollection is -- my \n6 understanding -- if I was asked, \nwhat is the best \n7 understanding that I have of why two years, is that is what \n8 would have been obtained in one of \nthe original state \n9 \ncharges. Again, this is --\n10 Q \nHow do you know that? \nA \n12 Q \nHow did you know that? \n13 A \nI'm -- that's why I say general recollection. I'm \n14 \nreconstructing memories of that 12 years ago. I can \n15 \nspeculate that at some point, the matter came up, and I or \n16 someone else said if, you know, what would the original --\n17 \nwhat would the original plea have -- you know, what would the \n18 original charges have likely brought? And someone said this \n19 amount. \n20 Q \nHow would have said that? \n21 \nA I -- I'm speculating at this point. I don't have a \n22 recollection, but -- but that's -- that's my general \n23 understanding. \n24 \nQ All right. All right. We'll now unpack --\n25 \nA \nYeah, I --\nEFTA00009260\n\nPage 33 \n1 \n2 \n3 \nQ -- some of \nthat. \nA -- I noticed. \nQ And by the \nway, my colleagues, we're all \nin this \n4 boat \ntogether. So, they're going to feel \nfree to --\n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nA \nI \nknow. \nQ \n-- chime in --\nA \nYeah. \nQ as they \nsee fit. So, the first thing \ngoing --\n9 going to \nthe intake of the case, we \nknow from the records \n10 \nthat -- and by \nthe way, we've obviously done a \ngreat deal of \n11 \nother investigation --\n12 \nA \nRight. \n13 Q \n-- and \nspoken to many people. So, \n14 \nbriefed you and \npretty much when the case \nfirst \n15 \ncame \nin --\n16 A \nMm-hmm. \n17 Q \n-- in mid-2006, after the \nFBI and indeed the \n18 office -- the \nU.S. Attorney's Office in West Palm \nhad opened \n19 the case, but before \nEpstein was indicted. So, \nthis first \n20 \nexhibit, Exhibit No. 1 that \nyou have in your binder before \n21 you -- \nor, in your folder before you -- \nis that e-mail from \n22 \nto you that you \njust referred to dated July 24 --\n23 A Right. \n24 Q \n-- 2006, in which he's sort of \npassing on the \n25 \ninformation that Epstein has by \nnow been arrested -- been \nEFTA00009261\n\nPage 34 \n1 indicted -- \narrested and indicted by the state. \nDo you \n2 recall anything \nabout that original briefing from \n3 \n4 \nA \nI -- \nI don't. \n5 \nQ All right. Did \nyou know at the time that -- at the \n6 \ntime she \nbriefed you --\n7 \nA Mm-hmm. \n8 \nQ -- \nwhich is prior to Exhibit 1, did \nyou know who \n9 \nEpstein \nwas? \n10 \nA \nI did \nnot. \n11 \nQ \nNever heard of him, to your \nknowledge? \n12 A To my knowledge, I don't \nrecall having heard of \n13 \nhim. \n14 Q \nAnd what did you understand at that \nearly point the \n15 case \nto be about? \n16 \nA \nSo, \nI don't recall the briefing, and so I \ncan't \n17 give an independent \nrecollection. You know, based on this, I \n18 mean, \nthe --\n19 Q \nYou're talking about Exhibit \n1, and you're --\n20 A Based on --\n21 \nQ \n-- looking at --\n22 A -- based on Exhibit 1, you know, I can -- I can \n23 \ninfer that this would have been my general \nunderstanding of \n24 the case, and you \nknow, and the key things that I point here \n25 is pre-trial diversion, which is \ncode for no jail time, and \nEFTA00009262\n\nPage \n35 \n1 petite \npolicy. \n2 Q \nBut \nthis -- what -- Exhibit No. 1 --\n3 A \nRight. \n4 \nQ -- does not make it clear to you that this case \n5 involved allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had been enticing, \n6 \ncoercing, whatever verb you want to use, young, underage \n7 \nfemales -- we will for the record call them girls here --\n8 A Mm-hmm. \n9 Q \n-- \nas opposed to women, and these underage females \n10 were being paid to provide him essentially with sex, or \n11 \nsexual activity or conduct, of a pretty salacious nature. Do \n12 \nyou recall that as being essentially what you were briefed on \n13 \nfrom the beginning? \n14 A Again, I don't recall the initial briefing. I take \n15 it based on your review that there was an initial briefing. \n16 \nI can't say the degree \nof detail. I can't say what it was \n17 \nabout. As a -- as a \ntypical matter, I wouldn't be briefed \n18 when a case comes into the office other than being made \n19 aware, this is a case, this is what we're looking at. \n20 \nQ So, then, if you --\n21 \nA \nSure. \n22 \nQ \n-- understanding you don't \nremember the briefing, \n23 \nis it fair to say that you did have some \nunderstanding of \n24 \nwhat the \ncase that was that West Palm Beach was pursuing as \n25 of \nmid-2006? \nEFTA00009263\n\nPage 36 \n1 \nA I certainly had an understanding of the general \n2 \nfacts of the case early on. I can't speak to whether it was \n3 mid-2006 versus late 2006 versus 2007, but \n--\n4 \nQ \nMm-hmm. \n5 \nA -- early on, I certainly had an understanding that \n6 it was a case that involved, you know, a billionaire who was \n7 \ndoing sordid things with young women \nor girls who were \n8 \nminors. \n9 \nand the \nrecords indicate that her \n10 \nconcern in bringing this all the way to you --\n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \nA \nKm-hmm. \nQ \n-- and her first at that time criminal chief --\nA \nRight. \nQ \n-- but sort of acting First Assistant \nwas because she was afraid of political pressure that \nmight be brought to bear against the U.S. Attorney's Office \n17 in this case. Do you \nhave any recollection of that being a \n18 \nconcern that was laid before you? \n19 \nA I don't -- again, I don't recall the early -- that \n20 briefing. I've reviewed this e-mail, and -- and I can -- \nyou \n21 know, I take it it would have been natural for me to say, \n22 should we approach the state attorney, because we had lots of \n23 ongoing matters with the state attorney, and it seems that \n24 said no for fear it'll be leaked straight to Epstein, \n25 and I assumed I'd let it be at that point. \nEFTA00009264\n\nPage 37 \n1 \nQ And do you know -- \noh, do you know what he meant by \n2 it being leaked to Epstein by \nthe state -- by Barry -- Barry \n3 Krischer, the \nthen State Attorney? \n4 \nA So -- so, based on the context --\n5 \nQ Mm-hmm. \n6 \nA -- \nwhat I would assume is that if the state \n7 attorney is cutting this kind of deal, and it appears that \n8 things have already \nleaked, because you know, there's clearly \n9 and article here with leaked -- you \nknow, so, something has \n10 \nalready leaked. \n11 \nQ \nYou're referring to Exhibit 1? \n12 \nA Exhibit 1. Other things would leak. \n13 \nQ \nHad you ever met Barry Krischer? \n14 A \nSure. \n15 \nQ What was your relationship with him? \n16 \nA So, there were multiple \nstate attorneys within the \n17 district. He was -- it was a professional \nrelationship. We, \n18 you \nknow --\n19 \nQ \nIt was an elected position, \ncorrect? \n20 \nA It was an elected position. \n21 \nQ And what was your \nassessment \nof his aggressiveness \n22 as a \nprosecutor, and his capabilities? \n23 \nA On the public -- my -- most of my assessment with \n24 him was on the public \ncorruption front, where we had brought \n25 several cases, and I was a little disappointed that these \nEFTA00009265\n\nPage 38 \n1 were \ncases he could have brought that he chose not to bring. \n2 \nQ \nRight. So, is it -- can \nI \n-- am I accurate in \n3 \ninferring from that that you didn't regard him as a \n4 \nparticularly hard charging \nprosecutor? \n5 A So, I -- with any state attorney, I hesitate to \n6 sort of paint broad brush strokes. I don't think that's \n7 always fair, but my experience had been in the public \n8 \ncorruption space. \n9 Q \nYeah. \n10 A \nAnd in that space, I did not think -- whether it \n11 was him, \nor whether it was his office, I can't \nspeak, but I \n12 did not think they had done as much as they could have done. \n13 Q \nIs there any area in which you thought he and his \n14 office \ndid pursue aggressively? \n15 A So, as I recall, we had had -- we had emphasized \n16 gun crimes quite a bit, and \nreally had had a lot of success \n17 moving -- moving the ball \nin the gun crimes space in Palm \n18 Beach. \n19 Q \nWhat --\n20 \nA But let me -- let me just say, it's also very \n21 \ndifficult to reconstruct time frames. \n22 \nQ MM-hmm. \n23 A \nAnd so, I hesitate, because I don't know if that \n24 was 2006 \nor 2007, or -- but you asked in another area, and --\n25 \nQ In this Exhibit 1, you ask whether it's \nEFTA00009266\n\nPage 39 \n1 \nappropriate -- appropriate to \napproach Barry Krischer and \n2 give him a \nheads up as to where the U.S. \nAttorney's Office \n3 \nmight go, \npresumably --\n4 \nA Right. \n5 \nQ -- \nwith this case? \n6 \nA Correct. \n7 \nQ Why would you \nwant to extend that difference to \n8 \nhim? Why would it \nmatter? \n9 A \nA colleague in law enforcement. I thought it was \n10 important for the office \nto work with -- with state attorneys \n11 as a general matter, and I \nfound that the office worked best \n12 when it had good \nworking relationships with state \nattorneys \n13 and with -- you \nknow, with -- for that matter, the agency \n14 SACs and others, and --\n15 Q \nRight. \n16 \nA \n-- but \nagain, you know, rather than my \nasserting, \n17 \nI'm \nasking , and was saying no, and I don't know \n18 what the ultimate \noutcome was, but I would guess that we'd \n19 \njust defer and \nlet it be. \n20 \nQ \nTurning to Exhibit 2, this is an \ne-mail that was \n21 \nforwarded \nto you by \n22 \nmail is \nfrom \n, the original forwarded e-\ncopying \n, and \nit \n23 \nessentially relates to a dust up \nbetween \nand \n24 \nover chain of command, and her workload, but \n25 \nin the first paragraph, she specifies that, \"When \nI first \nEFTA00009267\n\nPage 40 \n1 \nheard about the Epstein \ninvestigation, I spoke with \n2 \nabout it. was not \nhere.\" \n3 \nsaid that she would back me up on the \ncase, \n4 but I \nknew what has happened to the \nstate prosecution can \n5 happen to the federal \nprosecution if the U.S. Attorney's \n6 Office isn't on \nboard. So, I spoke with about the case, \n7 \nand he spoke \nwith Alex, and they gave the green \nlight.\" \n8 \nSo, that \n-- that actually appears to be an initial \n9 \ncontact \nwith that she's \ntalking about prior to the \n10 briefing of you, \nso, way early when the case \nfirst came in in \n11 May of 2006. Do you \nrecall being contacted or \nhaving a \n12 \nconversation \nwith --\n13 \nA \nMm-hmm. \n14 \n- - about that \ncase so early? \n15 \nA Again, the early recollection, whenever -- \nwhenever \n16 it might have taken \nplace, was I was made aware of the \n17 matter. It seemed a \nreasonable matter to pursue, and that's \n18 the level of detail that I \nrecall. \n19 \nQ \nSo, if \nsaid back in the day \nthat she got from \n20 \nyou all the green light, what did you understand her \nto be \n21 being authorized to do -- \nauthorize may be too strong a word, \n22 \nbut \n--\n23 A \nSo, to pursue -- to investigate \n-- to pursue --\n24 Q \nYeah. \n25 A -- to someone, you know, I -- \nI'm speculating here, \nEFTA00009268\n\nPage 41 \n1 but \nthere's a case, and they want to \nknow, should we spend \n2 our time \non this? And the answer is \nit seems reasonable. \n3 \nSure. \n4 \nQ Okay, and \ndo you -- do you recall \nmaking that \n5 explicit to her? \n6 \nA I -- I don't, and -- \nand it wouldn't have been my \n7 practice to -- \nto sort of make it explicit to \n-- yeah, go \n8 spend \nyour time, as opposed to, \nthank you for letting me \n9 \nknow, that \nsounds reasonable. \n10 \nQ \nAll right. \n11 \nA And whatever, you \nknow, details it looks \nlike based \n12 on Exhibit 1, \nthere was subsequent follow up between \nher and \n13 \n, or with her and \nthe management team, and \nthey said, you \n14 \nknow, go back, work on \nA, B, and C. \n15 \nQ \nDo you know \nwhat was talking about \n16 when she referred to \nsomething happening to a federal \n17 prosecution if \nthe U.S. Attorney is not on \nboard? Had there \n18 been a case in which you \nwere not supportive of a \nparticular \n19 \nprosecution that was \nbeing proposed? \n20 A None -- \nnone that I recall, and -- and I knew \nthat \n21 what \nhas happened to the state \nprosecution can happen to a \n22 \nfederal prosecution if the \nU.S. Attorney's not on \nboard. I \n23 don't recall any federal \nprosecution that I wasn't supportive \n24 of, at \nleast in -- in this context. \n25 Q \nWhat do you mean by this \ncontext? \n ,11•111•1 \nEFTA00009269\n\nPage 42 \n1 A \nIt was my way \nof narrowing an answer so \nI didn't \n2 spend the time to go \nthrough every office and \nevery division. \n3 For the most \npart, as I sit here, I'm \nsort of running through \n4 each office. \nI don't recall any, and \n-- and if I could, \n5 based on this -- on \nExhibit 2, I'm not sure that \nshe's \n6 \nreferring to a \nspecific case as opposed to \nconcerns that the \n7 state \nprosecution started at point -- \nyou know, with charges \n8 that required jail \ntime and ended up somewhere else, \nand it \n9 may \nhave been because management --\n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \nQ \nAll \nright. \nA -- wasn't. \nQ \nBut that's -- that's a current -- a \nreading of --\nA \nYeah. \nQ \n-- \nthis, rather --\nA \nThat -- that's \nmy --\nQ -- \nthan a recollection? \nA \n-- \nthat's my \nreading, not --\nQ \nAll right. Based on \nthe early description you \ngot \n19 \nof the \ncase --\n20 A \nRight. \n21 \nQ \n-- did you have any \nidea how many victims were \n22 \ninvolved? \n23 A \nI did \nnot. \n24 \nQ \nDid you know what the \nname of the case was? What \n25 \nthe \ninvestigation's name was? You know, cases get names. \nEFTA00009270\n\nPage 43 \n1 A \nSo, I know \nthat based on review of the \n2 \ncorrespondence, I may have \nknown that then. I did \nnot \n3 independently \nrecall that. \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nQ That being Operation Leap Year? \nA Correct. \nQ All right, and \ndo you know where \nthat comes from? \nA I \nhave -- well, I mean, \nother than February 20 \n--\n8 yeah, I don't know. \n9 \nQ Well, the original \nallegations that came in \n10 \ninvolved 28 \nvictims, and then subsequently \n11 \nshe was uncovering more \nvictims, so there were --\n12 \nA \nYeah. \nadvised that \n13 Q -- \nover 30 victims. \n14 \nA \n15 \nQ Well over 30. \n16 A \nI did not know that. \n17 Q \nAll right. You did not \n-- you -- as you sit \nhere \n18 today, \nyou didn't know it? \n19 \nA I don't recall knowing \nthat. \n20 Q \nBut is \nit -- is it reasonable that \nthe number of \n21 \nvictims would be one of the \nfactors that you would \nhave been \n22 \ninformed of at \nthe time? \n23 A I -- I \ndon't know. I -- it all \ndepends how \n24 \ndetailed that briefing \nwas. Again, as a typical \nmatter early \n25 on, \nthis is what is being done. I would \ntrust my AUSAs and \nEFTA00009271\n\nPage 44 \n1 my \nmanagement \nstaff --\n2 \nQ \nRight. \n3 \nA \n-- to pursue it. It wouldn't be a, here are all \n4 the \nfacts associated with this case, just \nheads up. There is \n5 a high profile case \ninvolving a very wealthy man \nabusing \n6 young women, a state attorney \nis prosecuting, but you know, \n7 there's dissatisfaction. I wanted to give you a \nheads up, \n8 both to inform me, but \nalso so that I'm aware in my \n9 \ninteractions with -- with other Palm \nBeach officials. \n10 Q \nOkay. Based on whatever information you got at the \n11 \ntime, did you think that \nthere was a federal interest \nto be \n12 served by \npursuing a federal prosecution \npotentially? \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nglossary convention --\n22 \nA Right. \n23 \nQ -- \nthat we are using is -- and we can use in this \nA Yes. \nQ And \nwhat was that? \nA So, the exploitation of young women. \nQ Girls. \nA \nGirls. \nQ I want to be -- I want to be --\nA Minors. Minor females. \nQ \nAll right. \nI \n-- you know, for a -- for a sort of a \n24 \ninterview, is girls --\n25 \nA Right. \nEFTA00009272\n\nPage \n45 \n1 \nQ \n-- for the victims \nwho at the time of the \nconduct \n2 \nwere minors, and women, for those \nwho were not, even though \n3 \nthe girls at a later \ntime became age of --\n4 \nA Fair. \n5 \nQ \n-- \nmajority. \n6 A \nFair. \n7 \nQ \nOkay. So, \nhere, we're really talking about the \n8 \ngirls --\n9 A \nOkay. \n10 \nQ \n-- who were \nvictims. \n11 \nA \nYeah, \nyeah. \n12 \nQ \nOkay. \n13 A \nGirls, minor females. I just don't \nsometimes \n14 \nthat term is viewed \ndifferently. And so --\n15 Q \nRight. \n16 A \nYeah, so the exploitation \nof girls or minor \n17 \nfemales, and that certainly is an \nimportant federal interest. \n18 \nQ Well, and \nis the number and the breadth of the \n19 scheme -- the scope \nof the activity also a factor there? \nIn \n20 \nother words, it wasn't one or \ntwo on one or two occasions. \n21 A \nSo, there's several \nfactors that probably go into \n22 \nwhat's the federal \ninterest. The acts, the sordidness of \nthe \n23 acts, the -- the number, the \nlikelihood or the importance of \n24 \nregistration was important to my mind \nbecause that -- that \n25 goes to future \nprevention to putting the community \non notice. \nEFTA00009273\n\nPage \n46 \n1 \nQ \nAnd were you aware that \nthe individual in this \n2 case, \nEpstein, also had homes in \nother districts, and that \n3 there were \n-- it was an interstate \nactivity on his part, the \n4 \ninterstate travel \nand so on? \n5 A \n6 \nMR. HERRON: I'm \nsorry, let me just -- we're still \n7 in the original \nintake time frame --\n8 \nMS. \n: \nYes. \n9 MR. \nHERRON: -- here? \n10 \nTHE \nWITNESS: Yeah. Again, for the \nintake time, I \n11 \ncan't \nI can't \nspeak to the details, because \nI don't \n12 remember what the \nextent of that -- that \nintake briefing. \n13 \nBY \nMS. \n14 \nQ \nBut as i \n-- as I -- as i --\n15 \nA \nCould I -- could I ask --\n16 \nQ \nYes. \n17 \nA \n-- a question? Was there -- \nwas there a clear \n18 briefing as \nopposed to a heads up based \non the record? \n19 Q \nYes. That \ncame to \nMiami to conduct \n20 a \nbriefing of you and \n--\n21 A \nOkay. \n22 Q \nin order \nto tell you about this \n23 case, \nand get from \nyou \n24 A \nOkay. \n25 Q \n-- a green light --\nEFTA00009274\n\nPage 47 \n1 A \n2 \n3 \nQ -- to proceed with it. \nA I ask, \nbecause I recall an e-mail, and I don't \nknow \n4 what the time \nwould have been, where she's \ncoming to Miami, \n5 \nand says, why don't \nyou stop by my office first? \n6 \nQ \nRight. \n7 \nA And \n-- and -- and I keep -- I \nwould -- I would \n8 \nspeculate that, why don't you \nstop by my office first is, why \n9 don't \nyou give me a bunch of details, and \nthen we will walk \n10 across to \nthe U.S. Attorney --\n11 \nQ \nRight. \n12 A \n-- and fill \nhim in, \nand \nso \nthat would \nhave \nbeen \n13 almost a \ntwo-tiered discussion. \n14 \nQ \nAnd is that --\n15 A \nAnd I don't know if that -- if that -- \nthe timeline \n16 \non that e-mail is when you \nsay briefing. \n17 \nQ \nWell, \nwe are -- we are \nasking --\n18 \nA \n19 Q \nWhat it \n-- what it would --\n20 A Yeah. \n21 \n22 \nA I'm \nspeaking just based on review of the record, \n23 not based on recollection \nhere. \n24 Q \nAll right. So, you have -- \nto be clear, you have \n25 no recollection of any \nspecific briefing in 2006? \nEFTA00009275\n\n1 \n2 \n3 \nPage \n48 \nA \nI accept that I was \nmade aware of the matter. \nQ Okay. \nA I can't say \nhow or in what context or to what \n4 degree of detail. \n5 \n6 \nQ Or by whom? \nA \nOr by whom. I knew \nthe matter -- it's easier to \n7 recollect at \nleast for me what I knew as opposed \nto who told \n8 \nme what. \n9 \nQ \nAll right. All right. At this \npoint, would you \n10 have had -- did you have \n-- if you -- at any point, did \nyou \n11 \nhave any reservation about \ninvestigating and potentially \n12 prosecuting Jeffrey \nEpstein, a reservation stemming \nfrom his \n13 wealth, and \nreported standing in the community at \nall, and \n14 \ninfluence? \n15 A \nNo, and we had prosecuted lots of influential folks \n16 \nin the office. So, while he had \nwealth, it's not unusual --\n17 UBS was in the office at the time. I \nmentioned several high \n18 profile Palm \nBeach public corruption cases. \n19 \nQ So, there \nwas no concern about possible negative \n20 blowback in the press or \nthe community or even at Main \n21 Justice if you went after someone like Jeffrey \nEpstein? \n22 \nA There was no \nconcern stemming from his wealth or \n23 his status. \n24 \nQ \nWhat would it have stemmed \nfrom? \n25 A At some \npoint, I think there was concerns \nregarding \nEFTA00009276\n\nPage 49 \n1 \nthe -- the law, and we'll probably \nget into that. I alluded \n2 to that \nearlier in the overview. I don't \nknow if that would \n3 have been developed this \nearly on, but -- but that's not a \n4 function of his \nwealth. That's a function of the \nfact \n5 \npattern. \n6 \nQ Right. Right. Okay. \nSo, as you mentioned petite \n7   policy concerns, petite policy, \npetite policy, could you tell \n8 us \nwhat your position was on the \n-- on the policy as it \n9 \napplied in \nthis case as you understood it from -- in \nthe \n10 \nbeginning? \n11 \nA So -- so, the \npolicy, you know, on its face, \n12 doesn't specifically \napply. Based on Exhibit 1, I'm now \n13 inferring, not \nrecalling, it looks like either \non her \n14 \nown, or asked for a \n-- or, Mr. , \nasked for a \n15 petite policy waiver \nmemo to be prepared, in part on \nthe \n16 \nassumption that the state prosecution \nmay or may not have \n17 \ngone \nfor \nit. \n18 I don't \nknow, but I know -- I do recall \nthat early \n19 on, this \nwas unusual, because it had been -- he \nhad been \n20 arrested or \narraigned. It was going forward on the part of \n21 \nthe state, and so here is the big \nbad federal government \n22 stepping on a sovereign, you \nknow, state, saying you're not \n23 doing enough, and to my mind, \nwhen, you know, the whole idea \n24 of the petite policy is to \nrecognize that that estate has --\n25 you know, is \nan independent entity, and that we \nshould \nEFTA00009277\n\nPage \n50 \n1 \npresume that what they're doing is \ncorrect, even if we don't \n2 \nlike the outcome, except in the \nmost unusual of \n3 \ncircumstances. \n4 \nQ And what \nkinds of -- well, so, the petite policy \n5 exists because \nthere's a recognition that there are cases \n6 that are appropriately pursued. I \nmean, you were the head of \n7 \nthe civil rights \ndivision, after all. \n8 \nA Correct, which is why I say \nexcept in the most \n9 \nappropriate of circumstances. \n10 \nQ \nRight. \n11 A But let me add \nthat based on this, I was \n12 comfortable, \nyou know, saying, let's go forward, because the \n13 lack \nof jail time, you know, to use -- to use petite policy \n14 language, a plea \nthat did not include jail time or \n15 registration \nwould seem like a manifest injustice. \n16 Q All \nright. So, did you have any doubt that you'd \n17 get a waiver if \nyou applied for one? \n18 \nA \nI'm not -- so -- so, I'm now speculating. I don't \n19 \nrecall, but I'm not sure I would have said, is there a doubt \n20 that I'd \nget a waiver as opposed to, is this something I \nfeel \n21 comfortable doing, or not? And --\n22 \nQ \nAnd this being the \nprosecution, or this being \n23 the -- applying for a waiver? \n24 \nA Applying for a waiver. And \nso, you know, either \n25 \nmain justice \ngives it or doesn't give it. That doesn't \nmean \nEFTA00009278\n\nPage 51 \n1 you don't apply for it if you think it's the right thing \nto \n2 \ndo. \n3 \nSo, for example, in the \nUBS case, which was one of \n4 \nour big tax, \nyou know, \nprosecutions, we asked for a Bank of \n5 Nova Scotia --\n6 \nQ \nME-hum. \n7 \nA -- authorization to the Bank of Nova Scotia \n8 subpoena, and I didn't think Main Justice would -- you know, \n9 I pushed really hard, and I got into the weeds in that case \nfor that purpose, but I still thought, let's go \nfor it, and \nwe \ndid, and Main Justice didn't give in to it, and \nthat's \n12 okay. That's how it works. \n13 \nQ Okay. So, they \ndenied that request? \n14 A They denied that request, and I say that as an \n15 example of -- as a typical matter, I don't think what's main \n16 justice going to say, as opposed to how do we how should \n17 \nwe approach this matter? \n18 \nQ I don't understand about what you mean by, how \n19 should we approach this matter. \n20 A So, honestly, how do I -- how do I explain this? \n21 \nSo, I think there's a difference in saying, let me predict \n22 how main justice will come out, and follow that prediction, \n23 versus, folks, what do you all think? Okay. If we're \n24 comfortable with this, let's write it up, and let's see what \n25 Main Justice does. \nEFTA00009279\n\nPage 52 \n1 \nOne is trying to \npredict what folks in this \n2 building are going to \nthink. Another one is trying to \n3 predict -- another \none is saying, what do we in Miami think, \n4 and then let main justice figure it out. \nQ And which is the \napproach you typically took? \n6 \nA \nAnd my point is the approach that I typically took \n7 \nis, what do we think, and let main justice \ngive it a thumbs \n8 up or a thumbs down. \n9 \nQ All right, and in this case, did \nyou do that with \n10 \nregard \nto the petite policy? \n11 \nA So, in this case, we didn't get that far in that we \n12 didn't have to submit to \nDOJ. \n13 \nQ MM-hmm. \n14 A But -- but we were approaching it not based \non what \n15 \nmain justice was going to think, but what do we feel is the \n16 right outcome in this \noffice. \n17 Q \nSo, as I understand, the \nbottom line is that you \n18 \ndidn't as I hear you, I believe you're saying that you \n19 didn't stand down, or in any way cease or limit pursuing this \n20 \ncase on petite policy grounds. You pursued it as you -- as \n21 \nyou would --\n22 A So, we went forward with the matter, although there \n23 \nwere petite policy concerns in the background. So -- so \n24 you're setting this up as a \nbinary -- as a -- did -- was it a \n25 fact -- as a binary, you did not limit \nyourself on petite \nEFTA00009280\n\nPage 53 \n1 \npolicy \ngrounds, and I'm pushing back a little \nbit, because I \n2 \ndon't think it's, it's part or it's not, as opposed to when \n3 you \nlook at a case, there are all \nsorts of factors, and it is \n4 a factor in how you think of a \nmatter going forward. \nBY \nMS. \nQ \nIf you \nhad those petite policy concerns -- you or \nmembers of \nyour staff? \n8 A \nI would say a combination of me and my management \n9 \nstaff. \n11 \n3 \n14 \nBY \nMS. \nQ Who? Who? \nA \nI can't \n-- I can't recreate \n--\nQ \nBut \nwho are you dealing with on this case? \nA Primarily, it would be my first \nassistant and \n15 criminal chief as I typically -- so, \nthere is, you know, to \n16 sort of put it \nin main justice terms, you know, a line \n17 attorney has a \ndeputy section chief and a section chief and a \n18 DAG and an AAG, and the AAG \nusually deals with the section \n19 chief, or the DAG. And so, I \nwas dealing with my first \n20 assistant and my crim chief. \n21 \nQ \nRight, and they were there in Miami. \n22 \nA And they were there in Miami. \n23 \nQ And by \nthe way, \nfirst line \n24 \nsupervisor was \n25 A rect. \nEFTA00009281\n\nPage 54 \n1 \nQ \nDo you know \nwhy she was not actively participating \n2 in this chain of \ncommand? \n3 \nA I noticed that in the \ncorrespondence, and I \n4 couldn't speak to that. \n5 \nQ All \nright. \n6 \nA But the -- but it goes to the point \nthat if you \nlook at the -- she reported to , who \nreported \nto \n8 \nwho reported to who reported to \n. \nAnd so, \nas a \n9 typical \nmatter, I tried to empower my first assistant and my \n10 criminal chief and my office heads and \nwork through them, not \n11 bypass them. \n12 Q \nIn this particular case \nwith regard either to the \n13 \npetite policy \n--\n14 A Right. \n15 Q \n-- or any other aspect, was \nthere anyone other than \n16 \nthat group of five, if you will, in \nthat chain --\n17 \nA \nCorrect. \n18 Q \n-- from you down to \nthrough \n19 \n20 \nA \nRight. \n21 Q \n-- and that you were dealing with? \n22 A I can't recall.

At this point, what I \nwant to do is draw your \n4 \nattention to the -- \nthe comment, and his response, \nand we're \n5 looking at page --\n6 A \nPage --\n7 \nQ \n-- \nthree. \n8 A -- page \nthree. \n9 \nQ \nSo, in the third paragraph --\n10 \nA \nYeah. \n11 \nQ \n-- \"it was made clear to \nyou by the U.S. Attorney \n12 \nand the first assistant \nfrom the time when you were first \n13 \nauthorized to \ninvestigate Mr. Epstein that the office had \n14 \nconcerns about taking \nthe case because of petite policy and a \n15 \nnumber of legal issues.\" \nAnd then later he says that, \n\"You \n16 \nwere never given \nauthorization by anyone to seek an \n17 indictment in this case.\" \n18 \nAnd -- \nclose quote -- and then on the first page, \n19 \npresents her version of that original \ncontact \n20 with you, meeting with \nyou, at the bottom of the page. \n21 Halfway \nthrough the last paragraph, \nshe says, \"My \n22 \nrecollection of the original \nmeeting with Alex and is \n23 \nquite different than your summary. \nIn that meeting, I \n24 \nsummarized the case and the state \nattorney's office handling \n25 \nof \nit.\" \nEFTA00009284\n\n1 \nPage 57 \nacknowledged that we needed \nto do work to \n2 collect the \nevidence establishing a federal \nnexus, and I \n3 noted \nthe time and month,\" -- \nthat -- I'm sorry, \"I noted \nthe \n4 \ntime and money that would \nbe required for an \ninvestigation. \n5 I said I was willing \nto invest time and the FBI was \nwilling \n6 to invest the \nmoney, but I didn't want to \nget to the end of \n7 it,\" -- \n\"to the end, and then have the office be \nintimidated \n8 by the high \npowered lawyers.

What's \nher job then? \n2 \nA \nSo, the job would then be \nto go back and \n3 investigate, and \ndevelop facts and report back. \n4 \nQ \nAnd if she developed enough facts, \nand supportive \n5 law to present proposed prosecution? \n6 \n7 \n8 \nA Right. \nQ \nOkay. \nA And so -- so, \na lot of times in this he said, she \n9 said, there's a little bit of truth to both \nsides of the \n10 discussion. I'm \njust -- I'm just saying as a \ngeneral matter, \n11 I wouldn't -- your questions \nare sometimes either or, and \n12 \nsometimes --\n13 \nQ \nRight. \n14 \nA -- it can be a combination of both. \n15 \nQ All right, and -- but in fact you don't recall? \n16 \nA But I'm \nspeculating. \n17 \nQ All right. Is there anything in \neither of those \n18 that two \naccounts -- two versions that you say didn't \nhappen, \n19 \ncouldn't \nhappen? \n20 \nA I can't, because I don't recall it. I can't --\n21 \nQ Okay. \n22 A -- speak \nto that. I would speculate that there's \n23 probably a \nlittle bit of truth on both sides that -- and if \n24 you read it \nclosely, you'll see that acknowledges the \n25 need to work on a federal nexus. So, that goes to, you know, \nEFTA00009286\n\nPage \n59 \n1 where \nor, Mr. la \nI'm sorry, I'm \ncalling -- I'm \n2 using \nfirst names. \n3 Q \nIts' all right. \n4 A So, \nI'm going to just start --\n4 \nThis is an informal \ninterview. \n6 \nA I'm going to just \nstart using first \nnames. I don't \n7 \nmean that \ndisrespectfully -- where, \nyou know, Illlisays, \nyou \n8 \nknow, because of petite \npolicy and legal \nissues, and \nis \n9 acknowledging \nthe legal issues, \nbecause she's saying \nneeded \n10 \nwork to do to \ncollect evidence \nestablishing the federal \n11 \nnexus. \n12 \nQ \nAll right. \n13 A \nSo --\n14 \nQ \nYeah. \n15 \nA So, \nthey're not as \ninconsistent as presented \n16 \nQ All \nright. \n17 \nA \n-- \narguably. \n18 Q \nSack in 2006, in this Exhibit No. \n1, \n19 tells you in his \ne-mail that the \nindictment target date is \n20 \nAugust 25, 2006. \n21 A Mm-hmm. \n22 \nQ \nIn other words, \nvery shortly --\n23 \nA \nRight. \n24 \nQ -- \nthereafter, within a \nmonth or so. Do you \nknow \n25 \nwhy the line AUSA, \n, was keen on \ngetting the \nEFTA00009287\n\nfederal case against \nEpstein brought on a \nfairly -- on a \n2 \nquick basis? \n3 \nA So, I can't speak \nto that, and -- and can I \n4 \nI ask, based on \nyour record, was that \nthat the -- was that \n5 the state \nindictment target \ndate, or was that \n--\n6 \nQ \nHe \nalready --\nA -- a federal --\nB \nQ \n-- \nEpstein had already been \nindicted and arraigned \non the --\n10 \nA Right. \n11 \nQ \n-- \nindictment, so that's \nthe federal. \n12 \nA \nSo -- so, \nthat's --\n1: \nQ That's talking about a \nfederal indictment. \n14 \nA All right. \n15 \nQ \nThe point \n--\n16 \nA Correct. \n17 Q \n-- is that early on --\n18 \nA \nRight. \n19 \nQ -- \nthe \ninvestigative team, the FBI \n--\n20 \nA Right. \n21 \nQ \n-- and were hot to \ntrot to get \n22 \nthis --\n23 \nA \nRight. \n24 Q \n-- case moving \nfrom a federal \nstandpoint. That may \n25 \nwell have been \nquite unrealistic given --\nEFTA00009288\n\nPage 61 \n1 A \nCorrect. \n2 \nQ -- all of the \nissues that we've \nbeen discussing, \n3 but the \nquestion is, do you know why \nthere was some \nurgency? \n4 A \nI haven't the \nslightest idea. When was \nit -- when \n5 was it \ninitially brought to the \noffice? \n6 \nQ \nIt was \nbrought to the office \nin May of --\n7 A \nRight. \n8 \nQ \n-- \n2006. \n9 \nA That -- that \nwould be a really, \nreally fast \n10 timeline. \n11 \nQ \nRight. So, the \nquestion is, aspirational \nthough it \n12 \nmay have \nbeen, there was a \nhope --\n13 A \n14 \nQ \n-- to get it done \nquickly. \n15 A Right. \n16 \nQ \nSo, the question is, \ncan you think of \nfactors that \n17 would \nhave led a \nprosecutor to want to \npursue --\n18 \nA I --\n19 \nQ \n-- \nthis quickly? \n20 A \nI don't recall. \nI can speculate that \nwas \n21 very hard \ncharging and wanted to do \na lot, and --\n22 \nQ \nWas that your \nexperience of her? \n23 A \nSo, based on this, I \nsee, you know, so, Exhibit \n2 \n24 is, you know \n25 \nQ \nExcuse me, would \n-- but just from your \nmemory, is \nEFTA00009289\n\nPage 62 \n1 that your \nrecollection of hove \noperated? Hard \ncharging? \n2 \nA \nYeah. I'd say -- so, \na lot of really \ngood \n3 \nprosecutors are hard \ncharging. That's --\n4 \nQ All \nright. \n5 \nA \n-- \nthat's \npart \nof the \njob description. \n6 \nQ \nOkay. \n7 \nA And so, \nyes. \n8 \nQ \nOkay. Did -- so, in \nthe child sex \noffender \n9 context, are you \nfamiliar with a -- the \nbelief on the part of \n10 \npeople who do that kind \nof case, as did \nand \n11 others in \nyour office -- that \nthose offenders \ntypically don't \n12 stop \noffending, even \nafter somebody's \nonto them? So that \n13 \nthere was a concern \nthat he -- that in this \ncase, Jeffrey \n14 Epstein \nmight be continuing \nto offend, and \ntherefore getting \n15 him \noff the streets \nwas --\n16 A Right. \n17 Q \n-- a \npriority? \n18 A \nI have heard that \ndiscussed recently in the media. \n19 I don't \nrecollect that back in -- part \nof a discussion back \n20 \nin \n2006. \n21 \nQ All right. \nOkay. Do you recall \nthat \n22 \n-- and this is \njust a, do you recall --\n23 A Mm-hmm. \n24 Q \n-- \nthat she periodically \nwould give you in that \n25 early \nperiod of 2006, \nupdates -- written \nupdates? \nEFTA00009290\n\nPage \n63 \n1 \n2 \nA \nI \ndon't. \nQ \nDid \nyou \nthink \nthat \nit \nwas \nappropriate \nfor \na \nline \n3 \nAUSA \nto \nbe \nshooting \ne\n-mails \nupdating \non \na \ncase \nthat \nwas \nunder \n4 \ninvestigation \ndirectly \nto \nyou \nand \nyour \nfirst \nassistant? \n5 \nA \nIt \nwas \nunusual, \nand \n-- \nand \nso, \nso, \ndid \nI \nthink \nof \n6 \na \n-- \nlook, \nI \ncan't \nreconstruct \nwhat \nI \nwould \nhave \nthought, \nbut \n7 \nyou \nknow, \nyou're \nasking \nnot \njust \nwhat \ndid \nI \nknow, \nbut \nwhat \n8 \nwould \nI \nhave \nthought \n12 \nyears \nago. \n9 \nBut \nI \ncan \nsay \nthat \nbased \non \ngeneral \npractice, \nit \n10 \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nunusual, \nand \nmy \nbest \nguess \nas \nto \nhow \nI \nwould \n11 \nhave \nreacted \nwould \nhave \nbeen, \nhey, \n, \nthis \nis \nunusual, \nis \n12 \nthe \nchain \nbeing \nfully \ninformed? \nAre \nfeathers \nbeing \n--\n13 \nQ \nRight. \n14 \nA \nruffled? \nFigure \nit \nout, \nbecause, \nyou \nknow, \nyou \n15 \nasked \nme \nearly \non \nto \ncharacterize \nqualities. \nI \nthink \n16 \none \nof \nthe \nthings \nthat \nI \nsaid \nwas \nhe \nwas \nvery \ngood \nat \n17 \nsmoothing \nthings \n--\n18 \nQ \nMW-hmm. \n19 \nA \n-- \nover. \nAnd \nsort \nof \nthe \ninteraction, \nbecause \nhe \n20 \nwas \nrespected, \nand \nso \nI \nmight \nsay, \nthat's \nkind \nof \nunusual. \n21 \nGo \nfigure \nit \nout. \n22 \nQ \nBut \nyou \nwouldn't \nnecessarily \njump \nthat \nchain \n23 \nyourself, \nand \nbe \n--\n24 \nA \n25 \nQ \n-- \nin \ndirect \ncommunication? \nEFTA00009291\n\nPage 64 \n1 \nA I \ntended not to --\n2 \nQ Okay. \n3 A -- do \nthat. \n4 \nBY \n5 \nQ Would she have \nsent this to you -- something \n6 unusual, if she \nthought that this was a case \nthat you wanted \n7 to be \ninvolved in? \n8 \nA \nEven in -- even in those, I \ntried to be, as a \n9 general matter, fairly \nsensitive to the chain, because \nI had \n10 \nfound that if you start jumping \nthe chain too much, even if \n11 you become \ninformed, managers feel, you \nknow, out of -- out \n12 of the loop, and that's not \n-- that's not conducive to sort \n13 of allowing them to do \ntheir job of supervising. It's a big \n14 enough \noffice, you have to empower \nyour folks to do their \n15 jobs. \n16 \nQ So the concern on your \npart would not be that she \n17 was communicating \ndirectly to you, but that as long as \nall of \n18 the \nchain was informed as well? \n19 A Yeah. I mean, if \nyou're -- if you're \n20 or \nyou know, if you're \n, or \nyou know, don't you \nwant to \n21 talk to \nthe line attorney before the line \nattorney talks to \n22 your boss? \n23 And so, it's not just \ninformed, but it's respecting \n24 your \nsupervisor.

Was that a typical \nway for an indictment \n2 \nand \nproposed prosecution? The memo to \ncome? \n3 A To my \nrecollection, it was not, and I \ndon't recall \n4 that happening \nin other cases. I'm trying -- I'm \nhesitating, \n5 \njust because I'm trying to \nthink through if there's -- \nI \n6 \ndon't have any recollection of \nit happening in another case. \n7 \nQ Why do you think it \nhappened in this case? \nAnd who \n8 \ncaused it to happen? \n9 \nA I \ndon't know, and I don't know. \n10 \nQ All right. All \nright. So, you when you \n11 before \nyou saw it -- I don't know if \nyou even knew about \n12 it -- you -- by reference \nto Exhibit 6, you learned \n13 \nessentially \nfrom that the FBI was planning \nto do \n14 a \npress conference two \nweeks after that, and \ntold \n15 \nthis \noffice has not approved the \nindictment, \n16 therefore, \"please do \nnot commit us to anything at this \n17 \ntime.\" Were you -- and eventually that e-mail \nchain --\n18 A \nRight. \n19 \nQ -- gets to \nyou, apparently by blind carbon, \nbecause \n20 \nthere's \nno \nindication you actually \nget it. \n21 \nA Right. \n22 \nQ But you advise Alicia \nValle, who I think was your \n23 \npress \nperson \n--\n24 A \nCorrect. \n25 \nQ -- that, ' hasn't \neven finished her \nEFTA00009298\n\nPage 71 \n1 \nrecommendation \ni.e., we are a long way \noff.\" So, \n2 did you \nhave any idea why the \nFBI was planning a \npress \n3 \nconference on \nEpstein? \n4 \nA I \ndon't -- I don't know \nif I did. I \ndon't recall \n5 \nif I did. \n6 \nQ \nWas it -- how \ntypical was it for \nthe FBI to plan a \n7 \npress conference on \nan indicted -- \non a case that was \nbeing \n8 \nindicted at the time \nof an indictment or \narrest without \n9 \ncoordinating that with you \nand your office? \n10 \nA \nUnder highly \natypical. \n11 \nQ He was \nthe SAC at the time? \n12 \nA \nHe was the SAC -- he \nwas the SAC -- I know he \nwas \n13 the SAC at \nthe time as of \nSeptember, and I'm almost \ncertain \n14 he was the \nSAC at the time. \n15 \nQ All \nright. And when you said \nthat we are a long \n16 \nway \noff, and hasn't even \nfinished her \nrecommendation to \n17 \n, can -- do you know \nwhether you had any idea \nthat she \n18 had actually \nsubmitted her pros \nmemo, and that she had \nmade a \n19 \nrecommendation to \n20 \nA \nI can't -- I can't \nrecollect --\n21 \nQ \nOkay. \n22 \nA \n-- but I'll take my words \nas reflective of, if I \n23 say she \nhasn't finished her \nrecommendation, then I assume \nshe \n24 hasn't finished \nher recommendation, but I \ndon't recall --\n25 \nQ \nDoes that mean --\nEFTA00009299\n\nPage 72 \n1 \nA -- that level of detail. \n2 \nQ -- as you -- as you look \nat your own words, does \n3 that suggest to you that \nyou were unaware as of that \nmoment \n4 that she'd \nactually submitted her pros \nmemo? \n5 \nA That suggests \nthat I would not have been aware \nthat \n6 she submitted it. If \n-- you know, because it sounds like I'm \n7 saying she \nhasn't even submitted her \nmemo to So --\n8 \nQ \nAll right. \n9 \nA \n-- \nwe're a long way off. \n10 \nQ All \nright, so, is --\n11 \nA \nBut again, \nthis is based on practice, \nnot \n12 \nrecollection. \n13 Q \nAll right, and when you said we are a long \nway off, \n14 did that reflect, if \nyou recall, an assessment of the \nlength \n15 \nof \ntime to get to a pros --\n16 A Right. \n17 \nQ \n-- memo, a recommendation, \nand an assessment of \n18 that, or your expectation that even when you saw a pros \nmemo\n19 and an \nindictment, it would be a long process \nbefore it was \n20 \napproved? \n21 \nA \nSo, I would assume \n-- and again, this is just based \n22 on speculating \nfrom the way that I write, that I'm thinking \n23 she hasn't \nsubmitted her recommendation to needs \n24 \nto review it. \n25 He may -- you know, he'd probably want \nto talk to \nEFTA00009300\n\nPage 73 \n1 \n.  It \nneeds to be scrubbed. You know, \nthis could be --\n2 this ain't happening \nnext week. \n3 \nQ \nAll right, but in your -- do \nyou have any reason to \n4 \nbelieve that whatever that \nprocess is that you were \n5 \ndescribing would be any -- \nany different in any \nparticular \n6 measure in this \ncase from the ordinary \ncomplex case? \n7 \nA So, from my \nlanguage, I would take that it's the \n8 same \nprocess, but that there is a \nprocess, and the process \n9 \nhasn't yet been \nfollowed. \n10 \nQ All right. Okay. \n11 \nA So, it would be the \ntypical process in a typical \n12 complex \ncase. \n13 \nQ All right, and is it fair \nto characterize this as a \n14 relatively \ncomplex case, given the \nlegal issues? \n15 \nA I think it is, \nyes. \n16 \nQ Okay. In Exhibit 8, you \nactually got the in \n17 Exhibit 7, you see \nthat in the bottom part of \nthat that you \n18 received a copy of the pros \nmemo on the second page of that \n19 \nexhibit at the \ntop. \n20 A Right. \n21 \nis \nforwarding to you the \npros memo. \n22 A Right. \n23 \nQ \nIn Exhibit 8, you see that \nis \n24 forwarding or \nsending to that chain, excluding \n25 \n, \nthat \nis, \nand you, additional \nEFTA00009301\n\nPage 74 \n1 items \nin Operation Leap Year, and \nthat's a summary of the \n2 \nindictment, and evidence regarding the \nindividual victims. \n3 Okay? So, as of May 11, you \nhad before you the pros memo, \n4 \nthe \nproposed indictment, and this substantial amount of \n5 \nadditional --\n6 A Right. \n7 \nQ -- information. \nDid you read the pros memo? \n8 A Right. So, I \ndon't recall -- and I know you're \n9 going to say, why don't \nI, but this was a long time ago. I \n10 don't recall if I \nread it, or if I went back to \nthe office \n11 \nand sat down with \nand and went over it. I \ncan't \n12 \nrecall from this far. I can say that it looks based on this \n13 \nthat I was at the U.S. Attorney's conference. \n14 \nQ \nMm-hmm, \n15 A \nThe idea of printing this out on a \nhotel printer, I \n16 wouldn't -- I can't believe I would \nhave printed this out on \n17 a hotel \nprinter. \n18 Q \nLet alone read it on an \nairplane, correct? \n19 A \nLet alone read it on an airplane. \nThat just \n20 \nwouldn't --\n21 \nQ \nRight. \n22 A -- have \nbeen my practice. \n23 \nQ But going back -- arriving back --\n24 A Right. \n25 Q \n-- to your office, \nwas it your practice to take \nEFTA00009302\n\nPage \n75 \n1 voluminous documents like this \nand go through them yourself, \n2 or \ndid you rely on your \nsenior staff? \n3 \nA \nI would \ntypically rely on senior \nstaff. They --\n4 \nthey're the experienced ones that have \nseen these matters \n5 before. They would \ngo through it. We'd sit down. We'd talk \n6 about the issues. \nWe might have it in front of us, almost \n7 \nlike you've got all those \nQ \nOkay. \n9 \nA -- binders there, but you \nknow, you're calling my \n10 \nattention to particular issues, and we'd \nsort of talk it \n11 \nthrough. \n12 Q \nAnd do you recall doing that in this \ncase? \n13 \nA I recall having discussions with \nsenior staff about \n14 this \ncase. \n15 Q \nWho? \n16 A Certainly \nand \nat \nvarious points, and \n17 I can't say that I did that in \nMay versus April versus June. \n18 I \ncan't give you \n19 \nQ \nAll right. \n20 \nA -- timelines. \n21 \nQ Well, we're talking now \nabout \nMay. \n22 A Right. \n23 \nQ \nBecause \nyou've got the actual --\n24 \nA Yeah. \n25 Q \n-- \nprocess. \nEFTA00009303\n\nPage 76 \n1 A It would \nhave been my practice based on \nthis to go \n2 back \nand discuss it, and so based on my practiced, I \nwould \n3 \nhave gone back and likely discussed it. \nI doubt I would have \n4 printed this out at whatever hotel I was at. \n5 \nQ But even when \nyou got back to the office, would you \n6 have had \nsomebody print it out so you would've had \nit \n7 available? \n8 A \nI may have had someone print it out \nso it's \n9 available. I may have \nfocused on particular parts of it. \n10 Q \nWhat kinds of issues would you \nhave focused on? In \n11 other \nwords -- in other words, some might \ngo straight to the \n12 \nfacts. \n13 \nA \nRight. \n14 \nQ \nSome might be interested in \nthe legal theories. \n15 \nWhat was -- what was your \napproach? \n16 A \nSo, I think that depended on the case. \n17 Q \nOkay. \n18 A Here, you had \nlegal questions, and you also had --\n19 had witness issues, and \nI would think those would have been \n20 the two primary \nareas. \n21 \nQ \nWould you have gone through the indictment and the \n22 pros memo \nand all of those other materials, \nor just relied on \n23 \nyour experience seeing your people, \nand \n24 A \nAs a general practice, probably some combination. \n25 As a general -- a general \nrecollection, the concerns in this \nEFTA00009304\n\nPage \n77 \n1 case weren't about the sordid \ndetails of what happened, \n2 because we believed he did what he \ndid. The concerns were \n3 about some of the \nlegal issues around it, and some of the \n4 issues in \nterms of testimony. \n5 \nQ \nOf the victims? \n6 \nA \nOf the victims. \n7 \nQ \nAll \nright. On page --\n8 \nA And I say \nthat because that would have been what I \n9 would \nnaturally focus on as opposed to \nreading the sordid \n10 details, \nbecause I think everyone believed the victims. \n11 \nQ All right. Exhibit 9 is \nan e-mail that you are not \n12 on, but that -- \nnotes that is advising that \n13 \nyou, , \"Has \nyour memo and Lefcourt's letter.\" \nGerald \n14 \nLefcourt was --\n15 \nA \nMm-hmm. \n16 Q \n-- a New York attorney who was one of the members \n17 of the \nEpstein defense team. Did you know \nhim? \n18 A I did \nnot. \n19 Q \nDid you ever encounter him as far as you recall? \n20 A I did \nnot. \n21 Q \nAll right.

I mean, he was he \n7 was right across, so we \nworked closely, but you know, \n8 \nwas the criminal chief, and if he was in \nthe weeds, , I \n9 would \nspeculate would sort of, much like me, defer \nto his \n10 judgement, because \nthey've known each other, and they've \n11 worked together, and \nthey had a good working \nrelationship. \n12 \nQ \nAnd is it \n-- do we understand correctly that as \n13 \nfirst  tant, had a brief that really encompassed \n14 \nthe entire office? \n15 \nA \nHe \ndid. \n16 \nQ \nAll \nright. \n17 \nA \nHe \n-- so, he supervised the civil, the \ncriminal, \n18 the \nappellate, and the forfeiture. \n19 \nQ All \nright. There is here in this e-mail that you \n20 did not see back in the \nday, Exhibit 9, a pushback from \n21 \nregarding the rush that \nis in to \n22 pursue the case, and he says, \"This \nis obviously a Very \n23 significant case, and Alex wants to \ntake his time making sure \n24 he is \ncomfortable before proceeding.\" Do you -- can \nyou tell \n25 us what the basis would be for, or \nwas, for that assertion by \nEFTA00009307\n\nPage \n\".7.;. \n2 \nA \nSo, I can't \n-- well, I \ncan't \ntell you from \n3 \nrecollection what the basis is. \nI can -- I can speculate \n4 \nthat the materials being \ntransmitted Friday morning -- \noh, I \n5 \nguess it was \n-- yeah, so \n--\n6 \nQ \nThe 11th. \nA Yeah. \nQ \nFriday. \n9 \nA So, Friday \nmorning, it hasn't been \nreviewed by \n10 anyone \nin the management \nchain, much less approved \nand \n11 \nedited, and that Monday \nis saying why don't I have a \n12 \ndecision? \n13 \nAnd -- and so, \nabsent truly extenuating \n14 \ncircumstances, typically, you'd \nhave -- give -- you \nknow, \n15 it'd go \nthrough the management \nchain up to the U.S. \nAttorney. \n16 And so, he's \npushing back, saying, hey, \nit's been a day, or \n17 it's been a \nweekend. I'm --\n18 \nQ \nRight. \n19 \nA -- I'm just \nreading between the lines here. \n20 \nQ Who \nhad authority to sign off on \nthe Epstein \n21 \nprosecution? To, say, \nindict? \n22 \nA So, as a delegated \nmatter, had \n23 \nsignature authority. \n24 Q \nMe \n-hmm. \n25 \nA As did -- as \ndid \n, \nas \ndid \nEFTA00009308\n\nPage 81 \n1 \nobviously I did. As a practice matter, this is \nsomething \n2 that would have gone through the chain, and that we would \n3 have then discussed. \n4 \nQ \nBut why up at your level? Is it because it is, \nas \n5 \nsays, \n\"Obviously a very \nsignificant case?\" \n6 A \nSo, at my level, not only because of \nthe facts, \n7 \nbecause it's not \nabout the facts, but I do think that there \n8 \nare legal issues that -- that implicated policy, that -- that \n9 we were thinking through. \n0 \nQ \nAnd \nwhat were -- what were the legal issues, and \n11 \nwhat were the policy issues? \n12 \nA So -- so, the legal \nissues, and also factual issues \n13 in terms of the \nwitnesses. So, the legal issues so, and \n14 there's an e-mail \nfrom \nbased on the -- you know, the \n5 contemporaneous \nrecord that alludes to some of this. In my \n16 \nexperience at the civil rights division, trafficking cases \n17 involved -- \nyou know, I can -- I can describe some -- some \n1 8 horrific \ncases of girls being held against their will, \nyou \n19 know. \n20 You \nhad child \npornography \nmatters \nwith young \nwomen, \n21 sometimes incredibly young, that the office prosecuted. \nAs \n22 the trafficking laws were being developed, there \nwas a lot o \n23 discussion about, what's the difference \nbetween trafficking \n24 and solicitation, and that discussion took place as the \n25 trafficking laws were being \ndeveloped. And so, this \nEFTA00009309\n\nPage \n82 \n1 \nimplicated \nthat, \nand \nit \nimplicated \nthe \n-- \nwhat \nis \nlocal \nand \n2 \nwhat \nis \nfederal. \n3 \nQ \nAll \nright. \nSo, \nin \nthe \nfirst, \nyou're \ntalking \n-- \nin \n4 \nthe \nfirst \ncategory, \nyou're \ntalking \nabout \nthe \nindividual \n5 \ncharges \nthat \nhad \nbeen \n-- \nthat \nwere \nbeing \nproposed, \nwhich \n6 \nincluded \nboth \ntrafficking \nand \ncoercion \nand \nenticement \n-- \nor, \n7 \nenticement. \n8 \nA \nCorrect. \n9 \nQ \nAll \nright. \nAnd \nin \nthe \nlatter, \nyou \nfelt \nthat \n-- \ndid \n10 \nyou \nto \nwhat \nextent \ndid \nthe \nwitness \n-- \nvictim \nwitness \nkind \n11 \nof \ncredibility \nissues \nimplicate \npolicy? \n12 \nA \nSo \n-- \nso, \nI \nthink \nI \nsaid \npolicy \nand \nvictim \nin \nthat. \n13 \nQ \nAll \nright. \n14 \nA \nIn \nthat \nthere \nwas \ncertainly \ndiscussion \nbetween \nme \n15 \nand \nmy \nmanagement \nabout \nconcerns \nas \nto \nhow \nthese \nvictims \n16 \nwould \nsort \nof \nstand \nup \nin \ncourt. \n17 \nQ \nSo, \nwhat \nwould \nhave \n-- \nwhat \nwould \nmake \nyou \n18 \ncomfortable \nbefore \n-- \nbefore \nproceeding? \nWhat \nwould \nmake \n19 \nyou \n-- \nwhat \nat \nthat \npoint \nwould \nhave \nmade \nyou \ncomfortable \n20 \nabout \nproceeding? \n21 \nA \nSo, \nI \nthink \nthat \nat \nthis \npoint, \nI \ndon't \nthink \nit's \n22 \nwhat \nwould \nor \nwould \nnot \nhave \nmade \nme \ncomfortable, \nand \nI'm \n23 \nspeculating \nhere. \nI \nthink \nit's, \nit \ncame \nin \non \nFriday, \nlet's \n24 \ntalk \nthis \nthrough. \n25 \nQ \nBut \nthere \n-- \nbut \nyou've \njust \nidentified \nfor \nus \nEFTA00009310\n\nPage 83 \n1 \nissues \nthat --\n2 \nA Issues that --\n3\n \n-- in \nyour mind \n4 \nA -- we \nwould have \n--\n5 \nQ \n-- had to be resolved. \n6 \nA -- wanted to talk \nthrough. \n7 \nQ \nAll right. Okay. \nAt that point, did you -- \nto \n8 your \nrecollection, have any doubt \nthat some form of \n9 \nindictment or charging instrument against Epstein was \nlikely \n10 \nto be -- become \nviable? \n11 \nA So, I don't -- it was \na case that I thought \nit very \n12 important that \nwe do something. How that \nsomething played \n13 out, I think \nhad all along been a matter of \ndiscussion. \n14 \nQ As something \nother than what the U.S. \nAttorney's \n15 \nOffice does, which is \nprosecute? \n16 \nA Well -- well, no, I mean, what \nthe U.S. Attorney's \n17 \nOffice does is ensure that justice \nis served. \n18 Q \nRight. \n19 \nA \nAnd \nwhether -- and in partnership \nwith state \n20 attorneys, \nand sometimes that means state \nattorneys take the \n21 lead. Sometimes that \nmeans the U.S. Attorney's Office takes \n22 the lead, and it -- and a \nlot of times, we actually had, you \n23 know, we -- we would \nshare staff, because sometimes \nit made \n24 \nsense for -- you know, for one \npart of the other to take the \n25 \nlead. \nEFTA00009311\n\nPage 84 \n1 So, writ large, \nI thought throughout it was very \n2 important that \nsomething happen. There were these \nconcerns \n3 all along. I \ncan speculate that this is just a reflection of \n4 \nthose continuing concerns. \n5 \nQ \nAs expressed by you \nto in the ordinary \ncourse? \n7 \nA \nAs developed as a group \nthroughout this -- I can \nso, if we go \nback to -- what was the Exhibit? \nQ June of -- June of 2006. \nA So, \nExhibit \n3, \nsays, \"In that \nmeeting, I \nsummarized the \ncase and the state attorney's office \nhandling \n12 \nit.

Early, meaning it proceeds \nthe one --\n22 \nA Correct-. \n23 Q \n-- we just looked at, \nand early in that it's right \n24 \nas \nyou're \n25 \nA \n5 \nEFTA00009312\n\nPage 85 \n1 \nQ -- receiving \nthe pros memo, and you \nask him, have \n2 \nyou read the memo? \nAnd curious why you \n3 \nrather than \n4 \nask MI \nA I don't \nrecall. \nI can \n-- I can speculate, and I \n5 have \ntwo thoughts that I'll \nspeculate. One is, ME her \n6 direct \nsupervisor. \n7 \nQ Mm-hmm. \n8 \n9 \nA \nAnd I might be thinking --\nQ \nSecond \nline supervisor. \n10 \nA Her second line \nsupervisor, so why is sending \n11 \nme \nthis? , have you read \nthis? I.e., did you jump \nthe \n12 \nchain? Secondly, \nI think it \nI may \nhave wanted to \nhave \n13 \nmultiple opinions \non this. \n14 Q \nMs-hmm. \n15 A It's most \nlikely that I had talked to \n16 already, \nbecause and I talked more \noften, and I'm asking \n17 another \nperson in the management chain, hey, \nwhat do you \n18 think? Let's have \nmultiple opinions on the table here. \n19 \nQ Well, this is the \nfirst time other than \nthat \n20 \nwe \nsee you getting a \nrecommendation. \n21 A Right. \n22 Q \nWhen \nsays, he \nthinks that you should \n23 charge \nhim -- you, the office, \nshould charge Epstein. He has \n24 \nissues with \nthe charging strategy proposed by \nbut \n25 one, \nhe says, \"We all need to \nget on the same page as to \nEFTA00009313\n\nPage 86 \n1 whether the \nstatute's covered the conduct, \nand whether the \n2 \nconduct is the type \nwe should charge. I think \nthe answer to \n3 both is yes, \nalthough there is some \nrisk on some of the \n4 \nstatutes.\" He proposes \nthat the office start with a \n5 \ncomplaint, which is \nnot unusual, is it? \n6 \n7 \nA \nIt -- it happens, yes. \nQ \nAll right, which allows \nthe defendant to be \n8 arrested, and \nideally detained, and then \nthe defendant is \n9 \nthen highly motivated \nor incentivized --\n10 \n11 \n12 \nwhat \nA \nOkay. \nQ \n-- to \nwork a pre-indictment \nresolution. That's \nis proposing. \nHe also notes that \nit's \n13 \nimportant to -- in his view, \nto \"cap him with conspiracy \n14 \ncounts to make a plea \nattractive,\" and the court could give \n15 \nus a hard time with that if \nwe had to dismiss indicted \n16 \ncounts. \n17 \nA \nRight. \n18 \nQ \nOkay. The \nproposed indictment included one \n19 conspiracy -- a conspiracy \nthat has a five year \n20 \nA Five year cap. \n21 Q \n-- \nstatutory maximum, and this \nnotion is that \n22 Epstein be \ncharged with a five-year \nconspiracy count, and \n23 take \nit from there. Do you know what \nhe was referring to \n24 when he noted that \na court could give you a hard \ntime in \n25 \ndismissing indicted counts in \nthis case? \nEFTA00009314\n\nPage 87 \n1 A \nSo -- so, as a typical matter, once \nthere's an \n2 indictment, the \n-- a pre-indictment -- well, by \ndefinition, a \n3 pre-indictment resolution comes off \nthe table, but in cases \n4 of this nature, the \nresolutions tend to happen before \n5 \nindictment, because once the indictment is \ndone, at least in \n6 \nSouth Florida, dismissal of charges -- for \nexample, if -- you \n7 \nknow, if \nis saying, let's \nthink about a 371 with a five \n8 year cap a rule 11 --\n9 \nQ \nMm\n-hem. \n10 A -- that's something \nthat South Florida judges, they \n11 tend \nnot to -- you know, dismissing a \nnumber of counts, and \n12 then doing a rule 11 is not \nsomething that judges tend to do. \n13 \nQ \nAll right. Two -- two pieces to that. One is \n--\n14 A \nOkay. \n15 \nQ \n-- the issue of dismissing substantive --\n16 A Right. \n17 \nQ \n-- counts -- substantive counts.
