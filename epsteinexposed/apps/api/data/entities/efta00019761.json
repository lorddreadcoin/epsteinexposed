I called over there to confirm and they said the company has no comment and will not confirm \nanything regarding Epstein. Just wanted you guys to know in the event a subpoena was needed. \nSpecial Agent \nFBI-New York \nChildEx loitation/Human Trafficking Task Force \nDesk: \nCell: \nEFTA00019761",
