Please be advised MCC staff do not have \nbody cameras. \nThank you, \n>>> \nAida \nLeisenring \nHello M, \n7/25/2019 11:54 AM >>> \nIt was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving him extra time to \nreview his discovery. We very much appreciate that. \nI am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell \non the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July \n23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 \nat 4 am is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and \npreserve the relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers \nwere wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that \nsuch footage also be preserved. \nWe will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal \npreservation request. \nThank you. \nAida Ferrer Leisenring, Esq. \nBarket Epstein, Kearon, Aldea & LoTurco LLP \nEFTA00019901\n\nPlease note that my emailed has changed to: \nThis transmittal may be a confidential attorney client communication or may otherwise be privileged or confidential.
