For the fax confirmations, I'm good with you just retaining the record. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSent: Monday, August 19, 2019 11:54 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Subpoenas to Serve \nThey are all sent. Do I need to resave the subpoenas with the OB211 attached in pdf form? I just printed them separately \nand combined them in hard copy form. Also, with the fax confirmations shall I scan them and merge them with the \nsubpoenas with which they were served? \nFrom: (USANYS) < \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 3:55 PM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor) \nSubject: Subpoenas to Serve \nCan you send all of these out? All Epstein related. To each of them can you attach the OB211 form at the end, which I've \nalso attached.
