We will likely reach out to your adversary in the deposition to ask for a  copy, but I wanted to check \nto see whether you had already done so. \nThanks, \nFrom: Jack Scarola \nSent: Wednesday, September 9, 2020 9:53 AM \nTo: \n(USANYS) <M> \nSubject: Fwd: 12/04/09 vs Epstein Deposition Transcript \n> \nThe email exchange below confirms our inability to locate the first volume of deposition. However, attached are \nfairly detailed notes of Paralegal/Investigator who attended the deposition and recorded these notes \ncontemporaneously. appears to have held nothing back, and the notes certainly paint a picture of the kind of \ntroubled young women who were particularly susceptible to Epstein's pattern of recruitment, grooming and \nvictimization. \nSent from my iPad \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Chris R.
