I  think we're just working \nthrough the many phone calls and updates today, but it's thoughtful of you to reach out so thanks very much \nagain. \n Ori inal Messa e \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nalMIE> \nSent: Saturda , Au ust 10 2019 11:11 \nTo: • \nSubject: Epstein \nAll, \nSony to see the sad news about Epstein. I'm sure you're shaken. and I went through a similar \nsuicide three years ago with a securities fraud defendant. If you need anything, we're here for you. You were \ndoing you're job and obviously no one wishes harm to come to anyone. \nEFTA00028540",
