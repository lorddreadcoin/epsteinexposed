RESPONSIBILITIES \nInternal Affairs, Office of (8/4/97) \nSpecial Investigative Supervisors Manual \n(8/1/95) \nOccupational Safety and \nEnvironmental Health \nManual \n(8/16/99) \na. Boards of Inquiry. \nThe Director may appoint Boards of \nInquiry to \ninvestigate appropriate significant incidents in the \nBureau including, but not limited to: \nallegations of significant breaches of policy, or \nany other matter which \nreflects in a significant way \nupon the Bureau's ability to carry out its mission. \nThe General Counsel may request that the Director appoint a \nBoard of \nInquiry to investigate incidents or allegations that are \nlikely to result in \nlitigation against the United States, the \nBureau, or one of its employees. \nb. Regional Inquiry Teams. Regional \nDirectors may appoint \nInquiry Teams to \ninvestigate incidents or allegations of \nsignificant \ndeparture from policy or regulation within their \njurisdictions, or in any other instance when it would be in the \nBureau's best interest. An exception is a matter which is to be \ninvestigated by a Board or Team appointed at a higher \nlevel. \nRegional Counsel may request that the Regional Director appoint \nan Inquiry Team to \ninvestigate incidents or allegations that are \nlikely to result in \nlitigation against a Bureau institution or \nemployee under regional \njurisdiction. \nc. Local Inquiry Teams. Wardens, with the approval of the \nRegional Director, \nmay appoint a local Inquiry Team to \ninvestigate incidents or allegations of significant departure \nfrom policy or \nregulation at only that institution. For more \nroutine incidents \nrequiring investigation, the Warden may not \nappoint \nan Inquiry Team, but should assign staff such as an \nAssociate Warden, appropriate department head, or investigative \nofficer to investigate routine matters. \n7. APPOINTMENT OF \nBOARDS AND TEAMS. The Director, \nRegional \nDirector, or Warden will notify in writing each \nperson appointed \nto serve as a member of the Board or Team as to: \nEFTA00028725\n\nPS 1210.21 \n3/9/2000 \nPage 4 \n#  the purpose and \nscope of the inquiry, \n#  the date the inquiry is to begin, and \n#  if appropriate, the date that a completed report is to be \nfurnished to \nthe appointing official. \nThe written notification will indicate which member is \nto chair \nthe Board or \nTeam. \nThe General Counsel or Regional Counsel will be consulted prior \nto the creation of a Board or Team to determine \nwhether the \nappropriate legal office should initiate a request that a Board \nor Team be appointed. Boards and Teams appointed at the request \nof the General Counsel or Regional Counsel will include at least \none legal staff \nmember. \na. \nBoards of Inquiry.

The \nOIA will pay all expenses \nincidental and necessary to the work of a \nBoard of Inquiry. \nb. Regional Inquiry Teams. To ensure \nobjectivity, a regional \nInquiry \nTeam should not consist of staff from only one \ninstitution. The Team must be composed of personnel at the \ndepartment head level or above from any \ninstitution, any regional \noffice, or the Central \nOffice. The regional office will bear all \nexpenses incurred (such as for travel). \nc. Local Teams.

Members must visit the scene of an incident, reconstruct \nthe chain of events, and record their observations by notes, \nphotographs, audio or visual recordings, or other appropriate \nmeans. \nd. If, at any \npoint during the inquiry, it becomes apparent \nthat serious criminal or administrative misconduct is \ninvolved, \nOIA will be consulted to determine whether a referral to the \nOffice of the \nInspector General or Civil Rights Division is \nappropriate. If an OIA representative is not present, members \nwill contact \nthe Chief, OIA, for advice before proceeding \nfurther. \ne. Members must interview witnesses or other \npersons having \nknowledge of the \nincident, using the following procedures: \n(1) Advise any person \nbeing interviewed of the purpose of \nthe interview, including the nature of the inquiry, and fully \nidentify all members present. An \nindividual's right to \nrepresentation, if any, must be determined prior to the \ninterview. For bargaining unit \nmembers, union representational \nrights will apply (see Employee \nRights Article of Master \nAgreement). \nDuring the inquiry, witnesses or \nother persons having \nknowledge of the incident must be instructed to keep all \ninformation strictly \nconfidential and instructed not to disclose \nany information concerning the nature \nof the inquiry or the \ninformation he or \nshe has provided to anyone other than the Board \nor Team, or to an appropriate union representative. \n(2) If the inquiry develops \ninformation which focuses on \nthe person being questioned, or about to be questioned, as a \nsuspect in possible criminal misconduct, questioning of that \nperson may not proceed until the local U.S. Attorney: \n# declines prosecution, \n# grants use \nimmunity, or \n# recommends the interviewee be advised of his or \nher \nMiranda \nRights. \nOne of these conditions must be satisfied before questioning \na person suspected of possible criminal misconduct. These \ncontacts with the local U.S. Attorney will be coordinated through \nOIA. \nEFTA00028727\n\nPS 1210.21 \n3/9/2000 \nPage 6 \nc. Members must visit the scene of an incident, reconstruct \nstatement. The witness will be permitted a reasonable \nopportunity to prepare and review the statement before swearing \nor affirming the truth of \nthe statement. The Chair and members \nwill have authority \nto administer oaths or affirmations to \nwitnesses in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 303. \n# For a written \nstatement. \n\"I hereby declare (or certify, verify, or state) under \npenalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect.\" \n# For an oral statement: \n\"I swear (or affirm) under penalty of perjury that the \nstatement I am about to make is true and correct.\" \n(4) All \nemployees may be required by Boards of Inquiry, \nRegional Inquiry Teams, and \nlocal Inquiry Teams to answer \nquestions regarding their employment, even \nthough their answers \nmay lead to disciplinary action up to and \nincluding removal; \nhowever, in criminal \ncases, employees retain their constitutional \nrights regarding avoidance of \nself-incrimination and may not be \ndisciplined for properly \nexercising these rights. \n(5) Any visual or oral \nrecordings made of interviews and \nother proceedings will be preserved to allow a reasonable \nopportunity for the resolution of any \nadministrative review or \nappeal related to the \ninquiry. \n9. \nREPORTS \na.

The completed report, along with all working \nnotes and other personal records created by members as a result \nof the inquiry, will \nbe submitted to the official who appointed \nthe Board or Team, unless the appointing official had done so at \nthe request of the General Counsel or Regional Counsel. \nIf the \nBoard or Team was appointed at the request of the General Counsel \nor Regional Counsel, the completed report will be submitted \ndirectly to the requesting Counsel. \nEFTA00028728\n\nPS 1210.21 \n3/9/2000 \nPage 7 \nIf a report is submitted to an appointing \nofficial (rather than \nto a requesting Counsel), three copies of the report \nwill be \nsubmitted through OIA \nfor filing in the Director's Office, in the \nOffice of General \nCounsel, and in OIA. \nc. Release of Findings or Reports. Findings or reports of \nall \nBoards of Inquiry or Inquiry Teams will be released \nonly upon the \nDirector's authorization in consultation with the General \nCounsel. A Board of Inquiry report may be required to be \nproduced in connection with \ncivil or criminal proceedings or a \nFOIA \nrequest. A Board of Inquiry report may also be released in \nconnection with a \nCongressional inquiry. \nIf a subpoena or request for discovery is received \nin \nconnection with any civil or \ncriminal proceeding that demands, or \nreasonably could be construed as to demand, the production of a \nBoard of Inquiry \nreport, and/or \nany \nworking notes or \npersonal \nrecords created by members as a result of an \ninquiry, the \nsubpoena should be forwarded to the Regional Counsel who, after \nconsultation with the General Counsel and the Director, as \nnecessary, will coordinate the production of the documents or \nassertion of any evidentiary privilege as \nappropriate with the \nlocal U.S. Attorney's Office. \nFindings or reports from Boards of Inquiry or Inquiry Teams \nappointed at the request of the General Counsel or a Regional \nCounsel prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial are to be \nreviewed by the General Counsel before any release, since these \ndocuments may be privileged documents protected from disclosure \nby the attorney work-product privilege. \nThe General Counsel will \nmake the determination of whether to assert this \nprivilege. \n/s/ \nKathleen Hawk Sawyer \nDirector \nEFTA00028729",
