The Court is \nfamiliar with me from \nmy previous \ndeclaration in this case. I  am \ncurrently \n31 years old and \nwant to become a  part \nof the case to enforce \nmy rights and \npossibly allow \ncriminal prosecution ofleffrey Epstein and others who abused \nunderage girls. \n2. \nI  have seen a  Government filing \nsaying that I  waited too long before trying \nto become a \npart of this case. I  don't \nthink that the \nGovernment's \nposition tells the full story \nabout me. In \nfact, \nI  believe tlx: \nGovernment is hiding \nsome of the things that \nit knows about \nme and about \nother \npowerful people involved in this case. I  am filing \nthis declaration so \nthat the Court will \nhave more facts to make \nthe decision about whether to \nlet me come into the \ncase. \n3. In its \nlatest filing, \nthe Government \nseems to be \nquestioning \nwhy I  was \nafraid and \ndid not \ncome forward to  speak more quickly. To understand my reasons, it is important that I  share at \nleast some additional information \nabout why I  was \nso fearful \nafter my abuse by Epstein and \nothers. \n4. \nThe Court can best understand my situation by \nlooking at \nmy \nprevious declaration and \nthen understanding why I  was afraid of Epstein, how I eventually escaped from him, \nand how I \nwas \nforced to \nhide from \nhim and others. \n5. I  first met Epstein when I  was 15 \nyears \nold. I  have told the Court about some of my \nsexual and physical abuse in my \nearlier declaration. \n6. \nAs a result of that abuse \nand my \nconsiderable \ninteractions with \nEpstein and his friends, I \nknew \nthat Epstein was \nconnected to some of the \nmost powerful people in \nthe world, \nincluding a \nmember of the \nBritish Royal family, a  former President of the United States, and other very \npowerful lawyers, politicians and businessmen. I  was afraid of what would happen if I  tried to \nescape from Epstein or report him \nto law enforcement. \nEFTA00020730\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 11/23/2015 \nPage 3 of 28 \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 310-1 Entered on \nFLSD Docket \n02/06/2015 Page 3 of 28 \n13. Part of my fear comes \nfrom physical abuse that I  suffered when Epstein \nforced me to \nhave sex with other people. Without going into the details of \nthe sexual activities I was forced to \nendure, there were times when \nI \nwas physically abused to the point that I  remember \nfearfully \nthinking that I didn't know whether I  was going to survive. \n14. Jeffrey Epstein knew \nabout this physical and \nsexual abuse \nbecause \nI \nwould detail it  for \nhim as part of my debriefing. Epstein didn't care. Epstein said things like, \n\"You get that \nsometimes.\" I  told him how much I \nhated having to be with some people, but Epstein still sent \nme \nback. I  had no choice. \n15. 1 give the Court this information so \nthat it  can better understand why I  was so afraid of \nEpstein and what he \ncould do to me. I could provide more details to the Court, if \nthe Court needs \nmore details on this issue. I also wanted to \nprovide this information to the Court because I  have \nbeen \naccused of being a  \"serial prostitute.\" I  don't think that is a  fair way to \ndescribe my \nsituation, given that I was so young and \nso many powerful people were forcibly abusing me. \n2 \nEFTA00020731\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n11/23/2015 Page 4 of \n28 \nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 310-1 Entered on \nFLSD Docket 02/06/2015 Page 4 of \n28 \n17. After years of abuse and being lent out, I \nbegan to look for a  way to escape. I \nhad \nbeen \nfirst forced into \nall this because I  wanted to be a \nmassage therapist. Epstein \nhad taken me into \nhis clutches through promises and talk. But once he had \nme under his control, I  felt trapped. \n18. I  kept asking Epstein for my \npromised training and education. Epstein finally got me a \nplane \nticket to  Thailand to go to Chaing Mai to learn Thai massage. This sounded \nlike my \nchance to escape. In September 2002, I packed my \nbags for good. I knew this would be my only \nopportunity \nto break away from Epstein. \n19. On September 27, \n2002, I  flew from MK in New York to Chaing \nMai, Thailand. I \narrived around September 29 for my training. \nBut Epstein was going to get something out of this \nas well. \nI \nwas supposed to interview a girl to bring back to the United States for Epstein. \n20. Exhibit I  is a  list of room charges in \nThailand, with the charges going to Epstein's \naccount. This exhibit shows Epstein's telephone numbers and is \nevidence that he paid for my \nhotel in Thailand. \n21. \nExhibit 2  is a set of documents showing \nmy itinerary and flight plans for me going \nto \nThailand, paid for by \nEpstein. \n22. I \ndid the massage training in Chiang Mai. I  met a  truly great and special guy \nand told him \nhonestly \nwhat I \nwas \nbeing \nforced to do. He \ntold at \nI \nshould \nget out \nof it. I  told him that the \npeople I  was working for were very powerful and that I  could \nnot disobey them without risking \nmy life. He told \nme he would \nprotect me, \nand I  had \nconfidence in him. I \nsaw my opportunity to \nescape and to be with someone who truly loved me and \nwould protect me. To make a long story \nshort, I married him and flew to Australia. \n23. I  called \nEpstein and told him I  was not coming back. Ile asked why? I \nsaid \"I've fallen \nin love.\" And Epstein basically just said \"good \nluck and have a  good life.\" I could tell he was \nnot happy. I  was very afraid of what he was \ngoing to do to \nme. I \nthought Epstein or one of his \npowerful friends \nmight send someone to have me killed. \n24. \nI \nstayed in Australia from that \npoint on, with my husband and away from the life I  had \nbeen forced to live as Epstein's sex slave. I was in Australia from late 2002 to October \n2013. To \nbe clear, I  was \nnever \nin the \nUnited \nStates during these years, \nnot even \nfor a \nshort \ntrip to \nvisit my \nmother. \nAnd my absence from the United States was \nnot voluntary —  I  was hiding from Epstein \nout of \nfear of what he \nwould \ndo to me if I returned \nto \nthe United \nStates. \n3 \nEFTA00020732\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n11/23/2015 Page 5 of \n28 \nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2015 \nPage 5 of 28 \n25. \nIn around 2007, after not hearing from \nanyone for years, out of the blue I  was \ncontacted \nby someone who identified \nhimself with a  plain sounding \nname and claimed lie was with the \nFBI. It seemed very odd for someone doing an \nofficial criminal investigation to just call up on \nthe phone like that. I  hadn't \nheard Epstein's name for years. I  didn't know who this \nperson was \nand what it was really about. I  wasn't sure what was going on. \n26. This man said he \nwas looking into Jeffrey Epstein. The \nman asked if I  had been involved \nwith Epstein. My first instinct was to say \nnothing; because I  wasn't sure he was really with \nthe \nFBI or any \nauthorities. I  did answer a  few basic questions, telling him \nthat I  knew Jeffrey \nEpstein and met him at a  young age. The whole \nconversation didn't feel like it was right. This \nrum never offered \nto come and meet with me in person. He instead asked \nme right off the bat \nabout Epstein's sexual practices. I  thought it would \nbe strange for a real law enforcement officer \nto behave that way. \n1 became increasingly uncomfortable and suspicious about \nwho was actually \ncalling me. \n27. The way the conversation was going \nmade me doubt whether I  was really talking to \nan \nFBI \nagent. \nIt \ndid not seem very official. I  became very uncomfortable, so I \ntold him nothing \nmore about Epstein. The conversation probably didn't \neven last three minutes. The conversation \nimmediately \ntriggered all of the fears of Epstein and his powerful \nfriends that had caused me to \nescape the first time. \nIf the call accomplished anything, it only \nput me back in \nfear and told me \nthat I could be found quite easily and had nobody official \nprotecting me. \n28. I  suspected \nthat the \nman who \ncalled me was \nworking for Epstein or \none \nof \nEpstein's \npowerful fr\niends. If the man who called me was really an FBI agent and \nwas interested in what I \nknew about Epstein, I thought he would have made \nsome effort to see me personally. I believed \nthat if this was \nreally an agent who was investigating Epstein, then he knew \nwho 1 was and how I \nfit into Epstein's sexual crimes in many \ndifferent places. Such an agent would send someone to \nmeet me \nin person (who could provide potential protection from Epstein). lie never did. \n29. Getting a call from this supposed FBI Agent made me very \nscared. I  had left that old life \nbehind \nme \nand started a  new life in \na  new country in hopes that the powerful people whose \nillegal activities I  knew all about would never find me. And now \n1 had been tracked down by \nsomeone and was frightened. \n30. Shortly after \nthis purported FBI call, I  was contacted by someone who \nwas clearly \nworking for Epstein. This person discussed an investigation \ninto Epstein, and said that some of \nthe girls \nwere saying Epstein had sexual contact with them. After they made those allegations, \nthey were being discredited as drug addicts and \nprostitutes. But, on the other hand, if I  were to \nkeep quiet, I \nwould \"be looked after.\" The fact that this call came in right \nafter the FBI call \nreinforced my concern that the man I had talked to \nearlier was not really working for the FBI, but \nwas really \nworking for Epstein. I  didn't think \nthat \nthe FBI and Epstein would \nboth be working \ntogether \nand \nwould \nboth get my phone \nnumber \nat almost \nexactly the \nsame time. I played along \nand told \nthis person that I  had gotten a call from the \"FBI\" but that I \ndidn't tell them anything. \nThe person was pleased with that. \n4 \nEFTA00020733\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n11/23/2015 Page 6 of 28 \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered on FLSD \nDocket 02106/2015 Page 6 of 28 \n31. A short time later, one of \nEpstein lawyers (not Alan \nDershowitz) called me, and then got \nEpstein on the \nline at the same time. Epstein and \nhis lawyer basically asked again if I \nwas going \nto say \nanything. The clear implication \nwas that I should not say \nanything. The way they \nwere \napproaching me, I was afraid \nof what would happen if I \ndidn't keep \nquiet \nMy thought was that if \nI didn't say the right things, I might \nget hurt. \n32. I \npromised Epstein and his lawyer \nthat I would keep quiet. They \nseemed happy with that \nand that seemed to me the \nway to most likely keep me \nand my family safe. And I \ndid what \nEpstein and his lawyer told \nme— \nI kept quiet. \n33. 1  now \nunderstand that Epstein reached a \nnon-prosecution agreement \nwith the federal \ngovernment \nin 2007 and pled guilty \nto two state crimes in June 2008. \nNo one told me anything \nabout those events \nuntil much later. \nIn fact, nobody called \nor came to see me to \nexplain \nwhat a \nnon\n-prosecution agreement was, \nwhat crimes Epstein could have \nbeen charged with, why he was \nnot being \ncharged with the crimes he committed, \nor anything whatsoever about the \ncase. I  was \nnever offered a chance to \nmeaningfully confer with the prosecutor for \nthe Government, and I was \nnever \nnotified of any hearing \nthat \ncould affect me \nor my rights \nas a crime victim to \never \nbring \ncharges. \n34. On September 3, 2008, \nthe FBI sent a victim \nnotification letter to me. This was the fi\nrst \nwritten communication I  had \nreceived from the FBL The letter \nwas attached as Exhibit 1  to my \nearlier statement \nThis kind of written \ncommunication, on official FBI stationary, is \nthe way that \nI thought the FBI really \ncommunicated with people that they \nwanted to talk to. The fact that I got \nthis official \nletter from them made me wonder \neven more whether that the call \nI  had received \nearlier was really from the FBI. \nThe letter that I got did not \nmention that anyone from the FBI \nbad \never called me before. \n35. The \nletter started off with the \nsentence: \"By virtue of this letter, the \nUnited States \nAttorney's \nOffice for the \nSouthern \nDistrict of Florida \nprovides you \nwith the \nfollowing notice \nbecause you are \nan identified victim of a federal \noffense.\" That sentence (among \nothers) made it \nseem like this was the \nfirst time the FBI was officially \ncontacting me. That was the first time I \nwas told about my rights as a crime \n36. I  did \nnot know what was happening \nabout any criminal prosecution of \nEpstein at this \ntime. I wanted him \nprosecuted. And given his \nconstant illegal \nsexual \nbehavior, I  thought it was \nobvious \nthat he should be \nprosecuted. But \nafter reading the \nletter, I was \nconfused. The \nletter did \nnot explain \nwhat was actually happening or what \nrole, if any, that I could play. In fact, the \nletter \nthanked me for my assistance \nduring the investigations, yet it wasn't \nclear what that was \nreferring to. \n37. \nAlso, the letter did not directly say that \nEpstein's crimes against me were not \ngoing to be \nprosecuted. It just said that \"the \nUnited States has agreed to defer \nfederal prosecution in favor of \nthis state plea and sentence .\n. . .\" I did not know \nwhat that \nmeant. The letter did not \ninform me \nhow it applied to me. The \nletter also said that there was \n\"litigation between the United States \nand two other victims regarding the \ndisclosure of the entire agreement between the \nUnited States \nand Mr. Epstein.\" \nUnderstanding more about that case \nnow, I  realize that the letter did not \n5 \nEFTA00020734\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 341-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/23/2015 Page 7 of 28 \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered on \nFLSD Docket \n02/06/2015 Page 7 of \n28 \nexplain \nthat the real \npurpose of that litigation \nwas not to  get \n\"disclosure of the \nentire agreement\" \nbut instead to \nget criminal charges \nfiled against \nEpstein and to  uphold \nthe rights of \nEpstein's \nvictims. I wish that the \nGovernment had told \nme that was what was \nreally going on. \n38. I saw \non the letter that I \ncould call a \nlawyer. The letter also \nmentioned Jack \nGoldberger, \nwho \n1 knew to be \nEpstein's attorney, \nwhich scared me. I \nfirst got in touch with \nthe attorneys at \nthe Podhurst \nOrseck firm. My \nlawyers filed a \nlawsuit against Epstein \nfor me, which \nmentioned \nthat I  was abused \nby Epstein and other \npowerful people. I \nwas hoping that the \ninformation I \ngave as part \nof my lawsuit might \nhelp to put Epstein \naway in prison -- \nwhere he belongs. But \nthe \nlawsuit ended up just \nbeing about money, which \nEpstein paid to settle. \n40. At this point, \nsince nothing else \nseemed to be working \nto get Epstein and \nhis associates \nheld \naccountable, I  wanted to \ntry by myself to get \na  message out to the \npublic about what \nterrible \nthings Epstein and his \nfriends had done to \nme and other girls. I \nwas very disturbed \nabout how no \none was \nprosecuting Epstein \nfor these crimes. I \nwas also very \nscared. It  seemed \nthat law \nenforcement was not doing \nanything with the information \nthey knew about me, which \nleft \nme \nand my family more \nvulnerable and scared. \n41. The \njournalist printed an \narticle using some \nof the information I \ntold her. Shortly \nafter \nthe \narticle was \npublished, I  talked on the \nphone to Marie \nVillafafta, a  federal \nprosecutor from \nFlorida. 1 \nhad seen her name on \nthe official letter \nfrom the FBI, so she \nseemed legitimate. \nVillafafta seemed \nvery interested in my case \nand seemed like she \nreally wanted to do \nsomething. \n42. \nWithin a few \nweeks of the newspaper \narticle being \npublished, two FBI agents \nalso called \nme \nin Australia and then \ncame to meet me. In \naround March 2011, they \nmet we at the U.S. \nConsulate in \nSidney. They seemed to be \nvery professional and \nhard working. I \nthought to myself \nthat I \nhad finally gotten the \nattention of the people \nthat I  wanted to and \nthat these people \nwould \ndo the \nright things against \nEpstein and the other \ncriminals. I also thought that \nthey could protect \nme. \n43. \nWhen I  met with \nthe agents, they \nmainly focused on \nEpstein. But while there, I \nprovided \nthem some \ninformation about \nsome of the others who \nwere involved in \nillegal acts as well. I  was \naware that a  false \nstatement to  these law \nenforcement officers \nwas a crime and I  told \nthe truth—\ngiving \nthem \nthe information that \nI  could recall at the \ntime about the \nindividuals they inquired \nabout. \n44. \nTlx agents were clearly \nprepared to meet me and \nalready knew a  lot about \nEpstein's \ncrimes. \nThe agents appeared \nto be very good at \ninvestigating and \nseemed like they really \nknew \nhow to piece \ntogether the whole story. \nBut at  the same \ntime, they seemed like \nthey were being \nblocked from doing \nwhat they wanted to do — \nwhich I  thought was to \narrest Epstein and his \npowerful friends for all of their illegal sexual crimes. \n6 \nEFTA00020735\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 11123/2015 \nPage 8 of 28 \nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 310-1 \nEntered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2015 Page 8 \nof 28 \n45. \nDuring my interview with the real FBI agents, I \ntold them about my contact from the \npurported FBI agent. They did not tell \nme that it had been a legitimate call from the FBI. \n46. The interview I  did with these FBI \nagents was very stressful for me. My \nmeeting \nlasted \nfor several hours. It \nwas not easy to  talk about all these difficult things, \nbut I  went through it. I \nwas crying at points in the interview. The \ninterview also placed stress on my marriage, because \nmy \nhusband had to listen to all the terrible things that happened to me. It was difficult \n%r me to \nhave to discuss being passed around as a sex object \namong powerful people. It was very hard for \nboth \nof us. \n47. The agents had come from \nFlorida to meet with me in Australia and took my information \nwhich gave me reason to believe that Epstein could still be \nprosecuted for the crimes he \ncommitted against me. I  was not told \neven at that point that he could not be prosecuted \nfor the \ncrimes he \ncommitted in Florida. I  was not told about the CVRA \ncase or that there was any other \noption for \nme to enforce my \nrights. In fact, by the \nagents meeting with me \nI believed I  was doing \nexactly what I needed to do to enforce my rights and assist in the prosecution. \n48. \nI  have seen the Government's recent brief trying to \nkeep me from joining this case. In \nthat brief, the Government says about me \"the Government is aware that petitioners' counsel \nhave been representing her [that is, me] since \nat least as early as March 2011.\" This is \ncompletely untrue, and I \nthink the Government knows it is untrue. I was not \nrepresented by legal \ncounsel in \nMarch 2011. \nThe Government has to know that I  didn't \nhave an attorney then, \nbecause I didn't have an \nattorney \nwhen I  met the agents in Sydney. I don't \nunderstand why the \nGovernment is giving false facts to the court. \n50. In around April 2011, as a \nfollow-up to my earlier call with Brad Edwards, I  got a \ntelephone call from him and another attorney, Jack \nScarola. They just wanted general \ninformation about whether various people had information relevant to the lawsuit. They told me \nthat they were taping the conversation, and \nI  had no \nproblem with that. I \ncooperated \nwith them \nand \ngave them \ninformation about which people \nhad \ninformation relevant about \nEpstein's \ncrimes. \nBecause it was over the phone and we did not \nknow each other very well, they were very polite \nand did not ask me a \nlot of details about \nspecifically who I  had sex \nwith and what sexual \nactivities I  was forced to participate in. It was a general, background \ninterview. \n51. As \nthe months \nfollowing the FBI \nmeeting in Sydney passed, I  was \ntrying to be patient but \nI  began wondering what was going on about \nprosecuting Epstein. I  continued to be very \nconfused about what was happening. I  was hoping that some kind of prosecution \nwould come \nout of it. \nBut when \nnothing came of \nit, I  got very \nupset. I  wanted to do \nsomething to stop \nEpstein and \nthe other people he associates with from sexually abusing girls. Law enforcement \n7 \nEFTA00020736\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 341-3 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket \n11/23/2015 Page \n9 of 28 \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered on FLSD Docket \n02/06/2015 \nPage 9 of 28 \nhad taken my detailed statements, \nbut nothing seemed to be happening. I \nwasn't sure what to do. \nWhile I  wanted to do all that I could to  get justice for \nwhat had happened \nto me, it was very hard \nfor me to figure out how to get \nsomething done in the United States while I  was living \nin a \nforeign \ncountry; especially after I  had already gave information to \nthe FBI that I  believed they \nwere using to investigate and eventually arrest Epstein. \n52. \nIn October 2013, I  returned to the United \nStates for the first time since I  had left for \nThailand. \n53. In April 2014, I  decided \nto get back in touch with the FBI. In Sydney, the \nFBI had \nseemed like they wanted to be helpful to me, and I have \ngreat respect for the FBI agents who met \nme. It appeared to me they wanted to \ndo the right thing in this case. But my feeling was once \nthe agents \ncollected information about crimes committed \nagainst me, someone else stepped in \nand blocked them from getting charges fi\nled. I  also thought that Marie Villafafta \nreally wanted \nto do the \nright thing and \nhold \nEpstein \naccountable for the horrible \ncrimes he \ncommitted. But, it \nseemed like the hands of \nVillafafia \nand the FBI were always tied by someone \nelse with more \nauthority. \n54. \nI have \nnever \nbeen able to figure \nout who was (and still is) stopping a \nprosecution. I  also \nhaven't \nbeen able to  figure \nout who is trying \nto stop me \nfrom being able \nto participate in a court \ncase to a  have a judge determine \nwhether my rights have been violated. It doesn't seem fair \nto \nme that the Government can argue that \n1 \ndon't even get \nthe opportunity for a judge review the \nissue. To \nne, this is \nthither \nverification of Epstein's power, \nwhich continues \nto make me very \nscared. \n55. I \nhave asked the FBI to show me the video surveillance \nand other pictures of me that I \nbelieve they have in their \npossession. \nThey \nsaid that I  would \nhave to go to the \npmsecutors to get \nthem. But the prosecutors will not share anything with me. I  believe \nthat the prosecutors have \nlots of \ninformation that \nwill \nsupport what I have been saying about \nEpstein \nand \nhis associates. \n56. Based on my \nknowledge of Epstein and his organization, as well as discussions with the \nFBI, it is my belief that federal prosecutors likely possess videotapes and \nphotographic images of \nme as an underage \ngirl \nhaving \nsex with \nEpstein and some of his \npowerful friends. I \ndon't \nunderstand \nwhy they aren't moving forward \nwith what the \nFBI has given \nto them. I also \ndon't \nunderstand why these pictures haven't been given to me nor why law \nenforcement officers from \nany other jurisdictions have never contacted me. \n57. \nIt was \nnot until 2014 that I  first understood about \nthe \nway in \nwhich Jane Doe \nNo. 1 and \nJane Doe No. 2 were trying \nto \ninvalidate the \nnon-prosecution \nagreement to allow \nprosecution of \nEpstein for crimes he committed against them, and me. \nI  had never really heard anything \nsignificant about this case while I  was in Australia, and it was hard to \nget information about what \nwas \nhappening in Florida while I was overseas. \nOnce I \nheard \nabout the case, I \nquickly wanted to \nbecome a part of it. \n58. \nIn light of the way everything has played out, I \nbelieve that my rights as a  crime victim \nhave been \nviolated. It was never my choice \nto become the victim of \ncrimes by Epstein and the \n8 \nEFTA00020737\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 341-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/23/2015 Page 10 of \n28 \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered on \nFLSD Docket \n02/06/2015 Page \n10 of \n28 \npeople \nhe forced me to \nhave sex with. \nEpstein dragged \nme into his web \nwhen I  was very \nyoung \nand, after that, \nit was hard for me \nto escape. After I \nran away to \nAustralia, it appears that \nEpstein \nreached \nan agreement in \n2007 with the \nfederal prosecutors in \nFlorida blocking \nhim from being \nprosecuted for the \ncrimes he committed \nagainst me. \n59. \nWhen Epstein \npled guilty to two \nlow level \ncrimes in 2008 as \npart of his \nagreement, no \none told \nme what was \nhappening or that this \nplea had anything to \ndo with preventing \nprosecution \nof \ncrimes against me or \nthe hundreds of \nother girls he abused. \nNobody told me \nthat I could speak \nto the Judge or \nthat a hearing was \neven taking place. \n60. Based \non all the facts I \nhave described \nhere, I  believe some \nkind of major \ncover-up is \ngoing on \nto protect Epstein \nAs I look back \non what Epstein \nand his friends have \ndone, I see a lot \nof powerful \npeople who knew \nwhat they were \ndoing to  me and \nother girls was \nwrong. But they \nalso \nseemed to  think \nthat they were above \nthe law and they \nhad nothing to \nworry about \nFrom \nwhat I can \nsee, that turned out to \nbe true. There are \nless powerful \npeople -- like the FBI \nagents \nand \nMarie Villafafta — \nthat seem like they \nare trying to get \nthe right thing \ndone. But nothing \nhappens. \n61. \nBecause nothing is \nbeing done, it makes \nme think that \nEpstein was right when \nhe told me \nhe \nhad so many \npeople in his pocket. \nMaybe those \npeople are still helping \nhim escape being \nprosecuted for what \nhe did against \nme. The justice \nsystem doesn't seem \nto respond to \nthe \nvictims in this case. It seems to favor \nthose who \nhave the most money \nand \npower and \ninfluence. \n62. I am \nalso worried that \nthis is a very \ndangerous circuit. By \nstanding up for \nwhat is right, \nI'm \nworried that \nEpstein, or others \nnamed here, will come \nafter me. I \nwonder where this is \ngoing \nto  go if the \nUnited States \ngovernment is not on my \nside. I  am intent \non seeing this \nthrough so \nthat \nEpstein isn't \nallowed to hurt other \nyoung girls. I  can't \nstop abuse \neverywhere in the world. \nBut if I help \none victim then I \nhave made a positive \ndifference. \n63. In \nApril 2014, I  asked \ntwo good \nattorneys —  Brad Edwards \nand Paul Cassell \n—  to  see if \nthey \ncould help me \nbring Epstein and \nhis friends to \njustice. They agreed \nto add me to \nthe \nexisting case. They \nexplained to me that the \nlawsuit was not \nasking to get money from \nEpstein \nor others. I \nunderstand and have \nalways understood \nthat the goal of the \ncase is to simply \nenforce \nmy rights as a crime \nvictim— rights that were \nwrongly taken from me. \n64. \nI  want Epstein \nand the others who \ncommitted crimes \nagainst me to be \npunished fairly \n—\nthe \nway \nother less powerful \nwould be. I  also want \nto be added to the \nsuit filed by the two \ngirls, \nJane \nDoe Number I  and \nJane Doe Number \n2, and I  want to \nhave rights the way \na victim of a less \nwealthy \nand powerful criminal \nwould have. \n65. \nEpstein and his friends \nsexually and \nphysically abused many \nother girls. They \ndid this in \nmany places \naround the world. I \npersonally observed \nthis. There are also \nmany people who \ncould \nconfirm what I am \nsaying. I hope that \nthese people will \ncome forward and \ntell the truth. I \nhope that they \nwill call my \nattorney in Fort \nLauderdale, Florida —  Brad \nEdwards —  so that \nall \nofthe \ninformation can be \npresented to the court \nabout what has \nhappened to me and \nothers. \n9 \nEFTA00020738\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 341-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/23/2015 Page 11 of \nI \nLa \nCase \n9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document \n310-1 Entered \non FLSD \nDocket 02/06/2015 \nPage 11 of \nI \n28 \n66. Because of how often Epstein \nand others were having sex with young girls, and how \nmuch it was a centerpiece of their lives, I doubt they have just stopped. It also seems to me that, \nwhen I  knew them, they \nbelieved that they were above the law —  too powerful to be prosecuted. \nThat \nfeeling has no doubt been reinforced by the fact Epstein has escaped real punishment with \nhis plea bargain, and the others with whom he traveled have completely escaped. I  hope that 1 \ncan \njoin this case and \ntry to bring \nthem to \njustice. \n67.
