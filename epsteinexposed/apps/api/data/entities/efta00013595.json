I  believe that we \nhave \nconsiderable common ground. At the same time, however, it \nappears to me that a few areas \nof potential disagreement are arising. In view of \nthat, and to avoid any misunderstandings, I \nthought it might be useful \nto send a  short letter outlining several requests \nand issues for \nresolution before I send \nyou back my proposed stipulated facts. \n1. \nI  am working with two other attorneys on this case —  Jay Howell \nin Jacksonville, \nFlorida, and Professor Paul \nCassell in Salt Lake City, Utah. Because they were not in court for \nthe \nhearing last Friday, they will need to review a transcript of the hearing before our legal \nteam \ncan agree to any stipulated \nfacts. 1 have requested a  transcript, but the preparation of \nit  will \napparently take several weeks. Do you have any way of expediting the preparation of the \ntranscript by requesting it yourself? Also, as you know, my clients are indigent. As part of the \nGovernment's responsibility to use its \"best efforts to see that crime victims are . accorded() \nthe rights\" in the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § \n3771(c)(1), I  was wondering whether the \nGovernment \nwould be willing to pay for the \ntranscript. \n2. Your \nproposed \nstipulation \nindicates that in September 2007 the U.S. \nAttorney's \nOffice reached an agreement with Epstein to resolve the case, which \nwas then modified in \nOctober and December of that year. While \nthis seems plausible, to stipulate to the facts, \nI  would \nobviously need to \nsee copies of those three agreements. Moreover, because the \ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe initial agreement and its later modification are \nnow the subject of litigation, my \nclient is entitled to see them. See 18 U.S.C. § \n3771(aX8) (victim's right to \"be treated with \nfairness\"). In addition, \nyour proposed stipulation states that: \"On \nJuly 9, 2008, AUSA \nsent \na victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her \nattorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as \nExhibit 6 to the \nDeclaration. That \nnotification contains a written explanation of the full \nterms of the \nagreement between Epstein and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office.\" I  am puzzled by this \nproposed \nstipulation, as your July 9 letter \nexplicitly noted that it was \ncovering only some of the \nprovisions in the \nagreement. Perhaps the fact that I  have not \nyet received the agreement is all \njust an oversight on \nyour part, and you had \nintended to \ngive \nme the \"full \nterms\" of the plea \nagreement \nthat was \nultimately \nreached. In any \nevent, the simplest way \nto proceed at this point is \nfor the plea \nagreement —  and the earlier versions \n-- to be provided to me so that I \ncan review \n2028 \nHARRISON \nSTREET,SUITE 202, \nHOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA \n33020 \nOFFICE: \nMIMMIMMIMMIMMIMMIoil \nFAX: \n954-924-1530/305-935-4227 \nEFTA00013595\n\nSIMINNIM \nAUSA \nUnited \nStates \nAttorney's \nOffice \nPage \n2 \nthem \nwith \nmy \nclients. \nOf \ncourse, \nno \npossible \nharm \nto \nthe \nGovernment \ncan \ncome \nfrom \nthe \nrelease \nof \nthe \ndocuments, \nas \nthis \ncriminal \nmatter \nis \nnow \nconcluded \n—  \nat \nleast \nfrom \nthe \nGovernment's \nperspective. \n3. \nI  \nam \nwondering \nabout \nyour \nposition \non \nthe \nconfidentiality \nprovision \nin \nthe \nagreement. \nAs \nI  \nunderstand \nthings \nfrom \nyour \nproposed \nstipulation, \nin \nSeptember \n2007 \nyou \n\"reached\" \nan \nagreement \nwith \nEpstein's \nattorneys \nthat \n\"contained \nan \nexpress \nconfidentiality \nprovision.\" \nAre \nyou \ntaking \nthe \nposition \nthat \nthis \n\"express\" \nprovision \nbarred \ndisclosure \nof \nthe \nsubstance \nof \nthe \nagreement \nto \nmy \nclients? \nAnd, \nif \nso, \nwould \nyou \nstipulate \nthat \nthe \nFBI \nagents \nand \nyour \noffice \ncomplied \nwith \nthe \nprovision \nup \nthrough \nAnte \n30 \nwhen, \nI \nassume, \nthe \nconfidential \nprovision \nexpired \nas \nEpstein \nentered \nhis \nguilty \nplea \nin \nopen \ncourt? \n4. \nYour \nproposed \nstipulation \nindicates: \nOn \nOctober \n26, \n2007, \nSpecial \nAgents \nand \nmet \nin \nperson \nwith \nJane \nDoe \n#1. \n1\n11.1.1s \nexplained \nth\nat \nth\ne \ninvestigation \nhad \nbeen \nresolved, \nthat \nEpstein \nwould \nplead \nguilty \nto \nstate \ncharges, \nhe \nwould \nbe \nrequired \nto \nregister \nas \na \nsex \noffender \nfor \nlife, \nand \nhe \nhad \nmade \ncertain \nconcessions \nrelated \nto \nthe \npayment \nof \ndamages \nto \nthe \nvictims, \nincluding \nJane \nDoe \n#1. \nDuring \nthis \nmeeting, \nJane \nDoe \n#1 \ndid \nnot \nraise \nany \nobjections \nto \nthe \nresolution \nof \nthe \nmatter. \nFrom \nthe \ndrafting \nof \nthis \nproposed \nstipulation, \nit \nappears \nthat \nyou \nmay \nbe \nworking \nfrom \na \nReport \nof \nInterview \nwith \nmy \nclient \n(i.e., \nan \nFBI \n302). \nMy \nclient \nhas \na \ndiffering \nrecollection \nof \nsome \naspects \nof \nthat \nmeeting. \nOf \ncourse, \nshe \ndid \nnot \ntake \nnotes \nof \nthe \nmeeting. \nTherefore, \nI  \nask \nthat \nyou \nprovide \nme \n(the \nrelevant \nparts \nof) \nany \nreport \nof \nthis \nmeeting \nas \nwell \nas \nreports \nof \nany \nother \nmeetings \nrelevant \nto \nthe \nmatters \nat \nhand. \nI  \nbelieve \nthat \nmy \nclient \nis \nentitled \nto \na \ncopy \nof \n(the \nrelevant \nparts \nof) \nthe \nreports \nof \ninterviews \nwith \nher. \nOf \ncourse, \na \ncriminal \ndefendant \nwould \nbe \nentitled \nto \nsuch \ndocuments. \nSee \nFed. \nR. \nCrim. \nP. \n16(aX1)(A) \n& \n(B). \nAs \nan \ninnocent \nvictim \nin \nthis \nmatter, \nmy \nclient \nshould \nbe \ntreated \nwith \nat \nleast \nthe \nsame \nconsideration. \nSee \n18 \nU.S.C. \n§ \n3771(a)(8) \n(victim's \nright \nto \n\"be \ntreated \nwith \nfairness\"). \n5. \nI \nam \nhoping \nthat \nthe \nSpecial \nAgents' \nand \nmy \nclient's \nrecollections \nabout \none \npoint \nof \nthe \nOctober \n26\nth\n \nmeeting \ncoincides: \nthat \nshe \nwas \nnever \ntold \nthat \nthe \nagreement \nblocked \nall \nfederal \nprosecution \nfor \nthe \ncrimes \nat \nhand. \nIs \na \nstipulation \non \nthat \npoint \nagreeable? \n2028 \nHARRISON \nSTREZT,SIIITR \n202, \nHOLLYWOOD, \nFLORIDA \n33020 \nOFFICE: \n2011 \nFAR: \n954-924-1530/306-935-4227 \nEFTA00013596\n\nAUSA \nUnited \nStates Attorney's Office \nPage 3 \n6. You mention your \nassistance in securing pro bono counsel for Jane Doe #1 to help \nprevent \nharassment. I  trust that \nyou \nwould be willing to stipulate that you did not \nmention the \nfederal non-prosecution agreement to this counsel and \nthat you did not mention that a  plea \nagreement had already been reached. Professor \nCassell has spoken to Meg Garvin, Esq., at the \nNational Crime Victims' Law Institute, and that is \nher recollection of the events. \n7. I  think that your proposed stipulation regarding my contact with the office is \nsomewhat abbreviated. I wonder what you would think about the following: \nIn mid-June 2008, Mr. Edwards contacted AUSA MI to inform her \nthat he represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. Mr. Edwards asked to \nmeet to provide information about the federal \ncrimes committed by Epstein, \n!leg\nto secure a \nsignificant federal indictment against Epstein. AUSA \nand Mr. \nEdwards discus sibility of federal charges being \nfiled. At the end of the call, AUSA asked Mr. \nEdwards to send any \ninformation that he wanted considered by the U.S. Attorney's Office in \ndetermining whether to file federal charges. Because of the confidentiality \nprovision that existed in the plea agreement, Mr. Edwards was not informed that, \nin September 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office had \nreached an agreement not to \nfile federal charges. Mr. Edwards was \nalso not informed that any resolution of the \ncriminal matter was imminent. \nOn July 3, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent to AUSA a letter, a true and \ncorrect copy of which is \nattached. In the letter, Mr. Edwards indicated his desire \nthat federal charges be filed against defendant \nEpstein. In particular, he wrote on \nbehalf of his clients: \"We urge the Attorney General and our United States \nAttorney to consider the fundamental import of the vigorous \nenforcement of our \nFederal laws. We urge you to move forward with the \ntraditional indictments and \ncriminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes Mr. Epstein has committed, \nand we \nfurther urge you to take the steps necessary to protect our children from \nthis very dangerous sexual predator.\" \nWhen Mr. Edwards wrote this letter, he \nwas still unaware that a non-prosecution \nagreement had been reached with \nEpstein. Mr. Edwards first \nlearned of this fact on or after July 9, 2008, when the \nGovernment filed its \nresponsive pleading to Jane Doe's emergency petition. That \npleading was the first public mention of the non\n-prosecution agreement and the \nfirst disclosure to Mr. Edwards and his clients. \n8. I \ntrust that you will agree that the Government \nhad probable cause to file a \nmultiple count federal indictment against \nEpstein, including an indictment charging crimes \n2028 \nHARRISON
