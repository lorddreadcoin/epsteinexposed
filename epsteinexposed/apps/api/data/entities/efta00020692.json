And I think I neglected to give similar \ninfo for the original folder linked to below (\"2019-04-18, Boies Schiller second subpoena response\") —  in that folder, we do \nnot need the \"!Original Zips\" folder or its contents, and do not need the three PDF documents in the main folder to be \nuploaded. \nAs always, please let me know if any questions or issues, and thanks very much. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, April 22, 2019 15:55 \nTo: \nCc: \n) \nSubject: RE: documents for Relativity \nWe can keep the folder structure that currently exists.

Does that work? \nAnd I don't believe there is DVD information (as in the \"BSF first production\" documents), but if there is, please let us \nknow.

Separately, though will we be able to play those video files *not* \non a DVD? That is, we only have them in electronic format (in the file folders) —  I haven't tried to play them, so maybe it's \njust as easy as that, but wanted to check if we need to get them processed in some other fashion to be able to view \nindependently of a DVD player. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, March 26,2019 09:32 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: documents for Relativity \nGood Morning = \nI have noticed that some of these documents contain data that appears to be from a DVD.
