My \nemployment history with the BOP is described in a  declaration \nI  submitted in the above-\ncaptioned case on August 5, 2020 (the \"Declaration\"). \n2. I submit this declaration in support of the BOP's \nmotion for summary judgment and to correct \ncertain \nstatements in the Declaration that incorrectly \ndescribed one record that BOP \nproduced in response to Plaintiffs' FOIA requests. \n3. In Paragraphs 17 and 30 of the \nDeclaration, I  stated that MCC's searches for records \nresponsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request had \nlocated \"one log book showing a  visitor for \nJeffrey Epstein on July 30, 2020.\" I \nhave since learned that this log book showed a phone \ncall Epstein made on July 30, 2020, not a visit that he received on that date. Specifically, the \nlog book is an Intake Screening \nPhone Log kept in the Receiving & Discharging area within \n1 \nEFTA00015515\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 38 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 2 \nthe MCC. 1 advertently described the log as \nshowing a visit, when, in fact, it shows a phone \ncall. \n4. For the same reason, Paragraph 28 of the Declaration should be corrected to reflect that the \nsearches at MCC located one log showing a phone call made by Epstein on July 30, 2020, \nspecifically the Intake Screening Phone Log described above. \nPursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1746, I declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is \ntrue and \ncorrect. \nete\nExecuted this t  \nday of October 2020. \n\\A \nnaCOCtAtC \nNico e \nMcFarland \nStaff Attorney \nMetropolitan Correctional Center \nBureau of Prisons \n2 \nEFTA00015516",
