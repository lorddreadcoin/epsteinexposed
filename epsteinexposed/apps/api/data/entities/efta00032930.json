    "text": "\n\nFrom: ' (USANYS)\"  \nTo: \" SANYS)\" \n(USANYS)\" \nSubject: OPR and PMRU Stuff \nDate: Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:22:47 +0000 \nSANYS \nHere's the relevant section of the Epstein OPR report, and the Justice Manual provision on the Professional \nMisconduct Review Unit, to which OPR findings of professional misconduct get referred. \nFrom the public Epstein OPR Executive Summary (fn's omitted): \nIII. OVERVIEW OF OPR'S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK \nOPR's primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the \nhighest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal law enforcement agency. \nAccordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct against current or former Department \nattorneys related to the exercise of their authority to investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice. OPR also has \njurisdiction to investigate allegations of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate \nto a Department attorney's alleged professional misconduct. \nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs the challenged conduct \nand whether a subject attorney violated that standard. Department attorneys are subject to various legal \nobligations and professional standards in the performance of their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, \nstandards of conduct imposed by attorney licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR \nfinds misconduct when it  concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a \nstandard intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR's analytical framework, when OPR concludes that (1) no \nclear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not intentionally or \nrecklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it  concludes that the subject's conduct does not \nconstitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude that a subject attorney's conduct does not \nsatisfy the elements necessary for a professional misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another \nfinding. In such cases, OPR may conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or \notherwise acted inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject attorney's \nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. \nFrom the Justice Manual \n1-4.320 -  Adjudicating \nFindings of Attorney Professional Misconduct—The \nProfessional Misconduct Review Unit \nMission. Where OPR has made findings of attorney professional misconduct, those findings are referred to the \nDepartment's Professional Misconduct Review Unit (PMRU). Consistent with memoranda issued separately by the Deputy \nAttorney General, the PMRU evaluates any findings of professional misconduct by 0PR and, where appropriate, issues fair, \ntimely, and consistent disciplinary decisions. The PMRU also authorizes referrals to the appropriate bar authority in those \ninstances in which OPR concludes that a current or former Department attorney violated a rule of professional conduct \nduring his or her tenure with the Department. \nAuthority of the PMRU. The PMRU has authority to handle disciplinary matters involving career Department attorneys, \nexcept for those employed in the law enforcement components and certain employees of the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review. The PMRU has no authority to adjudicate disciplinary actions in misconduct cases pertaining to non-\ncareer attorneys (whether appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, or otherwise politically appointed). The \nPMRU Chief has authority in his or her discretion to choose not to sustain findings of misconduct referred to the PMRU. \nThe PMRU Chief also has the authority in his or her discretion to include in the PMRU disciplinary decision any poor \njudgment findings in reports of investigation that are closely related to the professional misconduct findings referred to the \nPMRU. Closely related findings are those findings that arise from the same report of investigation, are made against the \nsame individual, and are based on the same or substantially similar conduct. The PMRU Chief's disciplinary authority \nEFTA00032930\n\nincludes the authority to resolve or authorize the resolution of any disciplinary action pending before the PMRU without \nthe PMRU reaching a final decision on the merits of the action. Depending on the circumstances, the PMRU Chief may \nserve as the Grievance Official to a Letter of Reprimand issued by a PMRU Attorney or the Deciding Official on a \nsuspension or removal action proposed by a PMRU Attorney. In all of its actions, the PMRU will operate in accordance \nwith the due \nprorates \nrequirements established in 5 U.S.C. § 7500 et seq., and 5 C.F.R. Part 752. \nBar Referrals. At the conclusion of any final disciplinary action by the PMRU, including any decision from a final \nappellate authority, if there is a final determination that a subject attorney committed professional misconduct implicating \na rule of professional conduct or when the PMRU Chief otherwise determines that a rule of professional conduct so \nrequires, the PMRU Chief will direct OPR to refer the subject attorney to the appropriate bar authority or authorities. For \nformer Department attorneys, the PMRU Chief may, after receiving an OPR report of investigation finding misconduct, \nissue a letter advising the subject attorney of the misconduct findings and informing the subject attorney of the right to \nsubmit an objection to OPR's findings. After receipt of an objection, if any, the PMRU Chief will determine if the matter \nwill be referred to the appropriate bar authority under the same procedures as for Department attorneys. \nThe Authority of the Deputy Attorney General. The Deputy Attorney General reserves the authority to designate \nindividuals outside of the PMRU to serve as proposing, deciding, or grievance officials in all disciplinary matters, including \nthose involving findings of professional misconduct by OPR, or to personally serve as the proposing, deciding, or grievance \nofficial. The Deputy Attorney General also reserves the right to designate an acting PMRU Chief. \n[updated September 2018] \nAssociate U.S. Attorney \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00032931",
