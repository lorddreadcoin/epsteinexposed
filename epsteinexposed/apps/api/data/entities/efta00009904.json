The degenerate Epstein knows it. The Degenerate Leon Black/Kushner BFF/ Milken \nproteges/Marc Rowan/Apollo knows it. \nThe DOJ/IRS knows it. \nIG, I have repeatedly offered to come to SEC DC HQ to have the brightest minds at the SEC totally humiliate me \nby refuting my allegations 1 by 1. The grossly corrupt SEC scumbags have never taken me up on my generous \noffer. For the very simple reason that ALL of my allegations are accurate and true. \nSo, I again put the offer out there: \nrefute my claims OR go to jail for the criminal obstruction ACTIVELY being facilitated by your office and the SEC. \nSo, let's give these scumbags the insurance/annuities market. \nThis will NOT end well for tens of thousands of Americans. \nWho \"green lighted\" this take over of the insurance industry by PE/Hedge funds? \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2018/02/01/apollo-and-blackstone-pick-insurance-as-their-next-\nbet-to-disrupt-wall-street/#5d647dbe7689 \nApollo And Blackstone Pick Insurance As Their \nNext Bet To Disrupt Wall Street - Forbes \nFor decades, Wall Streets gambit in insurance was to write \npolicies and use the float as a source of capital for new \nEFTA00009905\n\ninvestments.
