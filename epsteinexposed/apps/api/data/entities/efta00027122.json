We affirm. \nI. FACTS & \nPROCEDURAL \nBACKGROUND \nHernandez was employed as a \ncorrectional \nofficer \n(\"CO\") at the Big \nSpring \nCorrectional Center (\"BSCC\") \nin Big \nSpring, Texas from \n1999 until \nAugust \n2012. The \nfacility had a \nSpecial \nHousing Unit (\"SHU\") \nthat \nwas used \nto house high-risk \ninmates under \nadministrative \ndetention and disciplinary \nsegregation. Due to the nature \nof the high-risk inmates \nhoused in the SHU, \nthe \nCOs assigned to the unit \nhad additional duties, \nincluding documenting in \nwriting that they \nhad conducted random \nsafety \nchecks every 30 \nminutes \nduring \ntheir shifts, with notations for any unusual \nactivity \nor reasons if \none or \nmore \nof the rounds could not be \nconducted. \nFormal \ninmate \ncounts and fire \nand safety \nchecks of the unit \nwere to also be conducted \nseveral \ntimes during a \n12\n-hour \nshift and \ndocumented in writing. The COs \nassigned to \nthe SHU \nwere also \nrequired to sign Post Orders Quarterly Signature \nSheets, \nwhich \nconfirmed that \nthey had read and understood the specific \nrequirements for \nworking \nwith the \nhigh-risk inmates housed in the SHU. \nInmate Luis Bent was \nhoused in \nthe SHU \nwhen \nhe committed \nsuicide \nin \nhis cell on August \n23, 2012. Prior to his \ndeath, \nBent \nwas \ntransferred \nupon his \nown request to the SHU \non August 21, \n2012. \nOn \nAugust 22, \n2012, Bent was \nevaluated by medical personnel. According \nto the \nprogress \nnotes taken at that \ntime, \nBent's mental state \nhad deteriorated \nsignificantly since his last \nevaluation a week prior on August 15, 2012. Bent's \nAugust \n15th \nevaluation \nindicated that his \nsleep, mood, energy \nand \nappetite \nwere all \n\"good\" \nand \nFrederick Hernandez's term of imprisonment is \nscheduled to \nbe \ncompleted on August \n25, 2015. As such, \nHernandez filed a  motion to \nexpedite \nconsideration of \nhis appeal on \nJanuary 26, 2015. This court granted the \nmotion on \nJanuary 30, 2015. \n2 \nEFTA00027123\n\nCase: 14-11080 \nDocument: 00513025851 \nPage: 3 \nDate \nFiled: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed \n04/30/15 Page 3 of 12 PagelD 424 \nNo. 14-11080 \n\"normal.\" \nBent's August 22nd \nevaluation, \nwhich took \nplace at \n1:20 p.m. the \nday after his \ntransfer to the \nSHU, \nindicated \nthat he was \nparanoid, \nrambling, \nand that he had \n\"[l]oosening of associations, \npoor \njudgment, \npoor insight; no \nsuicidal \nthoughts, no homicidal thoughts[.]\" \n(emphasis in \noriginal). Although \nthe record \nindicates that \nsome of \nthe COs \nwere generally \naware of \nBent's \nmedical \nevaluation, there is \nnothing in the record \nindicating \nthat Hernandez \nor any of other the COs reviewed the \nAugust 22nd \nprogress \nnotes, \nnor have \nthey claimed to have reviewed the progress notes. \nCO \nJoey Rosas \nworked in the \nSHU from \n8:00 p.m. to \n11:45 p.m. on \nAugust 22, 2012. \nRosas stated in \nsubsequent \ninvestigations that he had \nexpressed \nconcerns about \nBent's mental \nstate prior to \nBent's suicide. He \nalso \nstated \nthat he was \npersonally told \nwhen he arrived \nfor his August \n22nd shift \nthat Bent had been evaluated by \nmedical \npersonnel earlier \nthat day \n(approximately 1:20 p.m.) who had \ndetermined \nat \nthat \ntime that \nhe was \n\"thrown off' but \n\"okay.\" \nHernandez also reported for his \nshift \nthat day \nat 8:00 \np.m. \nand was \nassigned to work in the \ncontrol \nroom while \nother \nofficers were \nassigned to \nconduct rounds and patrol the perimeter. \nHernandez \nstated \nthat \nwhen he and \nthe other \nofficers arrived for their shifts, \nthe COs \nfrom the \nprevious shift \ninformed them that Bent had been \nbehaving \nstrangely and \nacting \n\"crazy\" \nduring shift change, which was several hours after \nhis \nmedical \nevaluation \nwhen it was reported that he was \n\"okay.\" The \nCOs \nwere also \ninformed that \nBent was reportedly acting \"suicidal\" and \nholding up \nsigns in his \ncell door \nwhich read \"DEA,\" \"death,\" and \"help.\" \nCO \nChristopher Moore \nbegan his shift \njust after \nmidnight at 12:15 \na.m. \non August 23, 2012. \nHe stated that, \nwhile \nhe was \nin the control \nroom \nwhere \nHernandez was \nassigned to work \nwith \nother \ncorrectional \nofficers, they \n3 \nEFTA00027124\n\nCase: \n14-11080 Document: 00513025851 \nPage: 4 \nDate Filed: 04/30/2015 \nCase 1:14-cr-00018-O-BL Document 105 Filed 04/30/15 Page 4 of 12 PagelD 425 \nNo. \n14-11080 \ndiscussed a prior suicide attempt \nwhich had occurred earlier that month \nin the \nSHU. \nDuring \nthe \ncourse of Hernandez's \nshift, he \nconducted \na \nmandatory move \nof inmates \nfrom one \ncell to another, \na \nprocedure carried out \nevery 21 \ndays. \nAfter \nmoving the inmates, Hernandez provided \nthem \nwith \nsupplies to clean \ntheir cells. Lights in the SHU were turned off \nat 11:00 \np.m. While \nthe lights \nwere off in the SHU, the COs \ncompleted \ntheir \nrequired \npaperwork. The \npaperwork included SHU \nControl Log forms \ninitialed and submitted by \nHernandez indicating that \nofficial inmate counts had \nbeen conducted at 12:01 \na.m., \n3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. \nHernandez also initialed and \nsubmitted forms \nsigned by \nthe \nother \nCOs \nassigned to that shift \nindicating \nthat \neach required \n30-minute safety check had been conducted. \nThe lights \nwere not turned on \nagain until \nHernandez turned them on at \n5:26 a.m. on August 23, \n2012. Almost \nimmediately \nthereafter, Hernandez was \nnotified that Bent had been found dead in his \ncell, \nhanging from a bed \nsheet. \nHernandez reported the incident to the \nmain \ncontrol \ncenter, \nnotified the \nmedical department, and requested 911 \nemergency \nservices. Bent was \nthen \ntransported to \nScenic \nMountain \nHospital in \nBig Spring, \nTexas where he \nwas \npronounced \ndead. The cause of death was \ndetermined at \nthat time to be \nsuicide. \nAn \ninvestigation \ncommenced into the \nevents \nprior \nto Bent's \ndeath, \nfocusing on \nthe 12-hour shift \nduring \nwhich \nHernandez \nand the other COs \nworked, beginning \non August 22 and \nending on \nAugust 23, \n2012. \nUltimately, \nHernandez \nadmitted to entering false \ninformation on the \nforms \nindicating that \nthe official inmate counts had been conducted. \nHe \nalso \nadmitted \nto initialing \nand submitting the \nfalsified reports \ncompiled \nand \nsigned by the \nother COs \nindicating that they had \nconducted \nthe \nmandatory \n30\n-minute safety \nchecks, 24 \nof which were required to be \nperformed during \neach \n12\n-hour shift. \nIn total, the \n4 \nEFTA00027125\n\nCase: \n14-11080 \nDocument: \n00513025851 \nPage: 5 \nDate \nFiled: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed 04/30/15 Page 5 \nof 12 PagelD 426 \nNo. 14-11080 \ninvestigation revealed that not a  single 30-minute safety check or formal \ninmate count was conducted during Hernandez's shift, which amounted to \ndozens of \nfalsified log entries showing that the \nchecks and \ncounts had been \nperformed. \nHernandez and the other \nCOs \nadmitted that the \npractice of \nfalsifying the \nforms to indicate that the \nsafety checks and formal inmate \ncounts \nhad \nbeen \nconducted was a \ncommon, \nlong-standing practice \namong the \nofficers \nworking in \nthe SHU. \nHernandez stated that the practice \nof \nfalsifying forms \nwas in \npart a \nresult of staff \nshortages, 12\n-hour \nshifts, and the \nassignment of \nofficers \nto the SHU who were not \nfamiliar \nwith working there. Hernandez \nand \nthe other COs connected to the incident were \nterminated. \nHernandez and \nthe other officers \nwere \ncharged in a 7-count indictment \nfor making false \nstatements and aiding and \nabetting, \nbased on having signed \nand submitted \nfalsified SHU Control \nLog forms \nand the falsified \n30-minute \nsafety \ncheck forms. \nPursuant to a \nwritten \nplea \nagreement, Hernandez pled \nguilty to Count \n7  of the 7\n-count \nindictment, \nwhich \nadjudged him \nguilty of \nviolating \n18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1001 & 1002\n—false \nstatements and \naiding and \nabetting\n—on \naccount of having signed \nand \nsubmitted to the \nDepartment of \nJustice the \nfalsified SHU Control Log form \ncertifying that \nthe mandatory \nformal \ninmate \ncounts had \nbeen \nconducted \nduring his shift. In \naccordance with \nhis \nplea \nagreement, Hernandez waived his \nright to appeal his \nconviction but \nreserved the right to \ndirectly appeal \"any \nissue \narising from sentencing.\" The \ndistrict court \naccepted the plea agreement \nand \nentered \njudgment in accordance \ntherewith. \nThe presentence \ninvestigation \nreport (\"PSR\") \nrecommended a base \noffense level of 6, with an increase to \nlevel 14 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \n§ \n2B1.1(b)(15)(A) for an offense \nthat involved \"the \nconscious or reckless risk of \ndeath or serious \nbodily injury.\" A \nsubtraction \nof 2 \nlevels for \nacceptance of \nresponsibility \nresulted \nin a  total \noffense \nlevel of 12. \nHernandez \nalso had a \n5 \nEFTA00027126\n\nCase: \n1441080 Document: 00513025851 Page: 6 \nDate \nFiled: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed \n04/30/15 Page 6 of 12 PagelD 427 \nNo. 14-11080 \ncriminal \nhistory \ncategory of I. \nThis produced \nan \nadvisory \nguidelines range of \n10 to 16 months' imprisonment. \nHernandez objected to the \n\"conscious or reckless risk\" \nenhancement, \narguing that that the legal \ndefinition of \"reckless\" required that he \nconsciously \ndisregard a \nknown risk and \nhe was not aware of \nBent's \nsuicidal intent. The \nPSR Addendum maintained \nthat Hernandez disregarded specific \npolicies set \nforth \nfor the care and custody of high-risk inmates \nhoused in \nthe SHU and \ninformation regarding \nBent's mental state, \nincluding \nstatements from other \nofficers \nindicating that he was acting \n\"crazy\" and \n\"suicidal\" hours \nbefore he \ncommitted suicide in his cell. The Addendum \nfurther \nreasoned that \nHernandez's \"failure to perform \nthe duties required of [his \nposition], which \nmight \nproduce death and was \nreckless, resulted in the death of an \ninmate \nknown to be a risk for suicide.\" \nOverruling Hernandez's \nobjection to the enhancement \nand adopting the \nfindings of the \nPSR and PSR \nAddendum, the district \ncourt \nsentenced him to 10 \nmonths' \nimprisonment, stating \nthat \"it adequately \naddress[es] the sentencing \nobjectives of punishment and \ndeterrence.\" Hernandez \nwas also sentenced to \ntwo years of \nsupervised release following the \ncompletion of \nhis sentence and \npayment of a \nmandatory special assessment. \nHernandez is \ncurrently \nserving his 10-month \nprison \nsentence \nand has \nfi\nled this \nappeal. \nII. \nDISCUSSION \nIt is \nundisputed that \nHernandez preserved his \nchallenge to the \napplication of the sentencing \nenhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(15)(A). \nOn \nappeal, Hernandez asserts \ntwo primary arguments with \nrespect to the \nsentencing enhancement. \nFirst, \nhe contends \nthat the \ndistrict \ncourt erred by \ninterpreting the enhancement as \nrequiring only \nobjective \nknowledge by the \ndefendant of the risk of death or serious \nbodily injury, \nrather than \nsubjective \n6 \nEFTA00027127\n\nCase: \n14-11080 \nDocument: 00513025851 Page: 7 \nDate Filed: \n04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed \n04/30/15 Page 7 of 12 PagelD 428 \nNo. \n14-11080 \nknowledge of the risk. Second, he argues that the district court erred in finding \nthat he \nshould \nhave \nknown that inmate \nBent \npresented a risk of \nsuicide. We \nfind these \narguments \nunpersuasive. \nA. Standard \nof Review \n\"This \ncourt \nreviews the \napplication of \nthe \nsentencing guidelines de novo \nand reviews \nthe district \ncourt's fi\nndings of fact \nfor clear error.\" See United \nStates v. Garcia\n-Guerrero, \n313 F.3d 892, 895 \n(5th Cir. 2002) \n(citation omitted). \n\"A factual finding \nis not \nclearly erroneous as long as \nit is \nplausible in light of \nthe record \nas a \nwhole.\" See United States v. \nDuncan, 191 F.3d \n569, 575 (1999) \n(citation \nomitted). \n\"[T]his court will uphold a \nsentence unless \nit was imposed \nin violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing \nguidelines or \nit \nis outside the range \nof the \napplicable guideline and is \nunreasonable.\" Garcia-Guerrero, 313 F.3d at 895 \n(citation omitted). \nB. \nAnalysis \nThe U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \nprovide under Section 2B1.1(b)(15)(A) \nthat, if the offense \nat issue involved \"the conscious or \nreckless risk of death or \nseriously \nbodily injury,\" \nthen \"increase to \nlevel \n14.\" See U.S.S.G. \n§  2B1.1(b)(15)(A). \nConsequently, the primary \nissue in \nthese proceedings is \nwhether the \nsentencing enhancement applied by the \ndistrict \ncourt required \nHernandez to \nhave subjective or objective knowledge \nof \nthe risk of death or \nserious bodily \ninjury. As \nnoted by both parties, the \nGuidelines do not define \n\"conscious \nor reckless risk of death or \nserious bodily \ninjury,\" and the \napplication \nnotes do not \nmention the \nprovision. Further, \nthis court has not \nruled on \nthis issue \nbefore. \nSeveral of \nour \nsister circuits, \nhowever, \nhave ruled on this issue. The \nmajority \nof those circuits have held that the \nGovernment is not required to \nprove \nthat \nthe defendant \nwas \nsubjectively \naware of the \nrisk, but \nrather only \nthat the defendant was objectively \naware of the risk, i.e., that the risk \"would \n7 \nEFTA00027128\n\nCase: \n14-11080 Document: 00513025851 Page: 8 \nDate \nFiled: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed 04/30/15 Page 8 \nof 12 Pagel D 429 \nNo. 14-11080 \nhave \nbeen obvious to a reasonable \nperson.\" \nSee United \nStates u. \nMaestas, 642 \nF.3d 1315, 1321 \n(10th Cir. \n2011) \n(reasoning that \n\"recklessness is generally an \nobjective standard\" and that \n\"a defendant's \nconduct \ninvolves a \nconscious risk if \nthe \ndefendant was \nsubjectively \naware\" of the risk and \n\"a defendant's conduct \ninvolves a reckless risk if the risk ... \nwould have been obvious to a reasonable \nperson.\"); United \nStates v. Lucien, 347 F.3d 45, 56 \n(2nd Cir. \n2003) \n(determining \nthat the Ninth Circuit's \"conclusion that \na defendant does not have to \nsubjectively \nknow that \nhis or her conduct \ncreated \na  serious \nbodily risk, is \ncorrect.\"); United States \nu. Johanson, 249 F.3d \n848, 859 (9th \nCir. 2001) (\"We \ndo not believe \nthat a \ndefendant can \nescape the \napplication of the \nserious risk \nof injury \nenhancement by claiming that he was \nnot \naware \nthat his conduct \ncreated a serious risk, that is, a \ndefendant \ndoes not have \nto \nsubjectively know \nthat \nhis conduct created \nthe risk.\"). \nThese \ncircuits consistently reject \nthe \nEight Circuit's \nholding in \nUnited \nStates \nv. McCord, \nInc., which \nadopts the \nGuideline's \ninvoluntary \nmanslaughter \ndefinition of \n\"reckless\" \nas \"a \nsituation in \nwhich the \ndefendant \nwas aware of the \nrisk created by his conduct.\" 143 F.3d 1095, 1098 (8th \nCir. 1998) \n(citation \nomitted). A \nprimary \nreason behind their \nrejections of \nthis definition is that it \nrenders the \ndistinction \nbetween \n\"conscious\" and \n\"reckless\" \nmeaningless, \nwhich \nis \nnonsensical in light \nof the Section's \ndisjunctive phrasing, i.e., \n\"conscious or \nreckless risk.\" See Maestas, 642 \nF.3d at \n1321; \nJohanson, 249 F.3d at 858; \nLucien, 347 \nF.3d at 56. \nThe facts of this case, \nhowever, do not require \nthat we decide today \nwhether \nthe enhancement applied by the \ndistrict \ncourt \nrequired \nthat \nHernandez have \nsubjective as opposed to \nobjective \nknowledge of \nthe risk of \ndeath or \nserious \nbodily injury. \nThe PSR \nand PSR \nAddendum, \nthe remainder \nof the record, and \nHernandez's \nown \nadmissions indicate that \nhe was \nsubjectively \naware of the risk of \ndeath or serious bodily \ninjury. \nSpecifically, \n8 \nEFTA00027129\n\nCase: \n14-11080 \nDocument: \n00513025851 \nPage: 9 \nDate \nFiled: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed 04/30/15 Page 9 of 12 PagelD 430 \nNo. 14-11080 \nHernandez conceded \nthat \nwhen he and the \nother COs \nreported \nto begin their \n8:00 p.m. \nshifts, \nthey were told by \nthe officers on \nthe prior \nshift \nthat Bent was \nacting \n\"crazy\" and \n\"suicidal\" and had been \nholding up signs \nin his cell door that \nread \"death\" and \n\"help.\" \nOn \nappeal, Hernandez points to the medical \nevaluation notes taken by \nprison medical personnel the day prior to Bent's suicide. \nThese progress notes, \nhowever, have \nno \nbearing on Hernandez's \nsubjective \nknowledge of the risk of \nsuicide \npresented by Bent when he falsified the \nreports for his 12\n-hour shift on \nAugust 22nd \nthrough 23rd. According to the \nrecord, it was \nRosas—not \nHernandez—who had discussed \nBent's afternoon \nmedical \nevaluation \nwith the \nofficers from \nthe previous \nshift and who was \nreportedly told \nthat Bent was \n\"thrown off' but \n\"okay.\" However, even if \nHernandez \nwas made \naware of \nRosas's conversation with the other \nofficers, that information is negated by \nthe \nfact \nthat COs working during the afternoon of \nthe 1:20 \np.m. evaluation \nreported to Hernandez that Bent \nwas acting \"crazy\" during shift \nchange, \nseveral hours after the \nevaluation. \nFurther, there is \nno evidence in the record \nthat \nHernandez reviewed \nBent's medical \nprogress \nnotes at any point \nor \nknew \nof their \ncontent prior \nto Bent's suicide, nor \ndoes \nHernandez advance this \nargument on \nappeal. Further, \nas \npointed \nout by \nthe Government, it seems \nsomewhat \nunlikely that officers who \nwere \nunwilling to \nperform even one single \nmandatory duty involving safety \nchecks and formal inmate \ncounts would have \ntaken the time to \nconduct an elective review \nof an \ninmate's medical progress \nnotes. \nAdditionally, Moore \nstated \nthat the COs \nworking in the control \nroom \nthat night after shift change (which \nincluded Hernandez) discussed a previous \nsuicide attempt \nwhich took place in the SHU \nearlier that month, after being \ntold of Bent's \n\"crazy\" and \"suicidal\" behavior by the \nofficer's \nfrom the previous \nshift. \n9 \nEFTA00027130\n\nCase: 14-11080 \nDocument: \n00513025851 Page: 10 \nDate Filed: 04/30/2015 \nCase \n1:14-cr-00018-O-BL \nDocument 105 Filed 04/30/15 \nPage 10 of 12 PagelD 431 \nNo. 14-11080 \nIn \nsum, according to Hernandez's own \nadmissions \nand the evidence in \nthe \nrecord, we conclude that Hernandez \nhad \nsubjective \nknowledge—less than \nten hours \nprior to \nBent's death\n—that \nBent \npresented a suicide risk. \nHernandez \nwas told that Bent was acting \n\"suicidal,\" \nholding up signs that \nsaid \n\"help\" and \"death,\" and had been moved to the \nSHU \nfor high\n-risk inmates at \nhis \nown \nrequest. Hernandez was present in \nthe \ncontrol room when \nseveral COs \nhad \na \nconversation \nabout a \nprevious suicide \nattempt by an inmate \nin the KW \nearlier that \nmonth. Hernandez does not claim to \nhave \nreviewed Bent's medical \nrecords or to \nhave had personal knowledge that \nBent \nwas reported to \nhave been \n\"okay\" \nafter his medical evaluation \nearlier that day. Regardless, \neven if \nHernandez did have personal \nknowledge of Bent's medical \nevaluation, that \ninformation was \nnegated by \nthe \nstatements \nmade by the \nofficers who were \nworking \nafter \nBent's medical \nevaluation \nwho \nreported him as acting \"crazy\" \nseveral hours later during the shift \nchange. These facts dearly show \nthat \nHernandez was made aware, \nalmost immediately upon \nbeginning his shift, \nthat Bent presented a suicide risk. \nBased \non this evidence, the \ndistrict court made a \nfactual determination \nthat Hernandez \nconsciously or recklessly \ndisregarded the \nrisk of death or \nserious bodily \ninjury when he falsified the reports \nindicating that the safety \nchecks and \ncounts had \nbeen performed \nwhen they \nhad not. \nMoreover, even if \nit was not \nfeasible for \nHernandez to \nconduct \nevery single \ncount or \nsafety check, \nhis decision to decline to \nconduct even one \nsingle \ncheck or \ncount during the \nentire 12-hour shift, in light of the information he \nconceded \nhe knew about \nBent's erratic \nbehavior, supports the \ndistrict court's factual \ndetermination \nthat \nHernandez consciously or recklessly \ndisregarded the risk. Accordingly, the \ndistrict court's \nconclusion that \nHernandez's offenses under \n18 \nU.S.C. §§ 1001 \n& 1002 \ninvolved \"the conscious \nor reckless risk of \ndeath \nor \nserious bodily \ninjury\" was \"plausible in light of the record as a \nwhole.\" \nSee \nDuncan, \n191 F.3d \n10 \nEFTA00027131\n\nCase: 14-11080 \nDocument: \n00513025851 Page: 11 \nDate Filed: 04/30/2015 \nCase 1:14-cr-00018-O-BL Document 105 Filed 04/30/15 Page 11 of 12 PagelD 432 \nNo. 14-11080 \nat 575 (citation omitted).
