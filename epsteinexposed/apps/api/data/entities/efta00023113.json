NY 10007 \nmailto:\nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM <bcstemheim@mac.com> \nSent: \nWednesday. \nDecember 30.2020 8:43 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSANYS ; \nChristian Everdell , Mark \nS. Cohen \nSubject: \nGhislaine Maxwell 02879-509 \nGood \nmorning, \nI am responding to select portions of yesterday's email: \nMs. Maxwell reports that she is searched, patted, and wanded multiple times per day \n1- Isolation Cell to Day Room \n(USANYS)\n12/30/2020 1:20 \nEFTA00023113\n\n2- Day Room to VTC \nRoom \n-\n3 \n- VTC Room to Day Room \n4- Day Room to Isolation Cell \n2 additional searches if she goes to and from recreation. \nIn addition,mulitple times per day, she is required -to remove her shoes for inspection of her feet and shoes -to \nremove her mask for inspection of her mouth (now with a \nflashlight) \naccompanied by inspection inside and behind her ears. \nHer cell is search multiple times per day: \nIn her presence- when she is taken out of her Isolation Cell in the morning Outside her presence-evidenced by \nitems removed from her locker and papers left in disarray. \nAlso, her personal papers are searched in the Day Room. \nAt least 2 guards have eyes on her while she showers (her feet and head \nexposed) -\"for her safety.\" \nRe: ambient temperature, which registered 68.6 on 12/21 (and decreases during the night)- Monday night (12/28) \nthe ambient temperature was taken just inside the door frame of her Isolation Cell, not near the external non-\ninsulated concrete wall on which condensation accumulates due to differentials between external and internal \ntemperature. \nMs. Maxwell was given the third blanket in response to her being cold after condensation had accumulated. \nUnlike other inmates - whose body temperatures elevate heat in common areas - Ms. Maxwell is an isolated \ninmate; no heat is generated from others to provide additional heat. \nGiven that she is surveilled 24 hours a day by handheld and stationery cameras, is escorted from locked area to \nlocked area in the custody and control of 3 to 6 guards, and has no contact with any other inmates, it is \nunreasonable to compare her circumstances to any other inmate. \nThe searching is disproportionate to the amount of security and cameras focused directly on her and her \ncircumstances as an isolated inmate under constant surveillance. \nThank you for your continued assistance. \nBest wishes to you and your family for a happy and healthy new year. \nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
