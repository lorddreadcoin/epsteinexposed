We could write something at the end along the lines that the Government is available to answer questions or try to \naddress any concerns they have. \nOn Apr 28, 2021, at 10:00 PM, <> wrote: \nYup, this has been on my list today, I just haven't had the chance to review other trial witness 302s to determine \nwhether she's coming up at trial in a meaningful way. On the letter, thanks for taking a first pass. On the last \nhighlighted piece, I'm inclined not to respond directly — it feels odd giving legal procedure advice to a UK lawyer \nrepresenting a non-party in a letter copying the presiding judge. But let me know if you think there's anything we \nshould say about that. \nOn conferral, I'd suggest we just send them the letter tomorrow and ask them to let us know if there's anything we \nneed to discuss. If you want to let them know now that's what we're planning to do, that works. \nFrom: \n) \nSent: Wednesday, April 28, 2021 9:45 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc:\nSubject: Re: US v.

We therefore intend to seek a clarifying \norder excluding time, both in light of the still-pending suppression motion, which automatically excludes time, and in \nthe interests of justice to allow for trial preparation. Would you please let us know whether you consent to the \nexclusion? \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n<2021-04-30 Gov't Letter to Manley.docx> \nEFTA00022506",
