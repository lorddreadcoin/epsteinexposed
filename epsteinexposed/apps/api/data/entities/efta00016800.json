I took the \nphoto because the woman seemed to be underage \nand seemed romantically linked to the older man. \nThe pair were walking closely together \n-he was holding a small Victoria's Secret boutique bag in his \nhand. I was concerned for the well-being of the girl. To me, she seemed to be \nbetween fourteen and \nsixteen years of age. \nAt the time I took the photo, I had not heard of Jeffrey Epstein. On the following Monday, I read \nabout Mr. Epstein's arrest. I am submitting it for your own analysis and review. \nThe photo was \ntaken on the corner of %1st St and stn Ave at \nOlympic Tower on 7 June 2019 at \n6:46PM. \nI hope it may be of help —also in ending trafficking and abuse, especially as pertains to minors. I \napologise for the delay in submitting it —  I was unsure of where to send it. \nSincerely, \nM. Rachel \nZabala \nEFTA00016800\n\nEFTA00016801\n\nEFTA00016802",
