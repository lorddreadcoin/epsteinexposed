She has never been found. \nIn Series 1, episode 3, Portuguese journalists refer to a scandal that took place years earlier regarding \nchild abuse in a Portuguese orphanage. It is referred to as the Pact of Silence. In connection with the \norphanage, Casa Pia, a journalist states that it is a known fact that American \nmillionaires were \nflying  \ninto Portugal on private  jets for the purpose of sexually abusing these children. \nThis might be a line of enquiry that you may wish to follow up. \nYours truly, \nEFTA00023038",
