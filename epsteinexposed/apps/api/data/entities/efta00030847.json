All mail must be processed in \na particular manner prior to being provided to an inmate. The legal \ndepartment is not involved in the processing of mail for any inmates in \nInstitution. The institution is not allowing visitors, therefore the \nmail may not be hand delivered, but again, the mail must be properly \nprocessed before provided to the inmate. Unfortunately, this is not \nsomething I can assist with. \n>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM <1/20/2021 1:27 PM >» \nMs. Maxwell needs to review time-sensitive documents for filing on \nMonday 1/25. \nIt appears that overnight express mail is not received next day and \ndelivery to Ms.Maxwell is further delayed. \nPlease let me know if we can hand-deliver legal mail for Ms. Maxwell to \nthe MDC for direct deposit in the legal mail box. \nIf so, can delivery to Ms. Maxwell be expedited? \nYour assistance is greatly appreciated. \nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
