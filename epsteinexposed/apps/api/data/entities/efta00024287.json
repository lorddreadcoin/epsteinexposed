She is working hard with your \nvictims' coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US \nthen we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22rd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will \nprobably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the \ninterview (from 2-4). \nis going to be attending the meeting and she said she could interview with you right after the \nmeeting. I believe the notice says the meeting starts at 10:00 on October 23rd so maybe we plan to meet you at 12:00 \ndepending on the length of the victims' meeting. \nalso wanted to come to the meeting. I know you met with her for a short while. If you would like to meet \nwith her for a more detailed interview we could do that on the afternoon of October 22nd from 4 —  6 if that works. \nEFTA00024289\n\nis She would like to try to attend via skype or some kind of conference line. \nI know you interviewed her sister If you would like to also interview I can set something up. \nLet me know if that works. \nBest, \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \nwww.bsfIlp.com \nFrom: \n[mailto \nSent: Thursday, October 10, 2019 3:39 PM \nTo: \nSigrid McCawley \nCc: \n; \nSubject: Interviews - 10/22 and 10/23 \nHi Sigrid, \nHope you're doing well.
