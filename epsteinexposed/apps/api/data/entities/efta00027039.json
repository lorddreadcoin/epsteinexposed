    "text": "\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 1 of 5 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nALAN DERSHOWITZ, \nDefendant. \nALAN DERSHOWITZ, \nCounterclaim Plaintiff, \nv. \nCounterclaim Defendant. \nCivil Action No. I :19-cv-3377 (LAP) \nPLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HER \nMOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT \nPursuant to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff\n-\nrespectfully requests leave of the Court to file the attached Amended Complaint. This motion \nshould be granted for three reasons. First, since Plaintiff filed her complaint in April 2019, the \nrevival provision of the New York Child Victims Act has gone into effect, reviving a battery claim \nagainst Defendant Alan Dershowitz that had previously been time barred. N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 214-g. \nSecond, since Plaintiff filed her Complaint, Defendant has produced a copy of a recording \nthat he represents captures a  portion of a confidential telephonic settlement conference between \nEFTA00027039\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 2 of 5 \nhimself and Plaintiff's attorney, David Boles.' This unauthorized recording, use, and disclosure of \na  communication made on Plaintiff's behalf for the purpose of defaming Plaintiff violates 18 \nU.S.C. § 2511(1). As a \"person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication\" was \"intercepted, \ndisclosed, [and] intentionally used in violation\" of that provision, Ms. is entitled to recover \nfrom Mr. Dershowitz. Id. § 2520. \nFinally, since Plaintiff filed her Complaint, Defendant's campaign of defamatory \nstatements against Ms. has not only continued but has intensified. Each new defamatory \nstatement gives rise to a  new claim for defamation. Although the frequency with which Mr. \nDershowitz defames her will prevent Ms. from amending her complaint every time Mr. \nDershowitz publishes a  new defamatory statement, the scope and nature of the new statements \njustify an amendment in this instance, especially given that Ms. is amending the complaint \nto add the other two claims. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that a  plaintiff may amend her complaint \n\"with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" FED. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). \"The \ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Id. \nIn the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith \nor dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies \nby amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by \nvirtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave \nsought should, as the rules require, `be \nfreely given.' \nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (quoting FED. R. Ctv. P. 15(a)). \"[A]bsent a showing \nof bad faith or undue prejudice,\" mere delay \"does not provide a  basis ... to deny the right to \namend.\" State Teachers Ret. Bd. v. Fluor Corp., 654 F.2d 843, 856 (2d Cir. 1981). Moreover, \"the \nDershowitz had previously claimed to have such a  recording, but Plaintiff and her \nattorneys did not obtain access to it until after the complaint was filed. \n2 \nEFTA00027040\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 3 of 5 \nparty opposing the amendment bears the burden of showing prejudice, bad faith, and futility ....\" \nWilliams v. Epic Security Corp., 358 F. Supp. 3d 284, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quotation marks \nomitted). \nThere is no reason to deny leave to amend in this instance. Defendant has no valid basis to \nallege \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive\" on Plaintiff's part: the events precipitating the \nbattery and Wiretap Act claims occurred while a motion to dismiss the Complaint was pending. \nMany of the new defamatory statements occurred during the same period or even more recently. \nWhen it  denied the motion to dismiss, the Court also disqualified Plaintiff's counsel. Her new \ncounsel have worked diligently since their retainer less than two months ago to develop Plaintiff's \nnew claims. \nDefendant will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The case is in its early stages, with \nparties making initial disclosures this week, and most of the factual allegations underpinning \nPlaintiff's new claims—including the truth or falsity of the new defamatory statements—depend \non the same body of proof as the claims and counterclaims already in suit. \nDefendant has indicated that he will argue that the claims are futile. The only ground for \nfutility his counsel has identified—that Plaintiff was too old at the time of the battery to invoke \nthe revival statute, see Transcript of Dec. 2, 2019, Status Conference, Doc. No. 96 at 20 (\"Dec. 2 \nTr.\")—raises a question of fact unsuitable for resolution on a motion to amend. See, e.g., Benton \nv.  Broolyield Properties Corp., 2004 WL 1335908, *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2004) (granting leave \nto amend where merits of new claim depended upon a question of fact). The statute re-opens the \nlimitations period for one year beginning in August 2019 for civil actions arising from conduct \nthat violated Article 130 of the Penal Code committed against the Plaintiff before the age of 18. \nN.Y.C.P.L.R. § 214-g. The proposed Amended Complaint alleges Defendant sexually assaulted \n3 \nEFTA00027041\n\nCase 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 4 of 5 \nher prior to the age of 18. See Proposed Amended Complaint ¶¶ 38, attached as Exhibit A to the \nDeclaration of Haley Proctor (Dec. 20, 2019) (\"Proposed Am. Compl.\"). Accordingly, the battery \nclaim is not futile. \nThe Court independently raised the question whether Ms. would have \"standing\" \nto make a claim under the Wiretap Act. See Dec. 2 Tr. at 21. Section 2520 of Title 18 provides for \ncivil relief under the Act for \"any person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication is \nintercepted, disclosed, or intentionally used in violation of this chapter.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a) \n(emphasis added). Thus, Plaintiff must have a \"possessory interest\" in the communication to bring \na claim under the Act. Smoot v. United Transp. Union, 246 F.3d 633, 640 (6th Cir. 2001). Courts \nhave held that statements made by an agent of the plaintiff in course of the agent's representation \nof the plaintiff are possessed by the plaintiff and thus are sufficient to confer standing to bring a \nWiretap Act claim. E.g., id. at 640-41. In the Proposed Amended Complaint, Ms. has \nsufficiently alleged a possessory interest because the captured communication was a confidential \nsettlement communication made by her attorney. See Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76, 117-18. \nAccordingly, the Wiretap Act claim is not futile. \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion \nfor Leave To File an Amended Complaint. \nDated: December 20, 2019 Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ \nCharles J.
