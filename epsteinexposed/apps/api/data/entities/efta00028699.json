As you'll see in the first \nbullet point, we reference the DOJ-OIG review. We do not plan to make mention of a report, although if asked at a court \nconference whether there will be a report, we plan to say that we don't know, and that OIG's normal process is to \nprepare a report but we don't know whether it will be made public or not. \nPlease let us know if you have any objections to the language in the letter. Thanks again for the speedy response, we \nvery much appreciate it. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 21, 2021 2:10 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein Guards/ OIG Report \nThank you, M. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 21, 2021 2:09 PM \nTo: \n> \nEFTA00028699\n\nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein Guards/ OIG Report \nI'm following up internally and will get back to you, or have someone from OIG get back to you. Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 21, 2021 1:46 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: Epstein Guards/ O16 Report \nWe were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the O16 lawyer who is responsible for preparing the \nreport on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with who was previously handling the \ninvestigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by \nclose of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night \nwho have been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOJ-\nO16, and we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we \nexpect would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless DOJ-OIG is \ncomfortable with it. \nI'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient. \nThanks very much, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028700",
