The lawsuit was resolved by \na historic settlement providing for the appointment of a federal monitor for NYCHA, imposing strict \ncompliance deadlines, and obligating New York City to provide billions of dollars to support \nNYCHA's remedial efforts. \n• The Environmental Protection Unit represents the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other \nfederal agencies in a wide range of environmental enforcement matters in this district, \nincluding Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Clean Water Act, and lead-paint \nsafety cases. One significant example is the Office's June 2018 lawsuit against the City of Mount \nVernon for failing to comply with Clean Water Act storm sewer permit requirements designed to \nprevent raw sewage and other illicit pollutants from flowing from Mount Vernon's storm sewer \nsystem into the Hutchinson and Bronx Rivers. \n• The Environmental Protection Unit also brings cases on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand the Food and Drug Administration to protect food safety and eliminate other public health \nthreats. In June 2017, for example, this Office sued to shut down a fish smokehouse that had \nrepeatedly been found to have Listeria bacteria in the facility as a result of recurring violations of \nfood safety regulations. \n• The Environmental Protection Unit also acts to ensure that companies cannot use bankruptcy to \navoid their responsibility for environmental contamination. In July 2019, this Office entered into a \nsettlement in In re Magnesium Corporation, which requires the debtors to pay more than $33 \nmillion for clean-up of a contaminated Superfund site. In addition, in 2014, this Office obtained \nthe largest ever litigation recovery by the government for clean-up of environmental contamination, \nin the Tronox bankruptcy. That settlement included, among other things, more than $4.4 billion for \nenvironmental clean-up and liabilities arising from contaminated sites across the country. \nEFTA00023945\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nCombating the Opioid Crisis \nThe United States faces an epidemic of overdoses and deaths from prescription and synthetic \nopioids. The Office is committed to prosecuting those responsible for fueling this crisis. In addition \nto targeting street-level dealers and their suppliers, the Office has aggressively pursued medical \nprofessionals who divert these highly-addictive pills, including doctors, pharmacies, and a major \ndrug distributor. \n• In April 2019, in the first prosecution of its kind, the Narcotics Unit charged one of the nation's \nlargest drug distributors. Rochester Drug Cooperative, and two of the company's senior executives, \nwith distributing drugs that helped fuel the opioid epidemic.  This case represents the first time \nexecutives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself have been charged with drug \ntrafficking. The charges are a reminder to drug companies and drug distributors of their \nresponsibilities to put public health before corporate profits and to adhere to the highest standards of \nethics and compliance in placing dangerous pharmaceutical products in the marketplace. \nThe Office has also been aggressive in prosecuting \"dirty doctors\" and other medical professionals \nwho have helped to perpetuate the opioid crisis. \n• In October 2018, the Narcotics Unit charged five doctors, one pharmacist. and a physician's assistant \nas part of a coordinated takedown of trusted health professionals who abused their positions to \nillegally sell oxycodone. The case against these defendants is pending. \n• In December 2018, the Unit convicted a Staten Island doctor who prescribed millions of oxycodone \npills to patients whom he knew had no legitimate need for the highly-addictive drug. He is scheduled \nto be sentenced in January 2020. \n• In March 2018, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged five Manhattan based doctors for \naccepting bribes and kickbacks from Insys, a pharmaceutical company, in exchange for prescribing \nSubsys, a potent fentanyl-based spray. To date, four of the five doctors have been convicted; the \nremaining charged defendant is awaiting trial in this case. \nIn addition to pursuing medical professionals, the Office has redoubled its enforcement efforts by \npartnering with the New York City Police Department to establish the Overdose Response Initiative, \nwhich treats every overdose as a crime scene and aims to hold drug traffickers responsible for their \nroles in the opioid crisis. The Narcotics Unit has secured convictions of multiple individuals who \ndistributed drugs that caused overdoses. \nEFTA00023946\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n• In one such case, in December 2018, the Narcotics Unit secured a 25 year prison sentence, following \nthe conviction at trial of an individual who sold heroin that resulted in two overdose deaths. \n• In May 2019, the Narcotics Unit convicted a Staten Island drug dealer who sold fentanyl-laced \nheroin that led to two overdoses, one of which resulted in the death of a 26-year-old man. \nCountering State-Sponsored \nCybercrime \nThe Office has moved aggressively to investigate and prosecute cybercrime cases of national and \ninternational significance. \n• In March 2018, the Complex Frauds 8z Cybercrime Unit unsealed charges against nine Iranians \nassociated with the Mabna Institute, which conducted a massive computer hacking campaign on \nbehalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Mabna Institute is allegedly responsible for \nstealing academic research, intellectual property, and other confidential business information from \n144 U.S.-based universities, 176 universities in 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private \nsector companies, and several U.S. Government agencies, among other victims. The Mabna case was \nthe product of multiple federal and international agencies dedicated work to take down this state-\nsponsored hacking group. Criminal charges were announced in coordination with sanctions imposed \nby the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which designated the Mabna \nInstitute and its hackers for sanctions for conducting malicious cyber activities. \n• In December 2018, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged two Chinese nationals affiliated \nwith the Chinese-sponsored hacking group \"APT10\" with conducting extensive hacking campaigns \non behalf of the Chinese government to steal intellectual property and confidential business \ninformation from more than 45 technology and defense companies. APTio, known as an \"Advanced \nPersistence Threat\" group, compromised data held by managed service providers, firms that other \ncompanies trust to store, process, and protect commercial data, including intellectual property and \nother confidential business information. \n• \nIn March 2016, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged seven Iranian nationals for \nconducting a state-sponsored coordinated series of \"Distributed Denial of Service attacks against the \nU.S. Financial Sector between 2011 and 2013.  The seven defendants were allegedly associated with \ntwo Iran-based cybersecurity companies —  ITSec Team and Mersad —  that operated as fronts for the \nIran government's offensive cyber operations. During the campaign, the defendants leveraged large \nbotnets consisting of thousands of compromised servers around the world to systematically send \nmalicious Internet traffic to servers belonging to 46 U.S. banks, resulting in disabling the servers and \ncosting the banks tens of millions of dollars to remediate. Notably, the indictment separately \ncharged one of the ITSec Team defendants, Hamid Firoozi, with the 2013 compromise of the \nEFTA00023947\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. Had the \nsluice gate (the gate that controls the flow of water released through the dam) not been disconnected \nfrom the system for maintenance, the compromise would have allowed the Iranian government to \nremotely control the operations of the dam. \nProsecuting \nFraud \nThe Office's Criminal and Civil Divisions prosecute fraud on a wide scale. The Criminal \nDivision investigates and prosecutes cybercrime, complex frauds and white collar crimes, and \nsecurities and commodities fraud. The Civil Division's Civil Frauds Unit uses civil enforcement \nstatutes to investigate and prosecute numerous types of misconduct, including financial fraud, \nhealthcare fraud, and program and grant fraud, and in recent years has obtained admissions of \nwrongdoing from dozens of defendants and over $5 billion in recoveries on behalf of the federal \ngovernment. The Civil Frauds Unit and the Criminal Division's \"white collar\" units closely \ncoordinate with each other to maximize the recovery of criminal fraud proceeds and to return \nthat money to victims. \nIn October 2019, Representative Christopher Collins pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to \ncommit insider trading and to making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. Prior to \nhis guilty plea, Collins had represented the 27th District of New York as a member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives.

Representative Collins, Cameron Collins and Stephen \nZarsky are awaiting sentencing. \n• In 2019, the Civil Frauds Unit filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national \npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance. Inc. for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens's \nimproper billings to government healthcare programs. The Office alleged that Walgreens improperly \nbilled the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens \nsought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated \nprices. \n• In 2018, the Criminal Division's Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit pursued significant investment \nfraud cases, including the prosecution of William \"Billy\" McFarland.  McFarland was sentenced to six \nyears' imprisonment for, most notably, fraud in connection with promoting the notorious \"Fyre \nFestival\" that left hundreds of ticket purchasers virtually stranded without food and shelter—not to \nmention entertainment—on the beaches of Exuma, in the Bahamas. \n• In 2018, the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force charged three former employees of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and \nthree executives at KPMG for their \nalleged roles in a scheme to illegally obtain confidential PCAOB information and use it to improve \nEFTA00023948\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nKPMG audit performance. To date, three defendants have pleaded guilty and two defendants were \nfound guilty after trial. The remaining defendant is awaiting trial. \n• In 2018, the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force successfully prosecuted Craig Carton, a \nnationally-syndicated sports talk radio host, for participating in a Ponzi scheme based on the \nsupposed purchase and resale of tickets to Hamilton and other major productions. Carton, who was \nconvicted following a trial, received a sentence of 42 months in prison. \n• In 2017, the Civil Frauds Unit obtained a judgment of over $206 million against the entities formerly \nknown as Allied Home Mortgage Capital Corporation and Allied Home Mortgage \nCorporation (collectively \"Allied\"), in connection with their fraudulent misconduct while \nparticipating in the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\") mortgage insurance program. After a \nfive week trial, a jury found that Allied falsely certified that thousands of high risk, low quality loans \nwere eligible for FHA insurance and submitted insurance claims to the U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development (\"HUD\") when any of those loans defaulted. In the same trial, the Office \nalso obtained a jury verdict, and $25 million judgment, against Allied's President and Chief \nExecutive Officer Jim C. Hodge for his participation in this fraudulent conduct. \n• In 2016, the Civil Frauds Unit obtained a $1.2 billion settlement of a False Claims Act and FIRREA \nlamisulagainstwellsEargillank,L,LABILmiellEarnaxcglitiyo—the largest recovery ever in a \nFederal Housing Administration mortgage fraud case. The Office alleged that, as a participant in the \nFHA Direct Endorsement Lender program, Wells Fargo engaged in reckless underwriting practices \nand intentionally failed to report seriously defective loans to HUD. \n• In 2016, the Office brought important criminal cases in the area of Medicare and Medicaid fraud, \nsuch as 17.S. n. St-did Javed.  Javed was convicted for operating nine pharmacies in the New York City \narea that had submitted more than $8.5 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid for \nprescription drugs that were not delivered to customers. \n• In 2015, the Civil Frauds Unit announced a coordinated $714 million settlement of civil lawsuits \nbrought by the United States and others against the Bank of New York Mellon, in connection with \nallegations that the Bank engaged in fraud and other misconduct when providing foreign exchange \nservices to its customers. The Office's lawsuit alleged that, contrary to representations made by Bank \nof New York Mellon to its clients that the Bank provided \"best rates\" and \"best execution,\" the Bank \nactually gave clients the worst reported interbank rates of the trading day. \nEFTA00023949\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nProtecting Civil Rights \nThe Office is a leader in the prosecution of civil and criminal cases to ensure the protection of civil \nrights for individuals within the District. \n• In March 2019, as part of its continued enforcement work under the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nthe Civil Division's Civil Rights Unit helped secure a partial summary judgment that, if applied going \nforward, would obligate the MTA to install elevators whenever it performs a subway station \nrenovation that affects the station's usability, regardless of cost. \n• In March 2019, the Civil Rights Unit resolved its sixteenth design and construction case under the \nFair Housing Act, by entering into a Settlement Agreement requiring Sutton Manor. a condominium \ncomplex in Mount Kisco  to engage in extensive retrofits to make the individual units and common \nareas of the complex more accessible to residents with disabilities. The Unit resolved a similar suit \nagainst Webster Management in December 2018, and another such suit against Ginsburg \nDevelopment in April 2018. \n• In July 2018, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units obtained the conviction and sentencing of \nNew York State Correction Officers for the brutal beating of inmate Kevin Moore, and for falsifying \nrecords to cover up the beating. \n• In November 2017, the Civil Rights Unit settled a race discrimination lawsuit against the New York \nCity Department of Transportation for a pattern and practice of Title VII violations, requiring the \nCity to pay $1.3 million in damages and revise its promotion policies. \n• In September 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units secured a 30-year sentence for \nBrian Coll, a New York City Correction Officer, following his conviction after a jury trial for beating \nEFTA00023950\n\nPRIORITIES WEBPAGE \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nan inmate, Ronald Spear, to death and for obstructing justice by covering up the true cause of Spear's \ndeath. \n• In August 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units convicted Rodiny Calypso, a New York \nCity Correction Officer, for filing a false report in connection with the assault of a handcuffed inmate \nat Rikers Island. \n• Also in August 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units secured the conviction and jail \ntime for New York State Correction Officer Jeffrey Green, who pleaded guilty to violating the \nconstitutional rights of an inmate by subjecting her to abusive sexual contact. \nEFTA00023951",
