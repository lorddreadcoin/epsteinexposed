Maxwell \nCase Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN \nFiler: \nDocument Number:266 \nEFTA00031690\n\nDocket Text: \nORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice justify \ngranting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 to be \nreasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to \nprepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also \nensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in \nthe interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, \n2021, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office \n(as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest \npossible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an \nearly fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any adjustments \nnecessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government may move in the \nletter for any requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act. (Signed by Judge \nJ. Nathan on 5/3/2021) (See ORDER set forth) (ap) \n1:20-cr-00330-AJN-1 Notice has been electronically mailed to: \nDavid Boies, II \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nLaura A.
