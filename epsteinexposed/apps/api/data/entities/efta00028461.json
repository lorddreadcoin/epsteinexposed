My hope is that we'll be able to get to your office by 11:30, and we can email \nto let you know that we're on our way if that's helpful. Alternatively, if you and would prefer to meet at the FBI, that \nshould be fine, you just may have to wait for a few minutes following the meeting. We can discuss either way this morning \nin person, but the upshot is that we'll meet with you as soon as possible after the meeting. \nthanks, \nOn Oct 23, 2019, at 08:57, Gloria Allred > wrote: \nI will not have a means to communicate with you after 9:30 this morning, because I will be at the F.B.I.

Daniel from my co counsel Marianne Wang's office will also \nbe joining us on the call. Also ,re =, my client who is flying in for victim services will be happy to speak with you, \nbut I have a very tight schedule on Wednesday, because I need to be on a 1 or at the latest 2 P.M. train to D.C. that \nday.
