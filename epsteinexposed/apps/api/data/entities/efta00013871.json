He didn't really call me last time, he called and asked me to call him back. \nTomorrow at 10:30 sounds fine. I just spoke to •and he said that he spoke with the DAG's chief of staff on Tuesday and made very \nclear that we need an answer by Friday. Nothing more since then. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax \n----Original Message--\nFrom: .
