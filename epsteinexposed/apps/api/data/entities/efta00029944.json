If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and \nwe have those files available to produce immediately.

Please \nlet us know if there is a  time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial \nresponses: \n1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to \nthe MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking \nthe MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to \nJudge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC \nlegal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. \n2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a \nnew CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive \nif you would like to provide one for us. \n3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. \n4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, \nsimilar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files \nrecovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized \neach file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data \nshowing when a  particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. \n5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though \nSDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the \nCDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were \nthe subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I \nhave asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. \n6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I \nnote again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that \nwas available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so \nnone is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the \nEFTA00029945\n\nSDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566, though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 \nsearches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so \nthey did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, \nthese images would not have CART numbers. \n7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to \nthem. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Christian Everdell \nSent: Monday, March 29, 2021 2:40 PM \nTo: \n(USANYS) ‹> \nCc: 'Jeff PagIiuca' \n)  < \nSubject: Discovery Issues \nand I.—\n>; \nLaura Menninger c:>• Bobbi Sternheim \nWe write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a \ncall to discuss. \n1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created \n(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have \nnot heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? \n2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and \nmust use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files \non our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please \nadvise which way you would like to proceed. \n3. A number of the emails in the discovery —  over 109,000 —  were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of \nthe attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the \nmissing attachments, if they exist. \n4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 —  that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified \nby a CART number, have metadata that indicates a \"date created\" or \"date last modified\" date in July 2020 or \nafterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original \nmetadata for these files. \nEFTA00029946\n\n5. A number of photographs —  over 6500 —  were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have \n\"date created\" and/or \"date last modified\" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please \nprovide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that \nyou produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. \n6. A number of the audio/visual files —  over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). \nThese fall into the following buckets: \na. SDNY GM SUPP:  these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have \n\"date created\" and \"date last modified\" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was \nseized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. \nb. SDNY005 (October 20  2020 production):  these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that \nwere produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that \nyou produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. \nc. SDNY011 (November 9  2020 production):  these were produced in native form with load files, but do not \nreference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these \nfiles or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original \nmetadata for these files. \n7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that \nintentional or are we missing those documents? \nPlease let us know your responses as soon as possible. \nThanks, \nChris \nChristian R Everdell \nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP \ni   view No \nwww.cohengresser.com \nNew York I  Paris I  Washington DC I \nLondon \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this e-mail may be confidential and/or ptivileged.
