The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program \nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims \nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently \nof the Epstein Estate. \nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent \nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (\"Jordy\") H. \nFeldman (\"Co-Designers\") with input from attorneys representing over 70 victims, the Attorney \nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be \nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the \"Administrator\"), the former Deputy Special Master of the \nSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the \nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of \ntheir September 11th-related exposure. \n\"This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of \npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknowledgment by an independent third party as to \nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,\" said Ms. Feldman. \n\"Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is \ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the \nyears of pain these victims have endured.\" \n\"These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,\" said Mr. \nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs \nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the \nSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fund, among others. \nThe Program provides victims with an attractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is \nspeedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts, \nEFTA00032569\n\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior settlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary \nrequirements. \nImportant features of the Program include: \n1. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by \nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making \nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no \nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim, \nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination. \n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A \nvictim's legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by \nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against \nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals. \n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to \nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submitted, but \nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant's ability to share information with law \nenforcement, or anyone else. \n\"Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September 11th and other similar programs has \nprovided us with invaluable insight into how to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the \nlife-long effects of trauma,\" said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added, \n\"The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the \nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that \nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time \nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/11 community will serve this Program and \nEpstein's victims well.\" \nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information \nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein \nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been \nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by \nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2021. \nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (\"Probate Court\") \non November 14, 2019. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties, \nincluding victims' counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was \npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2020. The final protocol was approved by the \nProbate Court on June 3, 2020. \n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative \ndesign. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is committed to \nprocessing the victims' claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner,\" said Ms. Feldman. \nEFTA00032570\n\nFor more information, visit: www.eosteinvco.com  email ClaimantSeNices(@EosteinVCP.com or call \nthe toll-free helpline at (877) 312-3055. \nEFTA00032571",
