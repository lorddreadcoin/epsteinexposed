In our review of this \ndatabase, we have come across some communications (emails and reports)from private investigators— among others, \nan investigator named Roy Black. We are generally aware that Epstein hired private investigators in connection with a \ncriminal investigation and related civil litigation in Florida. \nWe don't know whether these materials are privileged. Could you possibly confer with the estate attorneys to \ndetermine whether they are asserting a privilege over communications by private investigators? In the meantime, we \nwill stop reviewing the database unless we hear from you otherwise. \nThanks very much, \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct 12, 2020, at 10:53 AM, ) > wrote: \nThanks very much, M. \nEFTA00013258\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, October 12, 2020 10:51 AM \nTo: \n) \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein SW returns \nThe Goldberger hits have been moved out. \nThanks, \n< \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, October 11, 2020 5:14 PM \nTo: \n) \nCc \nSubject: RE: Epstein SW returns \nThat is email address.
