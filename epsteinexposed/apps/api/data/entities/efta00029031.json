We have not interviewed this witness, so we have not confirmed the details about where the abuse \nhappened, who the perpetrator was, or how old she was when it happened. What we do know is (1) she is currently in \n(2) she is a Enational, and (3) according to her lawyer, she recently made a  statement to the Met Police \nreporting some sort of past abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (and not necessarily the full scope of the information she may have \nin connection with our investigation), so we would be open to the possibility of sharing her name with the Met Police if, \nin your view, that was necessary. \nWe are preparing travel paperwork on our end, and will try to get this moving quickly. Thanks so much for your \nguidance on this. \nBest, \nFrom CRM) \nSent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 7:07 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation \n>; \nOne other question. If there is anything that would implicate UK government interests in \nthis witness (other than any connection with witness PA) -  if she was assaulted in \nconnection with a UK gov't function, or was a UK gov't employee, etc. -  that would also be \nhelpful to know. \nFrom: CRM) \nSent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:05 AM \nTo: ) \n<->; \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation \nEFTA00029032\n\nIn speaking with LEGAT colleagues about how to do this without disclosing the witness \nidentity, they said the UK will want to know if the conduct is also a UK crime. So a few \nquestions: \nis the victim a UK national; \ndid the alleged conduct occur on UK soil; \nif the conduct occurred elsewhere, was the perp a UK national and the victim under age (I \nthink it has to be under age 16)? \nAlso, what country is the victim currently in -  England/Wales; Scotland, or N. Ireland (they \neach have their own procedures)? \nDid the victim ever report the conduct to UK law enforcement? \nThx, \nFrom London) \nSent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 6:40 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nc:M\n> \nSubject: Re: SDNY \ninvestigation \nMy apologies.
