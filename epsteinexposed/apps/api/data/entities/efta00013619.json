One question I have, however, is why you say that Judge Davis is a non-starter. I understood that \nhe was ready, willing and able to serve as the attorney representative. If you have had conversations with him and that is \nnot the case, please let me know. \nI will go over the other issues you raise in your email and will look forward to speaking tomorrow. \nThanks —  Jay \n(USAFLS)\" \n10/22/2007 04:40 PM \nTo \n\"Jay Lefkowitz\" \ncc \n\"Acosta, Alex USAFLS \" \n< \nSubject \nEpstein \n(USAFLS)\" \nEFTA00013619\n\nJay, \nThe Judge Davis issue is a non-starter. We've beaten that horse to death. Regarding your contention that \"the attorney \nrepresentative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's hourly rate only for the time he or she spends \nworking to effectuate settlements for the identified women,\" Alex and I agree that paragraph 7C is sufficient, Regarding the \nother points, we have made the following concessions: \n1. Regarding the language concerning a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to litigate multiple trials \nsimultaneously, I have removed paragraph 4 on page 3 of the letter. \n2. Regarding the 150k statutory limit language, I have included a footnote which should satisfy your concern. \n3. Regarding language there may be discovery to test the claims of alleged \"victims\", please see new paragraph \n4 on page 3 which now states as criteria that the firm should have \"Experience litigating against large law firms and high \nprofile attorneys who may test the veracity of the victims' claims.\" \nI have attached the Addendum and the revised letter to Judge Davis. Jay, this needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe \nthat this is as far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB tomorrow, \nTuesday, October 23, 2007. Thanks, \n• \n----Original Message \nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz (mailto: \nSent: Frida , October 19, 2007 4:05 PM \nTo: (USAFLS)\nSubject: Re: \n- \nI have reviewed your proposed language and wanted to raise a few areas of concern. \nFirst, I am not sure why we are not just asking Judge Davis to represent these women. If he is available, that would save \nus a whole additional layer of process. I had thought that was initially the idea. I am not sure why you seem to be moving \nin another direction. \nI also cannot understand why the draft affirmatively requests that J Davis select a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to \nlitigate multiple trials simultaneously. That seems to be directly at odds with the purpose of the agreement, which is to \nfacilitate out of court settlements. Indeed, to the extent any woman were to elect to bring an action against Mr. Epstein, \nshe would not only be free to select any lawyer of her choice, but would be restricted from using the lawyer representative \nin this capacity due to the conflicts of interests that would cause. This part of your proposed language is of signficiant \nconcern to me. \nYour letter also indicates the 150k statutory limit without reference to the pre-existing 50G limit. To be sure, any of the \nwomen are free to seek whatever settlement they want, but given the question that exists about the statutory amount, the \nletter should not state definitely that it will be 150k. \nIn addition, you have omitted a few important items from your proposal. Given that Judge Davis or any other potential \nattorney representative should understand the scope of the work, the language should make clear that there may be \ndiscovery to test the claims of alleged \"victims.\" \nFinally, I think it is important that the attorney representative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's \nhourly rate only for the time he or she spends working to effectuate settlements for the identified women. \nJay \nOri inal Messa e \nFrom: \n(USAFLS)\" \nSent: 10/17/2007 01:58 PM AST \nTo: Jay Lefkowitz \nSubject: RE: \nEFTA00013620\n\n«071015 Special Master Letter2.wpd» Jay. \nHere's our proposed letter to the special master. \n-----Original Message----\nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz [mailto. \nSent: Tuesda October 16, 2007 9:26 AM \nTo: (USAFLS)\nSubject: \nis there a time today we can speak? \nHow about 430 pm? \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
