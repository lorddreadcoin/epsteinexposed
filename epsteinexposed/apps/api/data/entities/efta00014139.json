As we discussed, I have attached the pertinent portion of Mr. Epstein's \nagreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office. \n«Epstein \nAgrmt \nPortion.pdf» \nI also wanted to call to your attention a couple of items regarding the issue of Work Release. During the change of plea, Mr. Epstein stated \nthat he would be working at the Florida Science Foundation, located at 250 Australian Avenue, Suite 1400, that the Foundation had been in \nexistence for a \"couple of years,\" and that he had been working there \"every day\" prior to the plea. The Division of Corporations' \ndocuments show that the Florida Science Foundation was incorporated in November 2007, not a \"couple of years ago.\" The address \nprovided for the \"office\" of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger's office suite, and neither the office building directory nor \nthe office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security guard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned \nknows of the existence of such a business. Mr. Epstein also could not have been working there \"every day\" when he hadn't been in Palm \nBeach County in the past six months. \nI  would appreciate the opportunity to review the work release regulations. If Mr. Epstein truly is eligible for the program, we have no \nobjection to him being treated like any other similarly situated prisoner, but sitting in his attorney's office suite making telephone calls, \nweb-surfing, and having food delivered to him is probably not in accordance with the objectives of imprisonment. Obviously, the decision \nis left entirely within your discretion, but I  wanted to make sure that you had a complete picture before you made that decision. \nThank you again, and have a wonderful 4th of July. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax \nEFTA00014139",
