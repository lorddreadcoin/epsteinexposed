    "text": "\n\nU.S. \nDepartment of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n86 Chambers Street \nNew York, New York 10007 \nJanuary 6, 2020 \nBy Electronic Mail and U.S. Mail \nRoberta A. Kaplan \nKaplan Hecker & Fink LLP \n350 Fifth Avenue, Suite 7110 \nNew York, NY 10118 \nRe: Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Ms. Kaplan: \nI am the Assistant U.S. Attorne (\"AUSA\") who will be handling the request you \ndiscussed with AUSA for certain information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. \nBecause your request seeks information from Department of \nJustice \n(the \"Department\") \nemployees acquired during and as part of their performance of their official duties, your request \nis governed by certain Department regulations—commonly referred to as Touhy regulations—\nwhich, inter alia, prohibit any Department employee from disclosing such information \"without \nprior approval of the proper Department official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this \npart.\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a); see also United States ex reL Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); \n28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq. The \"proper official\" in this case is Geoffrey S. Berman, the United \nStates Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The Touhy regulations provide a set of \nprocedures for \nthe United States Attorney to follow when considering such requests. See 28 \nC.F.R. §§ 16.22(b), 16.24. \nA party seeking to obtain records or employee testimony from the Department must first \nsubmit a written demand. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.22. To assist the United States Attorney in \nevaluating your request, we ask that this demand provide a detailed statement of the information \nsought; the litigation for which you seek this information; the pertinence of the information \nsought to your litigation; and the availability (or absence) of means in that litigation, including \ndiscovery, to obtain the information in question. See id. § 16.22(d). \nThe U.S. Attorney will reach a determination regarding your request in light of the \nconsiderations codified at 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.24, 16.25, and 16.26. Such considerations include, \ninter alia, \"[w]hether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the \ncase or matter in which the demand arose,\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1), and \"[w]hether disclosure is \nappropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege,\" including law enforcement \nprivilege. 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(2). Disclosure will not be made when, inter alia, \"[d]isclosure \nwould violate a statute . . . or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule,\" 28 U.S.C. \n§ 16.26(b)(1), \"[d]isclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant,\" 28 U.S.C. § \n16.26(b)(4), or \"[d]isclosure would reveal investigative records compiled for law enforcement \npurposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative \ntechniques,\" 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(5). Applying these considerations, the Department will make \nappropriate disclosures when warranted. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(c). \nEFTA00010331\n\nPage 2 \nMy understanding is that you may intend to make a formal written request pursuant to the \nabove-described regulations. If you choose to submit a written request, please send it directly to \nme. We will act upon an application made pursuant to the Department's regulations. \nPlease contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to \ndiscuss the issues herein further. \nSincerely, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nBy: \nAssistant United States Attorne \nTelephone \nFacsimile: \nE-mail: \nEFTA00010332",
