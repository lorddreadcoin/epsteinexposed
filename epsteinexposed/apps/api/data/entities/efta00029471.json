The \nMiami Herald reported in November that Acosta and \nanother prosecutor worked with lawyers for \nbillionaire Jeffrey Epstein to keep the public eye off \nthe case and have Epstein charged with state crimes \neven though investigators had gathered evidence of \nan international trafficking scheme. \nThe case has become part of a rallying cry for some \nmembers of Congress who instead want to see such \ninvestigations into potential prosecutorial misconduct \ndone by the DOJ's Inspector General, which is \nindependent from the \nagency. \nThe law currently gives the OIG power to investigate \nalleged misconduct by DOJ employees, except when \nthe claims \"relate to the exercise of the authority of \nan attorney to investigate, litigate, or provide legal \nEFTA00029471\n\nadvice.\" \nIn January, the U.S. \nHouse of \nRepresentativesunanimously passed a bill called the \nInspector General Access Act that would delete that \nexception. \nAt the hearing, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-\nFla., said that while lawmakers on both sides of the \naisle have long supported the concept, the situation \nhas become \n\"urgent.\" \n\"The American people and the victims of these \nhorrific crimes deserve to know why justice was not \nserved in this disturbing case, and the lack of \ntransparency still cloaking it is deeply disturbing,\" \nWasserman Schultz said at the hearing, referring to \nthe Epstein case. \nSince 1975, the OPR has been in charge of fielding \nand investigating complaints against the DOJ's \nattorneys. The office opens full-blown investigations \ninto a fraction of those complaints, ultimately \ndetermining how the incident occurred, be it a \nmistake or willful misconduct. \nIn the past, prosecutors have been suspended or \nreprimanded. In some cases where the OPR has \nfound that the conduct didn't rise to misconduct, \nfindings get reported back to the attorney's \nsupervisor. \n\"If you work in the Justice Department, it is really \nscary to be reviewed by OPR,\" said Jennifer Rodgers, \na former federal prosecutor who now serves on the \nadvisory board at the Center for the Advancement of \nPublic Integrity at Columbia Law School. \nBut sometimes the attorneys the OPR investigates are \nlong gone by that point. According to the most recent \nEFTA00029472\n\nOPR report from 2017, six of the 13 attorneys who \nwere found to have committed professional \nmisconduct in that year had already left the DOJ by \nthe time the investigation concluded. The office \nauthorized reporting most of them to their state bar \nassociations. \nWhile the OPR focuses on individuals, Rodgers said \nthe OIG's mandate is broader and involves putting \nout public recommendations for systemic change \nwithin the DOJ. The OIG already gets to review and \nissue advice on issues that involve other DOJ staff, \nsuch as FBI agents. The bill before Congress would \nput attorneys on the same footing. \n\"This may be the case that pushes that over the line. \nAnd I am OK with that,\" Rodgers said of the Epstein \nmatter. \nThe OPR has also changed over the years. In 2015, \nthe office started documenting whether its findings \nactually resulted in discipline after a recommendation \nfrom the Government Accountability Office. The \noffice also expanded the number of DOJ attorneys \nwho could be reported to bar associations. \nStill, some members of Congress believe the \nInspector General is better suited to the job, pointing \nto the fact that the OPR is not independent from the \nDOJ and has fewer reporting requirements. \nThe Inspector General Access Act is pending before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. Similar bills have \nbeen proposed \nbefore, including one last year by a \ngroup of Republican senators including then-\nJudiciary Committee head Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \nGrassley supports the 2019 bill, his staff confirmed. \nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote to \nCongress in support of the bill in November, saying \nEFTA00029473\n\nas a statutorily independent agency the OIG is better \nsituated to investigate misconduct claims than the \nOPR, which reports to the deputy attorney general. \n\"The credibility of the department's disciplinary \nprocess is inevitably reduced when the responsible \ncomponent operates under the direction of the \ndepartment's senior leadership and is not subject to \npublic scrutiny because of limited transparency,\" \nHorowitz wrote. \nThe OPR does issue an annual report breaking down \nthe number of complaints received and how many \nresulted in action. The vast majority of complaints \npass through the office without further action. In \n2017, 72 of the 636 complaints the OPR received \nresulted in a formal inquiry or investigation. The \nOPR report also gives the outlines of what happened \nin a sample of the cases. \nBruce Green, a Fordham University law professor \nwho writes on prosecutorial misconduct, said the \nOPR's summaries aren't enough to reassure the \npublic, particularly given that the office is overseen \nfrom within the DOJ. \n\"Do \nthey go too easy? Are they too willing to credit \nwhat prosecutors told them? It's hard to know,\" \nGreen \nsaid. \nThe biggest issue is the lack of independence, Green \nsaid. He pointed to the example of John Yoo, the \nDOJ \nattorney in the Bush administration who famously \nauthored memos offering a legal justification for \ntactics such as waterboarding that the CIA used after \nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks. \nThe OPR issued a report in 2009 finding that Yoo and \nJay Bybee, another DOJ attorney, had committed \nprofessional misconduct and recommending they be \nEFTA00029474\n\nreferred to the state bar for discipline. A DOJ official \nvetoed the move, saying the pair had not violated a \nclear standard. \nGreen has written that the advent of digital media \nseems to have initiated a shift towards prosecutorial \naccountability, particularly in the states. However, \nchanging the game for federal prosecutors \nhas proven \nmore difficult. \nHe pointed to laws that were proposed but never \npassed in the wake of the disastrous prosecution of \nformer U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, on \nfederal corruption charges. In that case, the OPR had \nconcluded that two prosecutors had \"engaged in \nreckless professional misconduct\" for not handing \nover certain evidence to the defense. \n\"For a moment in time, there was a push to reform \ndiscovery law. But then it died down,\" Green said. \n--Editing by Kelly Duncan and Alanna Weissman. \nEFTA00029475",
