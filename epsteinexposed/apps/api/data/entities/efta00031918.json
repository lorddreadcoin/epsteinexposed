It is ironic \nthat the government takes this \nposition given that it \ncreated this \nproblem by opposing \nMs. Maxwell's request \nfor an enlargement of \ntime to file a \nnotice of \nappeal to the Court's \ndenial of her Second \nBail Motion. Indeed, \nMs. Maxwell sought \nthe extension to \navoid this very issue. \n(Dkt. 109). The \ngovernment should \nnot now be allowed \nto \nturn that procedural \nsword into a \njurisdictional shield to prevent \nthe Court from \nconsidering the \ninstant \nmotion. \nDivestiture of jurisdiction in the \ndistrict court while an \nappeal is pending is not a \nper sc \nrule. Rather, it is \na judicially crafted rule \nrooted in the interest of judicial \neconomy that is \ndesigned to \navoid confusion or waste of time \nresulting from having the \nsame issues before two \ncourts at the same time. Divestiture of \njurisdiction, therefore, should not \nbe automatic, but \ninstead guided \nby concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether \ninterlocutory appeal of a \n2 \nEFTA00031920\n\ndistrict court's decision regarding bail \n\"divests the court of its control over aspects of the case \ninvolved in the appeal.\" United States v. \nRodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996). Were it so, a \ndistrict court would have no authority to \nremand or modify bail conditions of a defendant \nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bait. Such a rule \nwould detract from, rather \nthan promote, judicial \neconomy and would be unworkable in practice. \nShould the Court believe it does not \nhave jurisdiction to decide the present bail \nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the \nCircuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without \nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this \nCourt's jurisdiction over the \npresent \nbail motion. Should the Court summarily \ndeny the present motion on the merits, \nMs. Maxwell will file a notice \nof appeal and request \nconsolidation of both appeals. \nRenunciation \nof Foreign \nCitizenship is a \nValid \nand \nSignificant Condition of Release \nRelying on a letter from the \nFrench Ministry of Justice, the \ngovernment urges the \nCourt to give \nno weight to Ms. \nMaxwell's agreement to \nrenounce her foreign \ncitizenship. \nBut the \nletter is wrong on the \nlaw and should be \ndisregarded. The letter \nasserts that the loss of \nFrench \nnationality subsequent to the \ncriminal act which the \nperson is alleged to \nhave committed \ndoes not affect the rule \nagainst the extradition \nof nationals, as \nnationality must be assessed \nat the \ntime of commission \nof the offense and not \nat the time of the \nextradition request. As \ndiscussed in \nthe opinion from \nWilliam Julie, French \nlegal counsel \n(attached as Exhibit A), \nthe \ngovernment's assertion is \nentirely incorrect for the \nfollowing reasons: \n• \nThe government's \nargument goes against \nthe letter of the law. \n• \nThe government's \nargument goes against the \nspirit of the law. \n• \nThe government's \nargument is contradicted by \nprecedent and case law. \n(Julie \nOpinion ¶¶ \n6-26). \n3 \nEFTA00031921\n\nThe \nlanguage of the \nextradition treaty between \nthe United States \nand France and the \napplicable French \nstatues are clear that \nanyone seeking to \ncontest extradition on the \nbasis of \nFrench \ncitizenship must be a \nFrench national at the \ntime of the extradition \nrequest. (Id.1 II). \nThe \nprovisions on which the \ngovernment relies \nwere not intended to \napply in cases where the \nperson whose \nextradition is sought had \nlost French citizenship. To the \ncontrary, it was \ndesigned to apply to \nindividuals who had acquired French \ncitizenship subsequent to the \ncommission of the alleged crime \"in \norder to avoid fraudulent nationality \napplications of \noffenders seeking to escape extradition.\" (Id. \nTO 15-16). If the person is no longer a French \nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites \nno case \nwhere the \nrelevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition, \nand we have found none ourselves. (kill 19-21). By contrast, there are numerous examples \nof French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality following the \ncommission of an offense. (Id. ¶ 21). Accordingly, Mr. Julio concludes: \"[I]t cannot have been \nthe intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person \nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be \nprotected from extradition.\" (Id. \n¶ \n26). \nMs. Maxwell's agreement to give up both British \nand French citizenship and waive \nany \nand all right to contest extradition is \na fonnidable challenge to \nthe assertion that Ms. \nMaxwell would likely \nflee if released from custody and \ngoes above and beyond the \n\"reasonable \nassurances\" that the Bail Reform Act requires \nto grant bail. While we \nmaintain that Ms. \nMaxwell's written waivers of the \nright to challenge extradition \nshould \nsuffice, her willingness \nto forfeit citizenship \nbirthrights exceeds what is \nnecessary and \nprofoundly demonstrates her \ncommitment to abide by \nconditions of release and appear \nat \ntrial. \n4 \nEFTA00031922\n\nMonitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant Condition of Relestsc \nTo address the Court's concern about Ms. Maxwell's access to assets, the bail \nmotion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail condition —  the \nimposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and \napprove expenditures. Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the \ngovernment urges the \nCourt to summarily reject the \nproposed monitorship. \nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired \nfederal district court judge and the former United \nStates Attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia, has agreed to undertake \nappointment by \nthe Court as asset \nmonitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience \nevaluating and monitoring \nfunds held in and disbursed from \nfinancial accounts. He has \nagreed to serve by appointment \nof \nthe Court in a capacity \nsimilar to other trustees and receivers \nwho serve as officers of the Court \nand are entrusted, \npursuant to court order, with oversight \nauthority to restrain, monitor, and \napprove disbursement of assets \nrequiring his signature. \nSimilar to others who have \nbeen \nappointed by \ncourts to oversee financial \nmatters, Judge Duffey will be \ncompensated at the same \nhourly rate billed \nfor his services as an \nADR panelist for \nFederal Arbitration \n(FedArb). \nThe \nproceeds from the sale of Ms. \nMaxwell's London home will be \nrestrained and \nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As \nrequired by court order, \ndocumentation concerning \nthe \nproceeds of the \nsale will be provided to Judge \nDuffey and the funds will \nbe deposited in the \nfinancial \naccount approved by \nJudge Duffey. \nThe government tries to steer the \nCourt's attention to allegations of Ms. \nMaxwell's lack \nof \ncandor to dissuade the Court \nfrom considering the proposed \nmonitorship as a meaningful \nrestraint on the \nassets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. \nAs previously stated, despite \nbeing \nquestioned \nby Pretrial Services following a \nperiod of solitary confinement, suicide \nwatch, sleep \n5 \nEFTA00031923\n\ndeprivation, and \nother conditions adverse to \nher physical health and \nmental well-being, Ms. \nMaxwell responded appropriately \nand accurately to questions posed \nby Pretrial Services which \nwere \nrestricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial \ndocuments - collected and \nprofessionally vetted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submitted to the \ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning \nMs. Maxwell's personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid \nchallenge has been made to those submissions. \nThe government challenges \nthe Court by inanely stating that if \n\"the only way to keep \nthe \ndefendant from using her assets to fl\nee is to take away control of \nher assets, then she is too \ngreat a risk \nto release.\" (Dkt.165 at 8.) \nThis statement is \nfundamentally illogical as it \nundermines most \nconditions of release. \nFor example, the \nsame could be said of \nelectronic \nmonitoring — i.e., if the \nonly way to keep \na defendant \nfrom fleeing the \njurisdiction is to \nplace \nhim on home \nconfinement with \nelectronic \nmonitoring, then he \nis too great a fl\night risk to \nrelease.3 The \nCourt should \nreadily dismiss \nthis frivolous \nargument. \nUnder the Bail \nReform \nAct, \nif there \nare \nappropriate \nconditions for release, \nbail should be \ngranted. \nThe conditions \ncollectively proposed \nin the \nprevious and \npresent bail \napplications \nprovide ample \nassurance that \nMs. \nMaxwell will \nbe present at \ntrial. \n3 \nMoreover, in an effort \nto further \nobtliscate the merits of \nMs. Maxwell's \nbail application, \nthe government \ndesperately argues that \nfunds for legal \nservices, presently held in \nattorney escrow \naccounts, would be \nreleased and \nmade available to \nsupport Ms. Maxwell \nas a fugitive. To \nsuggest that defense \ncounsel would \nbecome \naccomplices to a \nviolation of's \ncourt order shows \nutter disrespect for \nMs. Maxwell's \ndefense team. \nIn \nparticular, New York \ncounsel, who have spent \nthe entirety of their \nlegal careers practicing \nin this district \nand \nestablishing well-respected \nreputations among the bench \nand bar, take umbrage \nat the government's \ncallous \nassertion. \n6 \nEFTA00031924\n\nConceded \nProblems Undermine the \nStrength of the Government's \nCase \nAs Ms. \nMaxwell's period of detention \npasses the nine-month \nmark, the government has \ncontinuously upgraded \nMs. Maxwell from a \"plain \n[ \nJ \nrisk of flight\" to a \n\"substantial and \nactual risk of flight\" to a \n\"serious flight of risk\" and \nnow to an \"extreme risk of \nflight.\" (Dkt. \n165 at 1.) \nIronically, her level of flight risk \nincreases as the strength of \ngovernment's case \nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell \nhas challenged the strength of the \ngovernment's case \nin \npretrial motions pending before the \nCourt. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell \nhas \npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement \nentered into by Jeffrey Epstein in \n2007, which \nimmunizes \"any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\" bars Ms. Maxwell's \nprosecution in this \ncase, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are \ntime-barred. \nThe government's response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial \nmotions shines further light \nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the \ngovernment concedes it cannot establish that \neither Ms. Maxwell or \nEpstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-34 to travel while she \nwas a minor or that she was \nunderage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with \nEpstein. \n(See Opp.162-65 & fn. 57-58.)5 Hence, her allegations \ncannot support the conspiracies charged \nin the Indictment, leaving the \ngovernment with only two witnesses to \nprove the charges against \nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the \ngovernment's response, it \nproduced documents indicating that \ngovernment prosecutors misled a federal judge to \nAccuser-3 is identified in the Indictment \nas \"Minor Victim-3.\" \n5 -Opp.\" references are to page numbers of the Government's Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's \nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, \n2021 and not yet publicly flied. \n7 \nEFTA00031925\n\nobtain evidence \nagainst Ms. Maxwell \n(see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. \n4-7) - a shocking \nrevelation that \nundermines the viability of \nthe perjury counts, \nnot to mention the \nintegrity of the entire \nprosecution. \nThe \nongoing review of \ndiscovery confirms the lack \nof evidence in support \nof the \nstale \nallegations in the indictment. \nFurther, the government's \nconcessions reveal that it \nfailed to properly \ninvestigate the allegations of at least \none of its three core witnesses. The \npassage of time continues to reveal information and \nlack of evidence that undermine the \npurported strength of the government's case. \nBail \nMust \nBe Granted \nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on \n25-year-old allegations — based on the lowest grade \nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law \n130.556 — presented in a \nsensationalized \nindictment \ncontaining pictures to inflame the \npublic and entice and feed \nthe media frenzy' — \nis unwarranted in the face \nof the unique bail package \nbefore the Court. Relentless \nmedia \ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, \nwhich preceded and \nimpacted the bringing \nof this prosecution. \nhas increased \nsignificantly since her \narrest and \ndetention. Ms. Maxwell's \ncontinued \ndetention — providing \ndaily fodder for \nmedia for the \npast nine months\n—continues to \nseverely \nundermine \nher presumption \nof innocence. \nIn the face of \nthis enhanced \nbail package, the \ngovernment's claim \nthat Ms. \nMaxwell \nposes \"an \nextreme risk of flight\" \nrings hollow. \nThe government \nurges the \nCourt to apply a \nstandard that \ndefies the law - an \nabsolute guarantee \nagainst all risks. \nSee United States \nv. \nCounts Two and \nFour allege violations of \nNew York Penal Law § \n130.55 - sexual abuse in the \nthird degree - a \nclass B misdemeanor \npunishable by maximum \npenalties of three months in jail or \none year probation. \nWhat other purpose could be served by the inclusion \nof a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken \nover a \ndozen years after the period of the conspiracy \nalleged and pictures of three high-value \nresidences? \n8 \nEFTA00031926\n\nOna, 760, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) \n(\"The legalstandard requiredby the [Bail \nReform) Act is one of \nreasonable assurances, not absolute \nguarantees.\"). Under the Bail \nReform \nAct, Ms. Maxwell must be \nreleased unless there are \"no \nconditions\" that would \nreasonably \nassure her presence. Here, the \nproposed bail package - \nuniquely strengthened \nby Ms. Maxwell's agreement \nto renunciate her foreign \ncitizenship and have assets \nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies \nthe actual governing standard. \nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59\n-year-old \nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made \nAmerica her home for the past 30 years, and who has established strong roots and forged \nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The \nconcerns regarding foreign \ncitizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. \nTo say \nthat \nrenunciation of foreign citizenship and \nstrict monitoring of assets by a \nretired federal \ndistrict court judge \ndoes not suffice when combined \nwith an eight-figure bond secured \nby \nreal property and cash \nand the strictest terms of home \nconfinement and electronic \nmonitoring \nstrains credulity. The \ngovernment gains a strategic \nadvantage each day Ms. \nMaxwell remains in custody — \nher case is tried daily in the \ncourt of public opinion based \non allegations that arc \ninadmissible in a court of law; the \nlikelihood of seating jurors \nwho \narc \nnot implicitly \nbiased against her is being severely \njeopardized; her \nphysical strength \nand concentration \nare becoming increasingly \nimpaired by the conditions of her \nconfinement; and she is being denied \na full and fair opportunity to \nprepare her case for \ntrial.s \n\" Ms. Maxwell continues to experience \ndifficulty reviewing electronic discovery, \nincluding discs that can only be \nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on \nthat computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on \neither the MDC computer or \nthe laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including \npretrial motions, responses and replies \n— are constantly delayed even after tracking information \nconfirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the \n9 \nEFTA00031927\n\nConclusion\nThe Court \nshould grant bail for Ms. \nMaxwell on the \nextraordinary conditions \nproposed. Should the Court \ndetermine that additional conditions are \nnecessary, Ms. \nMaxwell is willing to satisfy and \nabide by those terms as well. \nDated: March 16, 2021 \nRespectfully submitted: \nPat C. \nSt \n:m. \nBobbi C.

The \nrequest was made in the context of ongoing bail \nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America \n(hereafter \"USA\"), \nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial \non charges relating to her alleged role in \nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from 1994 to 1997. \n2. In a previous opinion, I  have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute \nan extradition \nrequest against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the \nUSA and \nFrance, without violating any superior norm of \nFrench \nand international law. \n3. As I understand the defendant's French nationality \ncontinues to be regarded by the Court \nas a  bar to her \nrelease pending trial, I  am informed that the \ndefendant is prepared to \nrenounce French nationality \nunder Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if \nthe Court \nso \nrequires. \n4. a \nletter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2021, the Head of the \nInternational \nCriminal Assistance Bureau of the \nFrench Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe laegle, \nasserts that the loss of \nFrench nationality after the criminal act which the person is \nalleged to have \ncommitted does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, \nas nationality must be assessed at  the time of commission of the offence and not at  the \ntime of the extradition request. \n5. This report was written to \nprovide a  counter opinion on this issue, in support of the \nproposition that the French government \nwould be legally entitled to execute an \nextradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national. \n6. The Ministry \nof \nJustice's assertion must be regarded as incorrect \nfor \nthree \nreasons: \n(i) It is not supported \nby the letter of the law; \n1 \n31, Rue \nAMPERE \n-  75017 \nPARIS - \nTEL. 01 86 \n33 51 80 —  FAX. 01 \n1313 33 \n51 \n81 \nwiatwiavOCAISCOM • s-ww.vellivoCatiLCOM • \nPALMS C1652 \nEFTA00031930\n\nWILLIAM JULIE \nAVOCAT A  LA \nCOUR - ATTORNEY AT LAW \n(ii) Nor is it \nsupported by the spirit of the law; \n(iii) Case law and precedents in fact \nsuggest the opposite. \n7. First, the \nMinistry's interpretation goes against the letter \nof the law. \n8. \nAmerican extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty \nbetween the USA and France of 23 April 1996 (\"the Treaty\") and the French Code of \nCriminal Procedure for matters not dealt with under the Treaty. \n9. Article 3(1) of the Treaty \nprovides: \n\"There is no obligation upon the \nRequested State to grant the \nextradition of a person \nwho is a \nnational of the Requested State, but \nthe executive authority of the \nUnited \nStates \nshall have the power \nto surrender a \nnational of the United States \nif, in its \ndiscretion, \nit deems it proper to \ndo so. The nationality \nof the person sought \nshall be \nthe nationality \nof that person at the \ntime the offense was \ncommitted\". \n10. Article \n696-4 of the \nFrench Code of \nCriminal Procedure \nprovides for \nthe same rule. \nunder \nsimilar \nwording: \n\"Extradition shall not \nbe granted: \n1° When the \nperson claimed \nhas French \nnationality, the latter \nbeing assessed \nat the time \nof the \noffense for \nwhich extradition \nis requested\" \nI I. Under a \nliteral reading of \nthese provisions, \nthe nationality \nprotection only \napplies where \nFrench \nauthorities are faced \nwith an \nextradition request \nagainst a person who \nis a French \nnational at the time \nof the \nextradition request. Both \nthe Treaty and \nthe French Code \nof \nI \nOther relevant \ninternational treaties include: the \nAgreement on \nExtradition between the \nUnited States of \nAmerica and the \nEuropean Union s ivied \nin Washington on \n25 June 2003, and \nthe \nInstalment Amending the \nTreaty of 23 Apnl 1996 \nbetween the United \nStates of Amok a \nand France signed in the \nHague on 30 \nSeptember \n2004. \n2 \n51, RUE \nAmvERE \n• \n75017 RARis tee. \n01 88 33 51 80 — FAX. 01 \n88 33 51 81 \nwjeJwjavocats.com • \nWVAV.WiMocats.com - PALMS C1652 \nEFTA00031931\n\nWILLIAM JULIE \nAVOCAT A  LA COUR - \nATTORNEY AT LAW \nCriminal Procedure \nuse the present tense (\"a \nperson who is a national of \nthe Requested \nState\"/\"the \nperson claimed has French \nnationality\"), which can only \nmean that the \nextradition of a  person is \ndenied when that person is \nin fact a  French national. If \nthe \nperson is no longer a  French \nnational at the time of the \nrequest, the provision does not \napply. \n12. I-lad these provisions been intended to \napply in cases where the person has lost French \nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts \nwould have \nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to \nqualify the national \naffiliation of the requested person. \n13. Furthermore, it  is a  well-known \nprinciple of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions \nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an \nexception to extradition, it  must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application \nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected. \n14. Second, the Ministry's \ninterpretation goes against the spirit of the law \n15. The \nliteral reading of Article 3 of \nthe \nTreaty \nand Article 696-4 of the French Code \nof \nCriminal Procedure is further \nsupported by the fact that these \nprovisions were in fact \nnot intended to \napply in cases where the person sought has \nlost French citizenship, but \nonly in cases where \nthat person has acquired \nFrench citizenship subsequent to the \ncommission of \nthe alleged crime. \n16. In other words, the \nrule that \"nationality shall be \nassessed at the time of the \noffence for \nwhich \nextradition is requested\" seeks to \ndeny the extension of the \nbenefit of French \nnationality to persons who have \nacquired French nationality after \ncommitting an \noffence, in \norder to avoid fraudulent nationality \napplications of offenders seeking to \nescape \nextradition. \n3 \n51.

This concern over \nopportunistic nationality \napplications is precisely the \njustification of \nthe rule mentioned in \nacademic literature (see for example \nRepertoire de droll penal et \nde \nprocedure penale Extradition \nPa. - Conditions de fond \nde l'estradition \nDelphine \nBrach-Thiel-October 2t I 8„f59). \n18. Third, the French Ministry of \nJustice's interpretation is contradicted by \nprecedents \nand case law \n19. The French Ministry of Justice's interpretation finds no \nsupport in case law, as no case \ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the \nFrench Code of Criminal Procedure was applied \nto protect a formerly French national from extradition. \n20. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,1° of the French Code of Criminal \nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against \nan individual who had acquired French nationality after committing an offence, which \nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber \nof the French Cow de \ncaseation on 4 January 2006, n°05-86.258). \n21. Although we have found \nno precedent where French \nauthorities were faced with the \nextradition of a \nperson who had lost French \nnationality, we have found cases where \nFrench \nauthorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had \nlost French \nnationality. Both extradition \nand deportation allow for the removal of a \nperson from \nFrench territory by the \npolice and its surrender to the \nauthorities of a third State, with \nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State. \n22. The \nEuropean Court of Human Rights (the \"ECtHR\") treats \nextradition and deportation \nanalogously. More specifically, the \nECtHR considers that the same human rights bars \napply to all types of removal of a \nperson from the territory of a State party (\"the Court \nconsiders that the question whether \nthere is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article \n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The \nCourt's own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be \nlittle difference between \n4 \n51, \nRUE AMPERE -  78017 PARIS -  TEL. 01 88 33 51 80 —FAX. 01 /38 33 51 81 \nwj@wjavotsta.coon -  www.wjancankcom -  PALAIS C 1852 \nEFTA00031933\n\nWILLIAM \nJULIE \nAVOCAT A  LA COUR - \nATTORNEY AT LAW \nextradition and other removals\", ECtHR 12 April 2012, Babar Ahmad and Others v. \nthe United Kingdom, no. 24027/07, §168). \n23. France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have \nlost French nationality by \napplication of Article 25 of the \nCivil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may \ngive rise to a  deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen \nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of \nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality'. \n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of \nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used \nto be a  French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtIIR specifically prohibits \nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which \nthey remain a national, when there \nis a risk of torture or degrading treatment'. Beghal \nwas eventually deported to \nAlgeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose \nof standing trial. In this case, the French government's decision to deprive Djamel \nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allow for his removal from \nFrance, whether through extradition \nor deportation, as both means of removal were \nconceivable at \nthe time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time \nof the Algerian \nextradition request, he may well have been \nextradited as opposed to \ndeported a \nfew years later, when that risk was eliminated. \n25. In any case, the deportation of \nformerly French citizens shows that the loss of French \nnationality prevents any retroactive \napplication of domestic provisions which are \nintended to protect \nFrench nationals, be it from deportation or extradition. \n2 \nhttps://vnvw.lemonde.fr/societe/anicle/2018/07/16/incertitude-sur-le-sort-de-l-islamiste-cljamel-beghal-qui-sort-\nde-prison•lundi_5332053_3224.html \nECtHR 3 \nDecember 2009.
