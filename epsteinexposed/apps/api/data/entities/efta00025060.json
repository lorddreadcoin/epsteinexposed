You can send me copy of that request once it has \nbeen submitted to the BOP and as a courtesy I will ensure that the correct recipient in the Civil Division of our Office \nhas received it. We do not handle FOIA requests in our division. \nBest, \nOn Oct 25, 2021, at \n12:40 \nPM, wrote: \nHi, \nHope this finds you well. \nI would like to get a copy of ALL of the records that were released to the New York Times on their FOI request \nregarding my brother's case (Jeffrey Epstein). \nPlease advise the quickest way to accomplish this. \nThanks, \nScanned by McAfee and confirmed virus-free. \nEFTA00025061",
