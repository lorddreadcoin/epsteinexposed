    "text": "\n\nPage 1 of I \nEPSTEIN EYES SEX-RAP \nRELIEF \nOctober 9, 2007 -- LAWYERS for Jeffrey Epstein - the billionaire Manhattan \ninvestment manager who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage \nprostitutes at his Palm Beach mansion in exchange for just 18 months in the \nslammer - are mulling asking federal prosecutors to drop their demand that he \nregister as a sex offender. In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S. Attomey \nAlexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein's lawyer, Gerald \nLefcourt, writes, \"Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both \nimmediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly \ninappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life to \naccount for his whereabouts.\" Epstein, a former business partner of Daily \nNews \nowner \nMort \nZuckerman, \npleaded guilty to a state charge in exchange \nfor the feds' dropping their probe into possible federal criminal violations. \nLefcourt argues that only the feds have demanded that Epstein register, \n\"despite the fact that the state was of the view that Mr. Epstein's conduct did \nnot warrant registration?
