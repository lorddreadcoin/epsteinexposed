Thanks. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \"Gadher, Dipesh\" \nDate: Jul 20 2021 at 3:17:20 PM EDT \nTo: \" \n(USANYS)\" \nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell update \nDear Nick \nI hope this email finds you well. Since we last spoke, I've been juggling work with the arrival of a lockdown \nbaby boy - our firstborn - who has left me totally sleep-deprived (and thrilled, of course)! \nI wanted to check a few things with you if I may on the Ghislaine Maxwell case: \nI) Is it correct to say that there will now be TWO trials - the first on the child sex trafficking charges \n(covering the period 1994-2004) and the second on the 2016 perjury charges? \n2) Is the main trial still scheduled to start in November? \n3) Is there any date set aside for the perjury trial? \n4) What does this mean for the maximum sentence that Maxwell can now receive? I think we previously \ntalked settled on up to 80 years behind bars. \n5) Is the investigation into Maxwell and Epstein's network still ongoing? \n6) If so, does Prince Andrew remain a person of interest? Have US prosecutors managed to get a statement \nfrom him yet or are there any arrangements in the pipeline to do so? \nI'd be grateful if you could drop me line with some responses within the next 48 hours if at possible please. \nMany thanks \nEFTA00010139\n\nAll the best \nDipesh \nThe Sunday Times \nTel: \nMob: \n\"Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\" \nThis e-mail and any attachments are confidential, may be \nlegally privileged and are the property of News Corp UK & Ireland \nLimited on whose systems they were generated.
