Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nApril 9, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nMark Cohen, Esq. \nCohen & \nGresser LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East Tenth Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nBobbi Stemheim, Esq. \nLaw Offices \nof Bobbi C. Stemheim \n33 \nWest 19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Counsel: \nThe Government writes regarding your request to review sixteen (16) discs in the \npossession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") as part of the file previously maintained \nby the FBI's Palm Beach Resident Agency (the \"FBI Florida Office\") during its investigation of \nJeffrey Epstein under evidence number 1B8, Subitem 8 (the \"Discs\"). As noted in the evidence \nlog previously provided to you, the Discs are described in the FBI's evidence system as follows: \n(16) DVD-R discs with printed labels reading, \"Palm Beach County \nSheriffs Office Case # 05-250067 Epstein Encase Files Palm Beach \nPD DVD-R for General VERBATIM DVD Computer Crimes \nUnit.\" Each disc is also respectively labeled, \"Disk 1 of 16,\" \"Disk \n2 of 16,\" \netc. \nWhen the FBI's New York Office first received the FBI Florida Office's file regarding its \ninvestigation of Jeffrey Epstein, the agents working on this case attempted to review all electronic \nmedia contained in that file, including the Discs. During that review, the case agents were unable \nto open any files contained on the Discs and believed that the files were inoperable. \nEFTA00015823\n\nPage 2 \nIn preparing for defense counsel in this case to review all physical evidence in the FBI \nFlorida Office's file, the Government tried to access the content of these Discs and was similarly \nunable to open those files. However, the Government recognized that the file extensions and sizes \nof those files appeared to be consistent with those of a  forensic image of an electronic device. \nWith the help of an FBI computer specialist, the Government has learned that the Discs appear to \ncontain a  forensic image of a computer seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residence in Palm Beach, \nFlorida by the Palm Beach Police Department during the execution of a search warrant in or about \n2005 (the \"Epstein Computer\"). \nThe Government has reviewed the 2005 search warrant obtained by the Palm Beach Police \nDepartment, which was previously produced to you in a discovery production dated October 20, \n2020. While that warrant appears to have authorized the seizure of electronic devices, it does not \nappear to have authorized a search of the content of such devices. Moreover, the Government is \nnot aware of any further warrant obtained by local or federal authorities as part of the prior Florida \nInvestigation that would authorize a review of the contents of the Epstein Computer. Nor has this \nOffice obtained a  warrant for the Epstein Computer. Accordingly, the Government does not \nbelieve it  has a  lawful basis to review the forensic image of the Epstein Computer contained on \nthe Discs. Moreover, and given, among other things, the passage of time since the Epstein \nComputer was seized in 2005, the Government does not intend to obtain a warrant to search the \nEpstein Computer or otherwise review or make use of its contents. \nAs such, because the \nGovernment lacks authority to review their contents, the Discs are not discoverable in this case, \nand the Government cannot permit you to review the contents of the Discs.' \nVery truly \nyours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nIn this respect, the Government is also mindful of the fact that Epstein's estate has repeatedly \ninformed the Government that it is unwilling to waive any attorney-client privileges in connection \ndevices seized from Epstein during this investigation. As a result, even assuming the Government \nhad the authority to review the contents of the Discs, the Government would have to first conduct \na privilege review before producing any non-privileged material to you. However, because the \nGovernment has no lawful authority to search the contents, it cannot conduct such a review. \nEFTA00015824",
