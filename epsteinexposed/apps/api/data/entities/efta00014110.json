    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of Florida \nDELIVERY BY \nELECTRONIC MAIL \nRoy Black, Esq. \nBlack Srebnick Koms an & \nStumpf P.A. \nMiami, FL 33131 \nRe: \nJeffrey Epstein \nDear \nRoy: \nWest Palm Beach, FL 3340! \nFacsimile: \nNovember 24, 2008 \nOn Thursday I  learned that Mr. Epstein applied for and was admitted to the Palm \nBeach County Sheriff's \nOffice's work \nrelease \nprogram and that he has been on work \nrelease \nfor the past few weeks. For the following reasons, the Office believes that Mr. Epstein's \napplication to and participation in the work release program is a material breach of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement. Accordingly, the United States demands that Mr. Epstein withdraw \nhis application to \nparticipate \nin the \nprogram and \ncomplete his eighteen-month term of \nimprisonment in accordance with the Non\n-Prosecution Agreement. \nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement provides that Epstein \"shall be sentenced to \nconsecutive terms of twelve (12) months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, \nwithout any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and probation or \ncommunity control in lieu of imprisonment.\" I  have more than a dozen e-mails between \nmyself and Jay Lefkowitz discussing the U.S. Attorney's insistence on eighteen months of \nincarceration. \nYou will recall that at one meeting you and Ms. Sanchez raised the idea of Mr. \nEpstein hiring Sheriff's Deputies to guard him as equivalent to imprisonment. Mr. Acosta \nspecifically rejected that suggestion. It is our understanding from the Sheriff's Office that \nMr. Epstein is paying \noff\n-duty Sheriff's Deputies to guard him while he \"works\" at Mr. \nEFTA00014110\n\nRoy BLACK, ESQ. \nNOVEMBER 24, 2008 \nPAGE 2 OF 4 \nGoldberger's office building \neach day. \nAs you remember, shortly \nbefore Mr. Epstein's change of plea, Mr. Goldberger sent \nme a copy of the proposed plea agreement with the \nstate. On June 27, 2008, I sent a letter \ncontaining the \nfollowing language to you and Mr. Goldberger: \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office hereby provides Notice that the proposed sentencing \nprovision does no comply \nwith the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. \nThe second sentencing paragraph of the proposed plea agreement \nreads: \nOn 08CF00938 1 AM B, the \nDefendant is \nsentenced to \n18 \nmonths \nCommunity Control \nI (one). As a special condition of this \nCommunes \nControl, the Defendant must serve \nthe first 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility . \nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement specifically \nprovides: \nEpstein shall be sentenced to consecutive terms of twelve (12) months and six (6) \nmonths in county jail for all charges, .. . without probation or community control in \nlieu of imprisonment. \nThus, the proposed plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office does not comply \nwith the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. To comply with the Agreement, \nMr. Epstein must make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment,\nwhich means \nconfinement twenty-four hours a day at the County \nJail, and the \njudge \nmust accept that recommendation. Community control must follow that term of \nincarceration. \n(Emphasis in \noriginal.) \nAs I specified in that letter, the Non-Prosecution Agreement calls for \"confinement \ntwenty-four hours a day.\" In response to that letter, Mr. Goldberger agreed that he would \nrevise \nthe \nstate plea \nagreement to include the \nword \n\"imprisonment\" to \nmake clear \nthat Mr. \nEpstein would be incarcerated for the full eighteen months and would change the language \nof the state agreement to match the language of the federal agreement. Mr. Goldberger and \nI also discussed the \nsituation and he made \nclear that Mr. \nEpstein would not be \nasking for or \nreceiving work \nrelease and would remain in jail \"around the clock.\" \nIn \nearly August, and I raised the same issue with you when we \nheard \nEFTA00014111\n\nROY \nBLACK, ESQ. \nNOVEMBER 24, 2008 \nPAGE \n3 Or 4 \nthat Mr. \nEpstein was considering applying for work release. On August 6, \n2008, Ms. \nand I  had a conference \ncall with you wherein you again stated that Mr. Epstein \nwould not apply for or receive work release and \nwould spend his eighteen months \nincarcerated twenty-four hours a day at the Palm Beach County Stockade. \nIn preparation for this letter, I  obtained a certified copy of Mr. Epstein's state court \nfile. On June 30, 2008, on the procurement of minors charge, Judge Pucillo entered the \nfollowing sentence: \nThe defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Sheriff of Palm \nBeach \nCounty, Florida for a term of 6 mos. It  is further ordered that the Defendant \nshall be allowed a total of 1  days [sic] as credit for time incarcerated prior to \nimposition of this sentence. It is further ordered that the composite term of all \nsentences imposed for the counts specified in the order shall run consecutive \nto the \nfollowing: \nSpecific \nsentences: 2006CF9454AXX. \n. . . the following \nprovisions apply to the sentence imposed: . . . Followed by \na  period of 12 mos on community \ncontrol I   under the supervision of the \nDepartment of Corrections . . .\n. \nAs I  learned on Friday when I  received the state court file, you neglected to inform \nour Office that, on July 21, 2008, Judge McSorley modified the judgment nunc pro \ntune \nto \nan \"Order of Community Control I.\" This same language was the basis for the objection in \nmy letter of June 26, 2008 and directly contradicts the language of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement. I  also note that, on the state plea agreement, Mr. Goldberger did not insert the \nword \"imprisonment\" as agreed prior to the change of plea, instead the words \"jail sentence\" \nare \nincluded. \nThe \nOffice's Agreement not to \nprosecute \nMr. Epstein was based upon its \ndetermination that eighteen months' incarceration (i.e., \nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) \nwas \nsufficient \nto satisfy \nthe \nfederal interest in \nMr. \nEpstein's crimes. \nAccordingly, the U.S. \nAttorney's Office \nhereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day for the eighteen-month \nEFTA00014112\n\nROY BLACK, ESQ. \nNOVEMBER 24, 2008 \nPAGE 4 OF 4 \nterm \nof imprisonment. \nThe United States will exercise any and all rights it  has under the \nNon-Prosecution Agreement unless Mr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his \nbreach of this Agreement. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited States Attorne \nB \ncc: , Chief, Northern Division \nAssistant United States Attorney \nEFTA00014113",
