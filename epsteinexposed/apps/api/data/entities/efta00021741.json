I \nonly marked an entry as non-responsive if we received nothing from the entity. For instance, if we received a  letter stating \na lack of records, that was still marked as yes. So for any entry labeled \"No\", we received nothing. If you have any records \nwe are missing please send them over, and if we have any outstanding subpoenas the AUSAs are hoping you can check in \nwith the entities. \nLet me know if you have any questions, or if I can be of any help. \nThanks, \nAndy \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 25, 2019 6:51 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Subpoena Contact \n1030 works.
