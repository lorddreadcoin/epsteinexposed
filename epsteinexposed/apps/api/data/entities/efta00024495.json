So the answer is that I unfortunately don't currently have an \nindependent memory of it. However, reconstructing the communications, it looks like at 4:50 p.m. connected us \nwith SSA of C-19, via email. At 5:15 p.m., sent an email to me, and saying it was nice \nspeaking with us and thanking us for offering assistance in the investigation, and copying his agents on the case \nand =). Then at 5:59 p.m., I sent an email to those agents copying you as their point person. \nI don't remember whether I actually spoke with the line agents, =, or some combination of both, but I think it's most \nlikely that we spoke with , given email at 4:50, email to the three of us at 5:15 referring having \nspoken with us, and my email to about the info from C-19 at 5:34. The originals of those emails are all attached. \nLet me know if any other info would be useful? And I'm sorry I didn't recall this when we talked on the phone earlier. \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 13, 2020 18:57 \nTo: \nSubject: FW: RE: for the AUSA handling \nthe new investigation \n> \nDo you have any record/memory of who from C-19 told you this? \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, July 13, 2020 6:52 PM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: RE: for the AUSA handling \nthe new investigation \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:34 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: for the AUSA handling the new investigation \nWe just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current /  latest \ngirlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from \nher lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It \nsounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new \ninvestigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate. \nthanks, \nEFTA00024495\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern \nDistrict of New York \nEFTA00024496",
