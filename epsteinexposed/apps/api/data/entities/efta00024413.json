Because of the scheduling issues I mentioned, we'd like to set it for a time in early \nSeptember, if we can —  is there a time during the afternoon of September 5 or the morning of September 6 that would \nwork for you? We should be able to do either of those dates and times. Or if not, we can propose possible times the \nfollowing week. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nMoyne, Parvin \nSent: Tuesday, August 20, 2019 14:03 \nTo: \n< >; \n) \nCc: Moyer, Thomas \nSubject: RE: 2019.8.15 - SDNY Production Index.xlsx \nInitially, we propose that the lawyers (myself, my colleagues at Akin Gump, and someone from DB Legal) deliver a \npresentation that provides an overview of Epstein's relationship with the bank, the different accounts affiliated with \nEpstein and the types of transactions found in the accounts. We would also highlight various transactions that we have \nnoted in our internal investigation. Our aim is that the attorney proffer would help you in sifting through the records we \nhave provided so you can more readily identify whatever information you are most interested in. Following the proffer, if \nthere are particular accounts or transactions of interest, we can identify the person within DB who can best answer \nquestions on those areas and that person would then meet with you. \nIn terms of timing, I estimate 2-3 hours for the attorney proffer. (I think closer to 2 hours but I hate to underestimate.) \nBest, \nParvin \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 19, 2019 8:14 PM \nTo: Moyne, Parvin \nCc: Moyer, Thomas \n< \nSubject: RE: 2019.8.15 - SDNY Production \nIndex.xlsx \nEFTA00024413\n\nParvin, \nCould you please let us know what format we should expect in terms of the proffer? That will help us with figuring out \nscheduling. I.e., do you expect to make an attorney proffer in the first instance, or should be expect to be meeting with \nDeutsche Bank personnel, etc? And approximately how long should we be planning to block out? \nthanks, \nFrom: \nMoyne, Parvin \nSent: Monday, August 19, 201912:04 \nTo: \nCc: Moyer, Thomas \nSubject: RE: 2019.8.15 - SDNY Production Index.xlsx \n<->: \nHi — \nThe proffer may be helpful in guiding you through the production. That said, we can be available whenever makes most \nsense on your ends. \nWe have time this week (Thursday or Friday afternoon) and next week (Monday —  Wednesday), and we have time in \nSeptember. If you give us a few options in terms of dates/times, we will sort out schedules on our ends. \nBest \nParvin \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 1:59 PM \nTo: Moyne, Parvin \nCc: Moyer, Thomas \nSubject: RE: 2019.8.15 - SDNY Production Index.xlsx \n**EXTERNAL Email** \nParvin, \nWe received the index, thank you. In terms of a proffer, what generally did you have in mind regarding timing? I think \nwe'd like to have some time with the subpoena returns to get familiarized, and our team has a  combination of travel and \ntrials in the next couple weeks, but we could do early September if that works on your end. Thoughts? \nthanks, \nFrom: \nMoyne, Parvin \nSent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 09:48 \nTo: \ncE> \n1.S \n) \n<->: \nEFTA00024414\n\nCc: Moyer, Thomas \nSubject: 2019.8.15 - SDNY Production Index.xlsx \n& \nPlease find attached an index to our productions to date. This is a work in progress — we will update it as we gather and \nproduce additional documents. \nWould you like to touch base later today about scheduling a proffer?
