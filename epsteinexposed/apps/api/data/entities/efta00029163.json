I'm going to be on leave for the next two weeks, so I probably won't send your \ncomments to until I'm back —  so no rush at all. I've attached the latest version, just so you have the most \nrecent one. Thank you so much for your help on this case! \nI do know — he's really fantastic. I used to work with him at Civil Appellate, and he's talked a lot about how great \nhis clerkship was. Small world! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, August 20, 2021 5:40 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Draft RTC \nGot it, thank you. I'm so sorry for the delay in feedback. I did a quick scan a while back and thought it looked great, but \nwill do a closer read and get any comments to you by the end of next week (and you can blame me if you raise them with \nthe PC Chiefs!). Thanks for all of your great and hard work on this case. \nP.S. Do you know He asked me if I knew you a while ago, but I forgot to reach out about it.Mnd I both \nclerked for the same judge. He is wonderful. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursda Au_• ust 19 202110:52 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Draft RTC \nHi\nNo problem. I sent it to the PC Chiefs yesterday, and it's headed toMfter that. We aren't filing it until November, \nthough —  we just want to have it out of the way, as we turn to MILs. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, August 19, 2021 5:25 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Draft RTC \nThanks, So sorry — could you please remind me when you're sending this to the PC Chiefs and when you're \nsupposed to file it? Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Frida Au • ust 6  2021 7:29 PM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: Draft RTC \nEFTA00029163\n\nI hope all's well! Draft RTC in Maxwell attached. The team is going to have comments, I'm sure, as will the chiefs. If you \nlike, I can send you wherever we land. And, of course, I'd welcome any comments you might have too, as an expert on \nthis. \nFrom: \nSent: Frida Au ust 6  2021 7:28 PM \nSubject: Draft RTC \nHi all, \nAttached is a draft RTC for your review. I've left in some comment bubbles to flag some of the judgment calls, and I'm \ngoing to clean up the cites/do a citecheck. \nLooking forward to your comments. \n..hanks \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00029164",
