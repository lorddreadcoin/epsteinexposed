Items \nto Be \nSeized \nA. \nEvidence, Fruits, and \nInstrumentalities of the Subject Offenses \nThis warrant \nauthorizes the seizure of certain evidence, \nfruits, and instrumentalities of \nviolations of Title 18, \nUnited States Code, Sections 1591 (sex \ntrafficking of minors), and 371 (sex \ntrafficking conspiracy) (the \n\"Subject Offenses\") described as \nfollows: \n1.

Any nude, partially nude, \nor sexually suggestive photographs of individuals \nwho \nappear to be teenage girls, or younger; \n4. Motion pictures, fi\nlms, videos, and other recordings \nof visual or written depictions \nof minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § \n2256(2); \n5. Records or other \nitems that evidence ownership, \ncontrol, or use of, or access to \ndevices, \nstorage media, and related electronic equipment used to \naccess, transmit, or store \ninformation relating to the \nSubject Offenses, including, but not \nlimited to, sales receipts, \nwarranties, bills for Internet access, handwritten notes, registry entries, configuration files, saved \nusemames and passwords, user \nprofiles, e-mail contacts, and photographs; \n6. \nAny child erotica, defined as suggestive visual \ndepictions of nude minors that do \nnot constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). \nB. Review of ESI \nLaw enforcement personnel (including, in addition to law enforcement officers and agents, \nand depending on the nature of the ESI and the status of the investigation and related proceedings, \nattorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the government in \nthis investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) will create a forensic \nimage of the Subject Devices (if practicable) and review \nthe ESI contained therein for information \nresponsive to the warrant. \nIn conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to \ndetermine which files or other EST contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such \ntechniques may include, for example: \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00020132\n\n• surveying \ndirectories or folders and \nthe individual files \nthey contain (analogous \nto \nlooking at the \noutside of a file cabinet for \nthe markings it contains and \nopening a drawer \nbelieved to contain \npertinent files); \n• \nconducting a file-by-file \nreview by \"opening\" or \nreading the first few \"pages\" of \nsuch \nfiles in order to \ndetermine their precise contents \n(analogous to performing a \ncursory \nexamination of each \ndocument in a file cabinet to determine its \nrelevance); \n• \n\"scanning\" storage areas to discover and \npossibly recover recently deleted \ndata or \ndeliberately \nhidden files; and \n• performing electronic \nkeyword searches through all \nelectronic storage areas to \ndetermine the existence and \nlocation of data potentially related to the \nsubject matter of \nthe investigation6; and \n• \nreviewing metadata, system information, \nconfiguration files, registry data, and any \nother \ninformation reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was \nused. \nLaw \nenforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for \nfiles, \ndocuments, or other electronically stored information within the \ncategories identified in Section \nII.A of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are \nauthorized to conduct a \ncomplete review of \nall the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its \ncontents and to locate all data responsive to the warrant. \n6  Keyword searches alone are typically inadequate to detect all \nrelevant data. For one thing, \nkeyword \nsearches work only for text data, yet \nmany types of files, such as \nimages and videos, do \nnot store data as \nsearchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there \nmay be information properly \nsubject to seizure but that is not \ncaptured by a keyword search because the \ninformation does not \ncontain the keywords \nbeing searched. \n2 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00020133",
