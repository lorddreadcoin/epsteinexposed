Like me, Dan Kamensky \nnever had a chance going up against the Mogilevich Bag Man Milken flunkie degenerate crew. \nPhat Leon Black: Apollo as I have previously stated: very high on the SEC/Dal \"Do Not Investigate List\". Milken's \n\"right hand man at Drexel\". Black, his family/Apollo controlled the ONLY Epstein SEC disclosed money \nEFTA00019148\n\nlaundering shell called Environmental Solutions World Wide (ESWW). \nIn 2002 the SEC brought a complaint against ESWW: Fraud. With money laundering flags too numerous to \ncount. But, in typical SEC Cover up mode: no AML complaint. \nhttps://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleasesnr17673a.htm \nEnvironmental Solutions Worldwide, Inc. et al.: Lit. Rel.

But, Phat Leon, his family, Apollo didn't just own ESWW stock, they controlled the company \nhttps://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/company-officers/ESWW.PK \nStock Quote News - Stock Market Quotes, \nOnline Stock Quotes, India \nReuters India provides latest news & articles on stock market \nquotes, online stock quotes, India. Get India stock market quotes, \nstock quote news india, latest share prices for ESVVVV.PK \nin.reuters.com \nThe SEC kept ESWW up and running for 13 years AFTER it filed its complaint while Black/his \nfamily/Apollo/Epstein laundered millions of dollars through this SEC declared \"scam\". In the end, ESWW wasn't \neven revoked. Rather: voluntarily withdrawn. \nhttps://www.sec.govicgi-bin/browse-edgar? \nactionrgetcompany&C I K=0001082278&ownerexc lude&count=40&hidefilings=0 \nEFTA00019149\n\nThe ESWW CEO/Chairman was a guy named Mark Yung \nDually employed at a firm called Orchard Capital while at ESWW \nOrchard was controlled by Richard Ressler.

He never had a chance. Kamensky was an outsider in a process only available to Milken flunkie \ndegenerates. ESWW: a money laundering OTCM shell. Leon Black? His family? Apollo? Epstein? Yes SDNY \nand grossly corrupt SEC: Junk is junk. Milken is the nexus of ALL of it. Obviously, Pm not in the inner circle \neither Mr Kamensky. I blew the whistle on a massive, SEC facilitated fraud on the public that is very much \nongoing. The SEC has KNOWINGLY used the SDNY courts to perpetuate this massive fraud prosecuting some \nwhile corruptly and criminally obstructing prosecution of KNOWN criminals. AND screwing those who blow \nthe whistle and dare challenge: Dan Kamensky and Chris \nDilorio. \nHappy Friday! \nChristopher J \nDilorio \nWhistleblower \nFrom: Chris Dilorio \nSent: Monday, May 6, 2019 6:38 AM \nTo: \nEFTA00019150\n\n<sabellac@sec.gov> \nSubject: Fw: Apollo/ Epstein/Kushner connection \nGreetings grossly corrupt SEC et al scumbags \nAs with ALL of my allegations: beyond a shadow of a doubt, 100% accurate \nhttpsWwww.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17673.htm \nComplaint: SEC v. \nCOMPLAINT.
