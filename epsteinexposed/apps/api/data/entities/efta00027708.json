I don't know if we listed a statute in our \nsubpoena that would trigger the mandatory non-disclosure provision USVI was able to rely on, but if we listed money \nlaundering that would get us there. \nAs for the documents we received pursuant to subpoena, I don't really see a basis to push back on that, but let me know if \nyou disagree. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 2:31 PM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nCc: \nSubject: Re: Epstein accounts \n< \nRefreshing this — please let us know?

I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient \nway to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to \ndiscuss anything. \nEFTA00027708\n\nDeutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in \nconnection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and \nothers. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a \ncopy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and \nour production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with \ncontact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request. \nBest, \nParvin \nParvin Daphne \nMoyne \nAKIN GUMP \nSTRAUSS HAUER & FELD ALP \nDirect: \nInternal: \nThe information contained in this e-mail message is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the \nrecipient(s) named above.
