Apparently he represents a victim (I think named \nMrs.-) \nof a CFU defendant of yours, \nand he's been trying to get in touch with you. He's been very helpful in arranging victim interviews for us, so I agreed to \nreach out. Mind if I send an email putting the two of you in touch? \nThanks! \nEFTA00023665",
