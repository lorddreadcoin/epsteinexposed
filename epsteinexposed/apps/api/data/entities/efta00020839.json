And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because \nthe FBI case file is also huge. \nIf going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to \nprovide guidance on that. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, February 21, 2020 17:04 \nTo: \ncj\nCc: \nSubject: Re: Epstein search materials for upload and privilege \nreview \nMoving may be an issue, PAE had trouble releasing the data because they were so voluminous. \nEFTA00020839\n\nOn Feb 21, 2020, at 4:55 PM, \n)< \nwrote: \nAh, possibly it's the \"2020-01-23\" folder under Subpoena Returns?

Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by (copied \nhere)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once \nthe materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will \nalso be coming shortly.) \nAnd then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with \nEpstein search warrant returns. \nPlease let us know if any questions or issues at all?
