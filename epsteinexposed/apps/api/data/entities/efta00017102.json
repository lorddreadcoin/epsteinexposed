    "text": "\n\nContact: Gloria Allred \nEmail: \nStatement of Jane Doe \nPhone: \nI was a model in another country when I came to the United States. I was \ntold by a  booker that I needed to meet with a man named Jeffrey Epstein who \nwas the owner of Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could \nhelp me get into the Victoria's Secret world. It was my childhood dream to be a \nVictoria's Secret model. So I went one day in the afternoon and met Mr. Epstein \nin his office in his mansion in New York. \nA woman introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be \nextremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would probably have \nphotographers shooting photos of me right away. The woman told me to go \nupstairs and directed me to Jeffrey Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe \non and we chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he didn't even \ntake a look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got close to me. I got up to \nleave, but the door was locked. I didn't know what was going on. It was my first \nofficial meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a young girl and confused. \nHe got very close to me and I had a skirt on. He started to \n1l1'acr\nEFTA00017102\n\nAt that point I ran to the door again and figured out \nhow to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was going and she said \nto be careful. She said that Mr. Epstein knew a  lot of powerful people, including \nBill Clinton, and that if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to \nhave any job in the industry. I was so scared, I couldn't wait to get out of there \nand I left. I took the train home. I had spent all of my savings getting Victoria's \nSecret lingerie to prepare for what I thought would be my audition, but instead it \nseemed like a  casting call for prostitution. I felt like I was in hell. \nJANE DOE \nREPRESENTED BY ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED \nAUGUST 27, 2019 \n21 \na\nEFTA00017103",
