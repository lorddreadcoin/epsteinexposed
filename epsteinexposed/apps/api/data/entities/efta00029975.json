I think it will be fairly easy and \nquick for me to burn two password-protected discs containing the iPhone images, so if you are okay with me doing so, I'll get started \non that. If we produce the PAE drive and the password-protected disc, I'll change the language in the cover letter (defense's is \nattached) to reflect that. \nBelow is the chart detailing the Seventh Production, both for your review: \nMr \nProduction 7 (November 18, 2020) \nBates Start Bates End Summary Description Confidential Designation \nSDNY_GM_00536837 SDNY_GM_00869725 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 01 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_00869726 SDNY_GM_01216165 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 02 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_01216166 SDNY_GM_01546512 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 03 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_01546513 SDNY_GM_01964992 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 04 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_01964993 SDNY_GM_02292245 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 05 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_02292246 SDNY_GM_02678243 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 06 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_02678244 SDNY_GM_02735320 \nSDNY_PROD015 - PART 07 (Search Warrant \nReturns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_02735321 SDNY_GM_02742042 SDNY_PROD016 (Search Warrant Returns) Confidential \nSDNY_GM_02742043 SDNY_GM_02742043 NYCO24318 1B71 (iPhone, images pt. 2) Confidential \nThanks so much! \nFrom: \n<> \nSent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 2:00 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \n[Contractor] <> \nSubject: RE: PAE drive copy \nPlease give it a new bates stamp, thanks! \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nc \nSent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 1:59 PM \nTo: \n<a' \nSubject: RE: PAE drive copy \nI was just emailing you about this, actually!

PAE is going to make us another copy for us to keep at 1SA. \nSo please tell that he can stop copying the defense drive. \nWould you please put together a  cover letter for the defense for this production? \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] <> \nSent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 12:35 PM \nTo: \nII*c> \nSubject: RE: PAE drive copy \nAs an update, the PAE drive that will be delivered to Maxwell is ready to go at my desk. The password is WO-6290_20201104 and, if \nneeded, I can prepare a cover letter containing the password to be included separately from the drive. \nI've given the other PAE drive to to start making an internal copy for us. Given the large size of data and massive amount of \nindividual file paths on that drive, he estimates it will take a couple days to make the copy. If a delay in getting the drive to defense is \nan issue, we can connect with and see if there is another solution. \nThanks so much! Happy to chat more about this if needed too, \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nSent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 11:38 AM \nTo: \n11 \nSubject: PM drive copy \nHi \nThis is not time sensitive, so no rush on this at all, but I was going to have make a copy of the PAE drives for us at some point this \nweek. When you have a moment, please let me know if you're not using one of the drives and (if it's here in the office) I'll give the \ndrive to to copy for our internal use. \nThanks so much! \nEFTA00029976\n\nParalegal Specialist \nU.S. Attorney's Office I SDNY \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nOffice: \nCell: \nEFTA00029977",
