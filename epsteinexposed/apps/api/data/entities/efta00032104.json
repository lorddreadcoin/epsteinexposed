One we get an estimate from PAE, if it's longer than a few weeks to process, we \ncan go back to BRG and get an estimate on just processing (without extraction) and see what they say. I would guess it \nwould be something like a couple weeks. \n(As you can probably tell, I'm trying to catch up on emails from earlier this week!) \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, July 08, 2020 18:29 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nDo we know how long it would take BRG to do the processing? \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 8, 2020 5:56 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nThat's partially right but not completely —  the BRG estimate is for dumping the devices but *also* processing all the data. \nThat is, converting all the Word, Excel, PDF, JPEG, BMP, PPT, etc etc files into a loadable file set for Relativity (specifically, \nconverting to TIFF and load files that can be uploaded). \nThat intermediate step is something that the FBI had told us they would do, but now are not doing, because they screwed \nit up so badly last time. So ordinarily we have PAE do the processing, but if they say it will take, say, three months, we can \ndo it faster through BRG. \nEither way we'll review in Relativity, though. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, July 08, 2020 17:52 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nI thought the role we wanted BRG to play was the dumping of the devices — I had thought, perhaps incorrectly, that we \nalways planned to use Relatively to review once we were into them.

In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of \ninformation we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any \ndevice that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the \nfollowing devices — \nThe two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) \nThe two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) \nthe following loose storage devices: \no Micro SD card (NYCO24339) \no  Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) \no  Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) \no hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) \no  verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) \nThe four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) \nThe three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) \nThe camera SD card (NYCO24351) \nI think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed.

We're not able to get web-enabled access through any \nFBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which \nboth we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense \ncounsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that \nthe best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process \n—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to \ndo with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. \nAnd we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents \nearlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. \nAgain, I understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, \nwhich I understand will be segregated and designated by device.

The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not \"processing\" anything. You are taking files \nthat I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a \ntaint review. \nRelativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a \ncomputer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted \nyou do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what \nwas already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So \nnow and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. \nEFTA00032112\n\nSorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital \nevidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have \ngotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it \npiece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were \nprocessed, that you wanted to do it \"all at once\", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a \ndifferentiation of methodology I suppose. \nand I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the \nattribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a  while \nback was lacking. \nFBI NY CART Coordinator \nSenior Examiner \nFrom: \n)  < \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:33 AM \nTo: \n(NY) \n(FBI) <\nM>: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nOkay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run?

Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The \nexcel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on \n2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by \n\"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as \n\"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. \nFor example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see the \nattached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is \nthat a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense \ncounsel. \nEFTA00032117\n\nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the \nnative files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively \nmeans that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \n- Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of \nnumbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual \nlarge file in the native files, it would be impossible. \nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to \nget a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a \nmillion documents without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-\nkeeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the \nSW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful. \nthanks, \nFrom: \n. \n(NY) (FBI) <\n> \nSent: Wednesday, March 04, 2020 16:36 \nTo: \n(NY) \n(FBI) \n<->; (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <\n>; \n(FBI) \n< \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(USANYS) \n(NY) \nHere is a  listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review.

I can say, off the top of my head, that all \nwindows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY \nonly contained pictures, no documents.

We didn't hear back on \nwhich files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the \nmaterials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., \nwhich devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. \nBased on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are \napproximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even \ncounting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, \nincluding multiple servers / server racks. \nSo we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving \npieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from \nTuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time \nto schedule a productive meeting. \nthanks all, \nMi• \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, February 15, 2020 16:30 \nTo: (NY) (FBI) c:•; \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor]\n(NY) (FBI) a> \n'c›; \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nEFTA00032120\n\nss \nI'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it —  I have \nthe hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old \nmaterials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. \nJust generally, and and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what \nwe're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of \nwhich devices have been extracted and downloaded. \nSo for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled \"loadFiles\" through \"37loadFiles\" with a \nmodified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received —  but I'm not sure, because we \nhaven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled \n\"NYC024362\" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? \nThat folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. \nI don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder \nor file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition \nto what we already have. =, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a \nspreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —\nwhich device, and what materials from it —  are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think \norganizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. \nWe're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00032121",
