The only thing I wanted to highlight to you is that \nbased on this spreadsheet, it seems to say that only five devices from NY have materials that are still outstanding to be \ntransferred to us (looking at the \"Remaining to be transferred\" column). Just based on what we've gotten so far, I find \nthat difficult to understand (since we have so few overall dots), but even assuming that's right, *anything* in the prior \ntwo transfers to us (one hard drive that we did upload, that was all screwed up for the reasons you previously identified, \nand one hard drive that we didn't upload for the same reasons) needs to be re-transferred based on the format you and \nhave discussed, right? \nI just want to make sure he doesn't only transfer what he views as \"remaining,\" leaving us with like 95% of the material \nbeing in a form that's not useful for us. And figured I'd check with you to see if that's your understanding with him before \nreplying all to clarify. \nthank you! \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, May 14, 2020 15:54 \nTo: \nCc: \nEFTA00016437\n\nSubject: Re: Epstein search warrant documents \nHere is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the \nunique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to \nconvey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate \nsize, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load \nfile group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry \nin that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an \niPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up.

We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI \ntool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both \nwe and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. \nI've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from is that the best \nway to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which \nI just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the \ntaint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. \nAnd we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier \nthis year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I \nunderstand from that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I \nunderstand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the \napproach, as well as the timeline. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 13:03 \nTo: \nEFTA00016438\n\nCc: \n>; \n>; >; \nSubject: Re: Epstein search warrant documents \nJust to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not \"processing\" anything. You are taking files \nthat I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a \ntaint review. \nRelativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a \ncomputer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted \nyou do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was \nalready done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now \nand I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. \nSorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital \nevidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have \ngotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece \nby piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that \nyou wanted to do it \"all at once\", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of \nmethodology I suppose. \nand I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the \nattribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a  while \nback was lacking. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:33 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nC \nOkay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically \nsending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but \nregardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that \nmeans that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing \nourselves, correct?

Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The \nexcel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on \nEFTA00016443\n\n2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by \n\"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as \n\"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. \nFor example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see the \nattached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is \nthat a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense \ncounsel. \nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the \nnative files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively \nmeans that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \nRelated, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers \nand no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the \nnative files, it would be impossible. \nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get \na similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million \ndocuments without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-\nkeeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful.
