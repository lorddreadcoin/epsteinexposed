PURPOSE \nAND OVERVIEW \nThe Epstein Victims' \nCompensation Program (the \n\"Program\") is a \nvoluntary, independent Program \nthat \nhas been \nestablished to \ncompensate and resolve the \nclaims of victims-survivors \nof sexual abuse by \nJeffrey Epstein (\"Epstein\"). \nThe Estate of Jeffrey \nEpstein (the \"Estate\") has \nretained the services of \nnationally recognized claims \nadministration experts \nKenneth R. Feinberg, Camille \nS. Biros and Jordana H. \nFeldman to design the \nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also \nserve as the Administrator of \nthe Program (the \n\"Administrator\"). This \nProtocol reflects input \nfrom victims-survivors, \ntheir lawyers, other \npotentially interested \nparties, and \nrepresentatives of the \nEstate. \nThrough the Program, the Estate \nwishes to acknowledge the \nwrongs endured by victims\n-survivors and \noffer them an \nopportunity to voluntarily resolve \ntheir individual claims for such \nsexual abuse. \nThe Program is \ngoverned by the following \nnon-exclusive guiding \nprinciples: \n• The Program is \npurely voluntary. It does \nnot affect any rights a  Claimant \nmay have \nunless and until the \nClaimant accepts the offered \ncompensation and \nexecutes a \nRelease. A Claimant \nmay reject the offer of \ncompensation and may \nstop \nparticipating in the \nProgram and withdraw the claim \nat any time prior to \nexecution \nof the \nRelease. \n• The Program \nis  independent and will in no \nway be administered, controlled or \noverseen by the Estate. The \nAdministrator is \nresponsible for all decisions \nrelating to \nthe review, processing \nand evaluation of \nindividual claims \nsubmitted to the \nProgram. The Administrator will \nhave final, binding and \nexclusive authority to \ndetermine \nClaimant eligibility and the \nvaluation of each eligible \nindividual claim. \nDecisions of the \nAdministrator made pursuant to \nthis Protocol are not subject \nto \nreview or modification in any \nway by the Estate or any \nother party or entity. \n• There is no cap \nor limitation on \nthe aggregate \namount of funds available \nto \ncompensate all \neligible Claimants or on the \namount of compensation to \nbe made to \neach individual \nClaimant. Each individual claim \nwill be evaluated \nseparately by the \nAdministrator. \nThe Administrator \nwill determine, in \nher sole and exclusive \ndiscretion, \nissues of eligibility and \nthe amount of \ncompensation and the \nEstate will \npay all \neligible claims based \non the Administrators \ndetermination. \nI \nI  Page \nEFTA00018200\n\n• All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without \nregard to \nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To \nensure claims will be \nadjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process \nso that all Claimants can equally access the \nProgram's claim process. Individuals \nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their \nclaims and to request special process \naccommodations. \nThe \nProgram is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were \nharmed, when they were \nharmed, whether the claim is  time-barred by the applicable \nstatute of limitations, and whether they \nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. \nThe exclusive claims \nperiod for filing a  claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (\"Filing \nDeadline\"). All \nindividual claims \nfiled with the Program must be filed within this \nperiod. \nTo complement \nthe Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the \nconsent \nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. \nHamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert, \nleading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. \nHamilton's role will be to further inform the \nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual \nabuse, common responses to sexual abuse, \nand the impact of \nsexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in \ndeveloping or \nupdating \npolicies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding \nsensitivities involved in \ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a  referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who \nseek guidance, counseling or other services. The \nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with \nthe Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. \nHamilton review an individual claimant file. \nThe Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in \nher discretion, the \nneed to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them \nwith Ms. Hamilton. \nAs \nset forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the \nadministration \nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, \nand determination of individual claims \nsubmitted to the \nProgram. \nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or \nspeak with a  Claimant or her \nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the \nAdministrator present. Ms. Hamilton \nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not \ndisclose outside the Program any information she obtains \nthrough her participation in the Program, \nincluding individual Claimants' submissions. \nWave \nEFTA00018201\n\nII. \nELIGIBILITY \nREQUIREMENTS \nA.

Feldman, Administrator \nClaimants are invited to \nprovide documentation identified in the \nClaim Form, and any other \ncorroborating or supporting information \nsufficient to substantiate \nthe claim, satisfy eligibility \nrequirements, and allow \nthe Administrator to review, \nprocess and evaluate the \nclaim. If the claim is \nbeing presented by a  Legal \nRepresentative, then the Legal Representative will \nbe responsible for \nsubmitting the \nnecessary documentation relating to \nthe represented Claimant. \nAdditional \ndocumentation may be \nrequested at the discretion of the \nAdministrator. Both the \nClaimant \nand the Estate \nwill be afforded the opportunity \nto submit to the Administrator any \ninformation deemed \nrelevant to the \nAdministrator's evaluation and determination of the \nclaim before the Administrator's \nfinal \ndisposition of the claim. \nIf  a  Claimant submits an \nincomplete or deficient claim, \nthe Administrator will notify the \nClaimant, \nexplain the \nadditional information that is needed, and \nwork with the Claimant or the Claimant's \nLegal \nRepresentative (where applicable) to \nassist in submitting a \ncomplete claim. \nB.

The Administrator \nmay also request a  meeting \nwith a  Claimant or her Legal \nRepresentative at a  reasonable mutually convenient \ntime and location, \nthough the \nClaimant is not obligated to attend any such \nmeeting. \n3. Release \nBy submitting a \nclaim to the Program, a  Claimant is seeking to resolve all \nclaims relating to allegations \nof \nsexual abuse against Epstein and/or the \nEstate, and related entities and individuals as set \nforth in the \nRelease. \nIf a  Claimant chooses to accept the offer \nof compensation pursuant to the Program, \nthe \nClaimant will be \nrequired to sign and execute a  full Release, in a  form \nsatisfactory to the Estate, of all \npast and future claims (including \nIfs pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such \nallegations of \nsexual \nabuse against the Estate, related entities \nand/or related individuals. A Claimant \nmay reject the \noffer \nof compensation and may stop \nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the \nclaim at any time \nprior to the \nexecution of the Release. \nThe \nRelease will waive any rights the \nClaimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or \nbeneficiaries \nmay have to assert \nany claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse \nagainst the Estate, related \nentities and/or related individuals, to file an \nindividual legal action relating to such allegations, or to \nparticipate in any civil legal action associated \nwith such allegations, except as a \nwitness. However, \nthe \nRelease will not operate to \npreclude or limit the Claimant's ability \nto report and discuss \nallegations of sexual abuse with law \nenforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the \nRelease will \nnot impose any rules of confidentiality on \nclaimants, who are expressly \npermitted to \ndiscuss \ntheir allegations without \nrestriction, should they choose. \nBefore signing a Release, the \nClaimant must consult with an attorney \nselected by the Claimant. If the \nClaimant is not \nrepresented by an attorney, the Program will \nprovide an attorney to provide free legal \ncounseling to the Claimant \nfor the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the \nlanguage and \nbinding nature of the \nRelease. \nNo one affiliated with the Program \nwill provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under \nthe \nProgram. Claimants are urged to \nconsult with a  tax advisor concerning any \nquestions regarding \ntax \nliability for payments \npursuant to the Program. \n4. Payments \nUpon the Claimant's acceptance \nof the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's \nreceipt of \nthe Claimant's executed Release and, \nwhere applicable, dismissal with \nprejudice of any existing \nlawsuit, legal actions \nor claims against the Estate or related \nentities and/or related individuals, the \nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic \nfunds transfer to each eligible Claimant as \ndirected by the Claimant. \nChecks will be sent to Claimants via \novernight courier service. All \n71 Page \nEFTA00018206\n\npayments made \nunder the Program shall be for a  Claimant's physical injuries, physical sickness and \nresulting \nemotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. \nC. \nProgram \nIntegrity \nFor the \npurpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and \nfinancial resources for eligible \nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures \nto prevent payment of fraudulent \nclaims, including taking steps to verify claims \nand analyze submissions for inconsistencies, \nirregularities or \nduplication. \nEach Claimant who signs the Claim Form at \nthe time of submission certifies that the \ninformation \nprovided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to \nthe best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the \nClaimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may \nresult in \nfines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. \nClaims that appear to be \npotentially fraudulent or \nto contain information known by the Claimant to be \nfalse when made will be \nforwarded to \nfederal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the \nDistrict Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for \npossible investigation and prosecution. \nD. \nConfidentiality/Privacy \nThe Program is confidential.1  By filing a claim with the Program, \nthe Claimant or her Legal \nRepresentative (where applicable) agrees that information \nsubmitted by the Claimant pursuant to \nthe Program will be \nused and/or disclosed by the Administrator and \nher designees only for the \nfollowing purposes: \nI) Processing and \nevaluating the Claimant's claim; \n2) \nAdministering the Program and other Program-related work; and \n3) Reports to law \nenforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent \nclaims. \nWhen documents or \nother information maintained or submitted by the \nEstate become part of a \nClaimant's file for \npurposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to \nassist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain \nconfidential. No information \nprovided by \nClaimants will be provided to the Estate except \nfor the Claimant's name and the date(s) \nand location(s) \nof the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of \nprocessing and evaluating the claim and, \nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or \nby whom the Claimant \nalleges she was trafficked or sexually \nabused. The Estate has agreed that no information \nobtained \nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or \nused by the Estate in defending itself from any \nclaim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not \navailable for inspection, review or copying by \nthe Estate or the Claimant \nor her representatives during or after the Program, and \nall pertinent \nAll parties agree that they are using the services of a \nthird•party \nadministrator to help reach a resolution \nof Individual claims \nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is \nentitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent \nprivileges), \nand protection from disclosure under \napplicable law. \n8IPage \nEFTA00018207\n\nmediation \nprivileges, \nsettlement \nprivileges \nand \nother \nprivileges \napply. \nTo \nprotect \nthe \nprivacy \nof \nClaimants \nparticipating \nin \nthe \nProgram, \nall \npersonal \ninformation \nprovided \nby \nthe \nClaimant \nduring \nthis \nprocess \nwill \nbe \nreturned \nor \ndestroyed \nwithin \none \nyear \nafter \nthe \nconclusion \nof \nthe \nProgram. \nIndividual \nClaimants \nare \nnot \nbound \nthrough \nthe \nProgram \nby \nany \nrules \nof \nconfidentiality. \nClaimants \nmay, \nat \ntheir \nsole \nand \nvoluntary \noption, \ndisclose \ninformation \nin \ntheir \npossession \nregarding \ntheir \nclaim, \ntheir \ncompensation \nand \ntheir \nexperience \nwith \nthe \nProgram. \nAll \nconfidentiality \nrequirements \nare \nsubject \nto \nlaw, \nregulation \nand \njudicial \nprocess. \nE. \nReporting \nThe \nAdministrator \nshall, \non \na  \nmonthly \nbasis, \nconfidentially \nprovide \nreports \nregarding \nthe \nnumber \nand \ntotal \nvalue \nof \nclaims \npaid \neach \nmonth \nto \nthe \nProbate \nCourt \nof \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nVirgin \nIslands \nand \nthe \nAttorney \nGeneral \nof \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nVirgin \nIslands. \nSuch \nreports \nwill \nreport \non \nan \naggregate \nlevel \nonly. \nNo \nindividual \nClaimant \ninformation \nwill \nbe \npublished \nor \ndisclosed \nin \na  \nway \nthat \ncompromises \nClaimant \nconfidentiality. \n91Pap,c, \nEFTA00018208",
