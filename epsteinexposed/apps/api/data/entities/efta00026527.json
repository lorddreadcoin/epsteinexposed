Presumably remotely. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 2, 2020 8:52 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: Arrest Today \nthank you for the heads up. Hope all is well. \nSent from my BlacicBerry - the most \nsecure mobile device \nFrom: \nSent \nJuly 2, 2020 8:50 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Arrest Today \nEd, \nJust a heads up that we are unsealing an indictment this morning against Ghislane Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey \nEpstein, charging her with facilitating his abuse of minors. She was arrested in New Hampshire this morning, so the \npresentment will not be in SDNY.  She will not appear in SDNY today. Let me know if you have any issues. \nChief, Criminal Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office, SDNY \nEFTA00026527",
