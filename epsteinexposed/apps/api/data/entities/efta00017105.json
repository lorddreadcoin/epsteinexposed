Some individuals will be subject to grand \njury subpoenas, and others may be meeting with us in lieu of testifying before the grand jury. We can advise if we believe \nwe need to use USAO funds, or if other issues arise, but we can confirm we do still have an active grand jury investigation \n(including prospective grand jury testimony). \nthanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 17:38 \nTo: \nSubject: FW: CONFIDENTIAL: Coordinating Victim Interviews Against Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nWhat case am I using to bring witnesses into SDNY. I can only bring people in for GJ, pretrial, trial and sometimes pre GJ. \nFor the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment. \nIf you are interviewing more people in an investigation you are going to have to travel to them. \nI am not giving anyone a hard time I just need to follow the rules. \nPlease let me know. \nFrom: Colleen Mullen\nSent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:20 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nTeri Gibbs ; Arick Fudali\nSubject: CONFIDENTIAL: Coordinating Victim Interviews Against Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear \nI spoke yesterday and she confirmed that she is still interested in speaking with our clients. \nis still available to meet with prosecutors on August 26, 2019 at 12:00 .m. in New York. \nPlease let me know what information you need from me to arrange flights/hotel stay for \nAdditionally, you previously mentioned that there may be counseling resources available for our clients.
