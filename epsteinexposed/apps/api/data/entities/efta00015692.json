    "text": "\n\nFrom: 'Pc' \nTo: \nSubject: Celebrate Epstein team \nDate: Sun, 28 Jun 2020 13:58:39 +0000 \nI thought we should set aside time after the team gets the indictment—the way we gather a team into \npat on the back after a victory. \nA virtual pat on the back. Via WEBEX \nI want to say: \noffice for a \nCongratulations. Great job, \nThis was a challenging case to make — to say the least. \nThe facts were old and there was that pesky thing called a statute of limitations. \nYou worked your way through that to a solution that should win the day, \nYou had the challenge of working with victim witnesses whose cooperation and trust you needed to secure. \nYou did that with empathy and genuine caring about them and at the same time a dedication to bringing the case against \nMaxwell that is indisputably a worthy case that should have been brought. \nYour legal work was excellent as evidenced by your brilliant pros memos and well drafted indictment. \nSo I thank you and commend each of you individually and as a team. \nIf I could pass around a celebratory drink I would but instead I will simply ask you to raise a glass tonight with your \nsignificant other and know that I am also raising one at home for you at the same time. \nCOMMENTS? \nEFTA00015692",
