I realize records from 12 or 13 years ago may be difficult to track \ndown. I appreciate you checking into to this. \nI have two other quick questions, if you wouldn't mind. \nIs your conference always held the same time of year? I see this year it's in late October. Also, what hotels did the \nconference use in 2001? \nThank you again and have a good weekend, \nSA \nFBI Miami Division \n505 Flagler Dr. Ste. 500 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \n(561) 833-7517 \n(561) 650.6951 fax \nFrom: Adele Thonn \n[mallto:athonn@jeffersoncompanles.com] \nSent: \nFridi, .15, 2011 11:27 AM \nTo:\n Jo \nSubject: Re: Conference Information \nGood morning, Ms. MM. For the moment I can verify for you which hotel was utilized for the Conferences \nlisted below. Regarding these two individuals participating, however, I'll have to get back with you. We've \ntransitioned through several computer databases since then and all of our paper records were destroyed at our \nstorage facility several years ago. I'll do some checking and get back with you hopefully early next week. \n1998: Event located at Hyatt Regency, New Orleans; also used Windsor Court for sleeping rooms \n1999: Event and sleeping rooms at Hyatt Regency, New Orleans \n2000: Event located at Sheraton New Orleans; also used Windsor Court for sleeping rooms \nOn Apr 14, 2011, at 3:00 PM, \nJo \nwrote: \nGood afternoon, \nAfter calling 1-800-648-8411 for general conference information, the young lady there suggested that I  email you as the \nconference coordinator. \nI  am a special agent with the Miami Division/West Palm Beach Office of the FBI.
