Thanks. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded \nmessage: \nFrom: ' \nTo: ' \n(USANYS \nSubject: and interview notes \nSee attached. \n) (FBI)\" \nRegarding the -interview from yesterday to summarize it went well. He is very cooperative and willing \nto speak again if needed. He recalls in some fashion him and recruiting and or bringing girls to \nEpstein. He recalls that Epstein and only Epstein would pay him $200 for the girls he brought. His interactions \nwith Maxwell were very limited as he remembers. He didn't seem to think they chatted about bringing girls to \nthe house. He does recall recruiting and giving her the pre massage speech about how it all goes \ndown. \nDetective \nNYPD /  FBI \nChild Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force \nOffice: \nCell: \nFax: \nEFTA00026769",
