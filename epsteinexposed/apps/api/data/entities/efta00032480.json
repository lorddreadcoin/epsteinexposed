They also advise to reconsider \ntravel abroad at this time due to the impact of COVID-19. Many areas throughout the world are experiencing outbreaks and are taking \nactions that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions. Even countries without reported cases of COVID-\n19 are taking measures and may restrict travel without notice. Please view the Department of State's Travel Advisory Webpage \nfor the \nmost updated information. \nOfficial Passports \nDue to public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, effective immediately, the Department of States Special Issuance \nAgency (SIA) are only offering service to issue passports for customers with a qualified life-or-death emergency with a need to be issued \na passport for international travel within 72 hours. SIA defines life-or-death as a serious illness, injury, or death in one's immediate family \n(e.g., parent, sibling, aunt uncle, dependent, etc.). This means official passports will not be processed during this time until further \nnotice. If an employee without an official passport needs to complete essential international travel, and they have a valid tourist \npassport, they must obtain approval from the host country via email to travel in their official capacity on a tourist \npassport, and submit that approval with all of the usually required foreign travel documentation and approvals to \nFly \nAmerica Act \nPlease \nemail \nthe mailbox if you have a safety related need to request an exception to the Fly America Act \nIf you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this matter, please contact the RMP Travel Staff \nat \nOriginal Message-----\nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 3:03 PM \nTo: \n) 4c>\nCc: \nSubject: Travel \nEFTA00032480\n\nShould we go ahead and book our travel at this point?
