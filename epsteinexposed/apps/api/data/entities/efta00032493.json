Is it permissible for me to just book the \nsecond leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 a.m. flight but \nthat way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any inconvenience but wanted \nto check —  thank you! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 16:01 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nThanks \n•- \nhave a great weekend. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 15:55 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nAll approved. \nSent from my iPad \nOn May 24, 2019, at 2:57 PM, \nS \n> \nwrote: \nAgain in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately \nthree days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly \ndown Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). \nUnfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either \nbe me and or and but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it \nsuper last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a \nconference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. \nthanks very much, \nEFTA00032493\n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 20:57 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nThank you \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 20:46 \nTo: \nCc: Ms; \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nApproved \nSent from my iPad \nOn Apr 3, 2019, at 8:02 PM, \nS \n> \nwrote: \nFor the same case as below, United States v.
