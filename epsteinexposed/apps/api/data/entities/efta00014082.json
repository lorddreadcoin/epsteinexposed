I, do hereby declare that I  am a member in good standing of the Bar \nof the State of Florida. I  graduated from the University of California at Berkeley School of Law \n(Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the in \nSacramento, \nCalifornia, I  was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I  also am admitted to practice in all \ncourts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Federal Circuit Courts of \nAppeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida, the District of Minnesota, \nand the Northern District of California. My bar admission status in California and Minnesota is \ncurrently inactive. I  am currently employed as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida and was so employed during all of \nthe events described herein. \n2. I  am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey \nEpstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"). The federal \ninvestigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department (\"PBPD\") \ninto allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate \ncommerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution, \namongst other offenses. PBPD had asked for federal assistance because of concerns regarding the \nmanner in which the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office (\"State \nAttorney's Office\") had \nhandled \nthe case. \n3. Throughout the investigation, when a  victim was identified, victim notification letters \nwere \nprovided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached \nhereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three clients, \nFl \nYour Affiant's letter to was hand-delivered by the FBI agents (Ex. 1). Your Affiant's letter to \nwas hand-delivered by \nmyself to \nat the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2). Both \nandM also received letters from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, which were dispatched on \nJanuary 8, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). was initially identified in the PBPD's investigation. Her status as \nEFTA00014082\n\na victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by federal agents on May 28, \n2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter \nto■ \non May 30, 2008 \n(Ex. 5). \n4. Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, and \nyour Affiant had contact with Attorney Edwards' other client, was \nrepresented \nby counsel and, \naccordingly, all contact with was made through that attorney. That attorney was \nJames \nEisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation. \n5. In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida (\"the Office\") entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. At that time, \nMr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida \nStatutes §  796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys sought a  global resolution of the matter. The United States \nsubsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as \ncertain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a federal \nremedy for the young girls which Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, \nnotice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following: \n\"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in \nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under \nSection 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted \nof an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States \nshall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to \nname in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial \nauthority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which \nevidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the \nparties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had \nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No \nmore; no less.\" \nAn agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an express confidentiality \nprovision. \n6. Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had \nexpressed \nconcerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt \nresolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, \n• \nwas openly \nhostile to the prosecution of Epstein, and■ \nhad refused to \nspeak with federal investigators. None of \nAttorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal \ninvestigation. \n7. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the State of \nFlorida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the agreement was \nEFTA00014083\n\nsigned, four victims were contacted \nby telephone and these provisions were discussed. One of those \nvictims wasM. who, at the time, was not represented, was given notice of the \nagreement. Notice was \nalso \nprovided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that \nsome \nof the victims had been notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to \noverstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your \nAffiant knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent \nevidence \nwell before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I concluded that informing \nadditional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the \nagreement. \n8. In mid-June, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he \nrepresented \nand i. and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I invited Attorney \nEdwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was provided. I also \nadvised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the \nState Attorney's Office, if he so \nwished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to \nso I advised him that, to my knowledge,.. was still represented by Attorney \nJames Eisenberg. \n9. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a \ncopy of the proposed \nstate plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, \n2008. \nYour Affiant, the agents, and the Palm Beach Police Department all attempted to provide notification to \nthe victims, and your Affiant specifically called Attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients \nregarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards \nnotified me that he \nrepresented, \nand I asked him to pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney \nEdwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be \npresent at the \nhearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. \n10. On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to via their \nattorney, Bradley Edwards. A notification was not provided to \nbecause the U.S. \nAttorney's \nmodification limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an \nindictment. In light oarior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith \ninclude ■ \nas a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided \nto \nI \nEpstein's \ncounsel. \nEFTA00014084\n\n11. Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not \never contact \nme prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his Emergency \nPetition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had already received the Certification of \nEmergency and Emergency Petition, I  received a letter from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via \nCertified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and the United States \nAttorney to consider \"vigorous enforcement\" of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains \nno \ndemand for the relief requested in the Emergency Petition. \n12. I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ \n1746 that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect \nto the best of my knowledge and belief. \nExecuted this \nday of \nJuly, 2008. \nA. Marie Villafafia, Esq. \nAttorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of \"Jane Doe,\" without identifying which of his clients is \nthe purported victim. Accordingly, I  will address facts related to All three of those clients \nwere victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old. \nL2The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing or whether ■ ever \nformally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation. \nEFTA00014085",
