Preet Bharara speaks very highly of you. \nCongratulations to you, Geoff Berman, and your outstanding team of dedicated line prosecutors who put this case together, \nas well as to the FBI agents and NYPD detectives who worked it. \nPlease realize that there is a great deal of apprehension amongst the public at large, and extending to some individuals in law enforcement \nand corrections, that the MCC is not a secure facility and that Jeffrey Epstein's death there last summer was a homicide. Knowing, as I do, \nof the manpower, training and management problems which have plagued the BOP and seem to be endemic at the MCC, concerns about \nMs. Maxwell's safety are not unfounded. \nI hope that your Office will seek remand and that Maxwell will be kept isolated in a private cell and monitored 24/7 by multiple cameras \nwith all approaches to her cell covered and no blind spots, and that the feed from same will be monitored by a team of federal Marshalls \nassigned to your Office. \nAs I  told BJ Pak when his Office contacted me a few years ago, I believe that the victims of the Epstein-Maxwell criminal organization or \nconspiracy were badly failed by Alex Acosta. I am happy to see that more competent and independent prosecutors are, at last, close to \nbringing their victims some measure of justice, however belated. \nYours very truly, \nPeter \nPeter Basta Brightbill \nPublished Work Sample \nLinked In \nJMDB \nEFTA00027846",
