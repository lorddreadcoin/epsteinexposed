He also said he'd let her \nknow that would be trying to reach out to her. He provided her current number as: \nif you could please try her this week? Her attorney said she's not great at following up, but we can give it a shot \nand hope for the best. Let me know if any other info would be helpful, and thanks very much. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00027342",
