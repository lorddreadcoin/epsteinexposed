Jeffrey Epstein \nMs. Belohlavek, \nWe represent The Palm Beach Daily News. The newspaper recently discovered that a non-prosecution agreement (and \nan addendum thereto) was filed under seal pursuant to an agreed order entered in the above-referenced case. Because \nthe records are sealed, we cannot assess the propriety of the decision to seal them or even whether the newspaper is \ninterested in the information contained therein. I was hoping you would discuss with me the nature of the agreement and \nthe basis for sealing it so that we can advise our client on whether it should pursue an order unsealing the agreement. \nPlease call me at your earliest convenience. \nVery truly yours, \nC. Bryce Albu \nReeder & Reeder P.A. \n250 S. Central Blvd., Suite 200 \nEFTA00014066",
