I see from the paper that you are in a firestorm of your own \nright now. \nI just spoke with He said that if you provide the address info, it will not be disclosed to Epstein \nor his people. Epstein is accompanied only by his private driver when he goes to and from the jail, although \nPBSO has his travel routes programmed in to his GPS monitor so, if he deviates from that route, they will know \nif they check the monitor when he returns. \nhas asked that all requests go through me so he knows who is legit and who isn't, so if anyone \nwants their addres(es) added, please let me know. I am going to send an e-mail to all of the plaintiffs' attorneys \nwith this info. \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \n500 S.

I  got a notification back that it did not go through, so I'm trying \nthis different address. \nIn your notification letter about JE's work release that you wrote to the victims you mentioned the possibility of their \nnotifying you if they wanted any of their addresses made off limits on his mechanical device that restricts him. First, if  he is \nonly going to and from that office address, why does he need to be mechanically otherwise restricted? Second, should one \nof the victims want to designate an address where she lives or works to be programmed as off limits, is it  possible for him \nto then have access to the name of the victim and the specific location from which he is being restricted? \nWishing you a peaceful and happy holiday!
