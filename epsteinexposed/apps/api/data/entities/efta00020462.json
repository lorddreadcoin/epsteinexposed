I showed my best art to former high school \nclassmates (several were Israeli, 1 was friends with serbians who were \nfriends with the princess of Yugoslavia and the lingerie model actress \nserbian-Canadian and her ex boyfriend the actor Matthew \nSettle who owed money and they set up an elaborate plan involving a \nfalse romance and grooming me to ultimately be approached by ghislaine \nmaxwell and jeffrey epstein several days after all of ny artwork \nUNCLASSIFIED \nEFTA00020462\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY\n-3027571, \n08/03/2020 \ndisappeared while Matthew helped the \nIsraeli moving company Northstar \n/Moishe's move me into my very first \napartment in July 1997 when I was 20 \nyears old in Los Angeles. In retrospect there was a clear plot taking \nplace, and I was introduced to Epstein early on at a bar next to were \nMatthew Settle Lived. \nI \nheard \ncall him on the \nphone and ask on \nspeaker phone sometime between April- June of \n1997 if Matthew had her \nmoney yet. He said to me she would send the \nSerbian mafia to hurt him if \nhe didn't come up with the money. He did not mention that my artwork was \nwhere the money was \ngoing to come from. The friend of mine who told her \nserbian friends about my artwork which started chain of events \nculminating in the \ndisappearance of all of my artwork is named Jasmine \nDashtizad. One of my stolen paintings is of Bill Clinton's head on a \nwoman (Hillary Clinton's) \nbody. \nI \npainted it between November 1995 to \nJanuary 1996. I was a teenager. \nI \ndrew my own dental \nimpressions in the \nRay Johnson estate collage, I also drew \none of my fingerprints. And \nthat art is made out of pieces of my high \nschool calendar which fell \napart from overuse, so \nI \nglued the pieces onto thick cardstock and drew \ndesigns and draeings around the glued pieces. I also traced my own \nhandprints on that art. I also drew a replica of the art on the cover of \nmy 12th grade high school \nplay production program and I also wrote the \nfictional \nbio of Ray Johnson. \nViolation: \nPublic Corruption, White Collar Crime, Civil Rights \nViolation \nQuestions \nWhat was the exact crime that occurred?: Art theft / Art Fraud / Art \nForgery \nDoes this information involve a government official? If so, what is their \nname and position/title?: no \nDo you have any evidence to support your claim or know of any witnesses \nto the crime(s)?: Yes and some evidence and witnesses who saw the art \nbefore it disappeared \nUNCLASSIFIED \nEFTA00020463\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY\n-3027571, \n08/03/2020 \nDid you suffer any personal losses (financially or physically) due to the \ncrime?: yes to both questions I've spent $100,000 my Dad had to give me \nto buy my stolen artwork back, but most of it I can't get back because \nit's been sold through Sotheby's in June 22, 2017 London catalogue \nartwork misattributed to a variety of artists, also the D.B. Henkel \npaintings are my stolen forged paintings, some of the Paul Tobeler stolen \npaintings are \nmine, the Adler-Beatty Ray Johnson estate \nHow long has \nthis activity been going on?: Since 1997 when it disappeared \nin Los Angeles, some of it \nis also in the Adelson gallery, some of it has \nbeen sold to Tony Podesta by a fake artist, 3 paintings are part of \nJeffrey Epstein's estate, 1 of those falsely claimed by Petrina \nRyan \nKleid who used my 3 of my paintings as her college portfolio art \nComplainant Information \nFirst \nName: \nMiddle \nName: \nLast Name: \nAge: \nDOB: \nAdditional Info: \nType: Cell \nPhone: \nExtension: \nAccount: \nType: Residential \nUNCLASSIFIED \n3 \nEFTA00020464\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY\n-3027571, \n08/03/2020 \nAddress: \nCity: North Hollywood \nState: \nCalifornia \nZip: 91601 \nCountry: United States \nSubject \nInformation \nFirst \nName: Jeffrey Matthew \nMiddle \nName: \nLast Name: Settle \nAge: \n50 \nDOB: \nAdditional Info: Ray johnson estate - online website - the artwork is \nlisted in the \nSmithsonian museum's online art and is falsely attributed \nto a deceased person in the art gallery world \nnamed David Bourdain or \nBourdan for the year 1998. It was stolen from \nme in July 1997. \nPetrina Ryan Kleid has an \nonline presence and has many fake articles \nwritten about my artwork falsely attributed to herself. \nOne of \nthose paintinhs was originally a painting of Dan Quayle, but \nsomeone has painted over the face to make it look like George Bush Jr. \nInstead. That painting used to depict a note tacked on to the wall that \nspelled potato wrong (potatoe) which was crossed out and underneath was \nwritten the correct spelling of potatoes. Also, my signature used to be \nUNCLASSIFIED \nEFTA00020465\n\nUNCLASSIFIED \nRe: 50D-NY-3027571, 08/03/2020 \non the front of the desk but it has been painted over. I usually used \npermanent marking pen ink for my signature, so it probably can be \ndetected using the appropriate technologies for analyzing art. This \napplies to all of my stolen paintings. But my drawings were often signed \nin pencil but I drew my fingerprint, my dental impressions and my traced \nhandprints on the Ray Johnson estate art that is listed in the \nSmithsonian. There is a lot more information about fraud and forgery \ngoing on with Sotheby's London 2017 and db henkel in traverse city. It \nwould like to share all information in depth, so that all of these fake \n/forged worthless paintings that were stolen from me can be removed \npermanently from the big money art market and hopefully returned to me \nbecause they belong to me, they are sentimental personal property and I \nwill never get over this until these people are stopped from their art \nfraud. Another gake artist has a serbian name Biljana Djurdjevic and \nTony Podesta bought all of those stolen paintings of mine, including one \nthat is a self portrait of myself at 19 years old. \nHow is Contact Known: this is the person who owed the Serbian- Canadian \nmodel money who was connected to Mark Epstein, Jeffrey \nEpstein, Jean Luc Brunel, Ghislaine Maxwell, Elle McPherson and her \nmanager Stuart, the professional magician J.B.
