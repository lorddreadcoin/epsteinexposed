As set forth herein, over the course of many \nyears, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and \nabused \ndozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, \nNew \nYork, and Palm Beach, Florida, among \nother locations. \n2. In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up \nto and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed \nand recruited, and caused to be enticed and \nrecruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New \nYork (the \"New York Residence\") and his estate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida \n(the \"Palm Beach Residence\") to engage in sex acts with \nhim, after \nwhich he would give the victims hundreds of dollars \nin cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his \nsupply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to \nrecruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In \nEFTA00028990\n\nthis way, EPSTEIN created a vast network \nof underage victims for \nhim to sexually exploit in locations including New York and \nPalm \nBeach. \n3. \nThe victims described herein were as young as 14 \nyears old at the time they \nwere abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, and were, for various reasons, often \nparticularly \nvulnerable to \nexploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out \nminors and knew \nthat many of his victims were in fact under the \nage of 18, including because, in some \ninstances, minor victims \nexpressly \ntold him their age. \n4. In creating and \nmaintaining this network of minor \nvictims in \nmultiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired \nwith \nothers, including \nemployees and associates who facilitated his \nconduct by, among other things, contacting victims and \nscheduling their sexual \nencounters with EPSTEIN at the New York \nResidence and at the Palm Beach Residence. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. During \nall time periods charged in this \nIndictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a \nfinancier with \nmultiple residences in the continental United States, including \nthe New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. \n6. Beginning in at least \n2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and \n2 \nEFTA00028991\n\nrecruited, \ndozens \nof \nminor \ngirls \nto \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nhim, \nafter \nwhich \nEPSTEIN \npaid \nthe \nvictims \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash, \nat \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nand \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence. \n7. \nIn \nboth \nNew \nYork \nand \nFlorida, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nperpetuated \nthis \nabuse \nin \nsimilar \nways. \nVictims \nwere \ninitially \nrecruited \nto \nprovide \n\"massages\" \nto \nEPSTEIN, \nwhich \nwould \nbe \nperformed \nnude \nor \npartially \nnude, \nwould \nbecome \nincreasingly \nsexual \nin \nnature, \nand \nwould \ntypically \ninclude \none \nor \nmore \nsex \nacts. \nEPSTEIN \npaid \nhis \nvictims \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash \nfor \neach \nencounter. \nMoreover, \nEPSTEIN \nactively \nencouraged \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nto \nbe \nsimilarly \nsexually \nabused. \nEPSTEIN \nincentivized \nhis \nvictims \nto \nbecome \nrecruiters \nby \npaying \nthese \nvictim\n-recruiters \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nfor \neach \ngirl \nthat \nthey \nbrought \nto \nEPSTEIN. \nIn \nso \ndoing, \nEPSTEIN \nmaintained \na \nsteady \nsupply \nof \nnew \nvictims \nto \nexploit. \nThe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \n8. \nAt \nall \ntimes \nrelevant \nto \nthis \nIndictment, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \npossessed \nand \ncontrolled \na \nmulti\n-story \nprivate \nresidence \non \nthe \nUpper \nEast \nSide \nof \nManhattan, \nNew \nYork, \ni.e., \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence. \nBetween \nat \nleast \nin \nor \nabout \n2002 \nand \nin \nor \nabout \n2005, \nEPSTEIN \nabused \nnumerous \nminor \nvictims \nat \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nby \ncausing \nthese \nvictims \nto \nbe \nrecruited \nto \nengage \nin \npaid \nsex \nacts \nwith \nhim. \n3 \nEFTA00028992\n\n9. When a \nvictim arrived at the New York Residence, \nshe typically would be escorted to a room with a \nmassage table, \nwhere she would perform a \nmassage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant. The victims, who were as \nyoung as 14 years of age, \nwere told by \nEPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully \nundress before beginning the \n\"massage.\" During the encounter, \nEPSTEIN \nwould escalate the nature and scope of \nphysical contact \nwith his \nvictim to include, among other things, sex acts such as \ngroping and direct and \nindirect contact with the victim's \ngenitals. EPSTEIN typically would also \nmasturbate during these \nsexualized \nencounters, ask victims to touch him while he \nmasturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his \nhands or with \nsex toys. \n10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of \nhis employees or associates, \npaid \nthe victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds \nof dollars in cash for each \nencounter. \n11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nthe defendant, knew that many of \nhis New York \nvictims were underage, including because \ncertain \nvictims told him their age. \nFurther, once these minor victims \nwere recruited, many \nwere abused by EPSTEIN on multiple \nsubsequent occasions at the New York Residence. \nEPSTEIN \nsometimes \npersonally contacted victims to schedule appointments \nat the New York Residence. In \nother instances, EPSTEIN directed \n4 \nEFTA00028993\n\nemployees \nand \nassociates, \nincluding \na \nNew \nYork\n-based \nemployee \n(\"Employee\n-1\"), \nto \ncommunicate \nwith \nvictims \nvia \nphone \nto \narrange \nfor \nthese \nvictims \nto \nreturn \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nfor \nadditional \nsexual \nencounters \nwith \nEPSTEIN. \n12. \nAdditionally, \nand \nto \nfurther \nfacilitate \nhis \nability \nto \nabuse \nminor \ngirls \nin \nNew \nYork, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nasked \nand \nenticed \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nto \nperform \n\"massages\" \nand \nsimilarly \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nEPSTEIN. \nWhen \na \nvictim \nwould \nrecruit \nanother \ngirl \nfor \nEPSTEIN, \nhe \npaid \nboth \nthe \nvictim\n-recruiter \nand \nthe \nnew \nvictim \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash. \nThrough \nthese \nvictim\n-\nrecruiters, \nEPSTEIN \ngained \naccess \nto \nand \nwas \nable \nto \nabuse \ndozens \nof \nadditional \nminor \ngirls. \n13. \nIn \nparticular, \ncertain \nrecruiters \nbrought \ndozens \nof \nadditional \nminor \ngirls \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nto \ngive \nmassages \nto \nand \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant. \nEPSTEIN \nencouraged \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nby \noffering \nto \npay \nthese \nvictim\n-recruiters \nfor \nevery \nadditional \ngirl \nthey \nbrought \nto \nEPSTEIN. \nWhen \na \nvictim\n-\nrecruiter \naccompanied \na \nnew \nminor \nvictim \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence, \nboth \nthe \nvictim\n-recruiter \nand \nthe \nnew \nminor \nvictim \nwere \npaid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nby \nEPSTEIN \nfor \neach \nencounter. \nIn \naddition, \ncertain \nvictim\n-recruiters \nroutinely \nscheduled \nthese \n5 \nEFTA00028994\n\nencounters through Employee-1, \nwho sometimes asked the \nrecruiters \nto bring a specific minor girl for \nEPSTEIN. \nThe Palm Beach Residence \n14. In addition to recruiting and \nabusing minor girls \nin New York, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar \nnetwork of minor girls to \nvictimize in Palm Beach, Florida, \nwhere EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large \nresidence, \ni.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently \ntraveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before \nwhich an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims \nwere available \nfor encounters upon his arrival in Florida. \n15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. \nWhen a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she \nwould be \nescorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of \nEPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants (\"Employee-2\" and \n\"Employee-3\") who, as \ndescribed herein, were also responsible \nfor scheduling sexual \nencounters with minor victims. Once \ninside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage \nfor \nEPSTEIN, who \nwould himself typically be naked. During these \nencounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the \nphysical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct \nand indirect contact with the victim's genitals. \nEPSTEIN would \nalso \ntypically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims \n6 \nEFTA00028995\n\nto \ntouch \nhim \nwhile \nhe \nmasturbated, \nand \ntouch \nvictims' \ngenitals \nwith \nhis \nhands \nor \nwith \nsex \ntoys. \n16. \nIn \nconnection \nwith \neach \nsexual \nencounter, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nor \none \nof \nhis \nemployees \nor \nassociates, \n• \npaid \nthe \nvictim \nin \ncash. \nVictims \ntypically \nwere \npaid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nfor \neach \nencounter. \n17. \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nknew \nthat \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nwere \nunderage, \nincluding \nbecause \ncertain \nvictims \ntold \nhim \ntheir \nage. \nIn \naddition, \nas \nwith \nNew \nYork\n-based \nvictims, \nmany \nFlorida \nvictims, \nonce \nrecruited, \nwere \nabused \nby \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \non \nmultiple \nadditional \noccasions. \n18. \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nwho \nduring \nthe \nrelevant \ntime \nperiod \nwas \nfrequently \nin \nNew \nYork, \nwould \narrange \nfor \nEmployee\n-2 \nor \nother \nemployees \nto \ncontact \nvictims \nby \nphone \nin \nadvance \nof \nEPSTEIN's \ntravel \nto \nFlorida \nto \nensure \nappointments \nwere \nscheduled \nfor \nwhen \nhe \narrived. \nIn \nparticular, \nin \ncertain \ninstances, \nEmployee\n-2 \nplaced \nphone \ncalls \nto \nminor \nvictims \nin \nFlorida \nto \nschedule \nencounters \nat \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence. \nAt \nthe \ntime \nof \ncertain \nof \nthose \nphone \ncalls, \nEPSTEIN \nand \nEmployee\n-2 \nwere \nin \nNew \nYork, \nNew \nYork. \nAdditionally, \ncertain \nof \nthe \nindividuals \nvictimized \nat \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence \nwere \ncontacted \nby \nphone \nby \nEmployee\n-3 \nto \nschedule \nthese \nencounters. \n7 \nEFTA00028996\n\n19. Moreover, as \nin New York, to ensure a steady \nstream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, asked \nand enticed \ncertain victims in Florida to recruit other girls \nto \nengage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid \nhundreds of dollars to victim-\nrecruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm \nBeach Residence. \nSTATUTORY ALLEGATIONS \n20.
