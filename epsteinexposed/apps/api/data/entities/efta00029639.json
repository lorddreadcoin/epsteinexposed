Ms. was abused by \nJeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New \nYork and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They \nboth have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim \nas a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she \nbelieves she may have a claim. \nShe does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to \nretain and attorney soon. \nRegards, \nEFTA00029639",
