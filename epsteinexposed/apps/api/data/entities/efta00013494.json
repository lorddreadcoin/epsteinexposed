I have been wondering the same thing. Here is the term sheet and guidelines calculation \nthat we provided at the last meeting. You and MI and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an Information \ncharging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think must have asked Alex about it and it \nwas nixed. Just to be prepared for tomorrow, I  was just starting to draft a Rule 11 plea agreement in case Alex changes his \nmind and a formal non-prosecution agreement containing the state plea terms. As soon as those are ready, I  will e-mail \nthem to you. \nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow. First, that there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting \nor rejecting because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of September, which means presenting the \nindictment on September 25th.  Second, the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as \npolitely reminded me, is required under the law. And third, I  do not want to make any promises about allowing \nEpstein to self-surrender because I  still believe that we have a good chance of getting him detained. \nOn another note, Junior got a call today from the Palm Beach Police Chief because he got information that there will be an \narticle released tomorrow about our meeting and that Epstein is going to plead to a state charge and the Chief wanted to \nknow if the victims had been consulted about the deal. There has been some coverage in the New York press about Ken \nStarr, but I haven't seen anything local yet. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nFrom: (USAFLS) \nSent: Thursday, September 06, 2007 5:35 PM \nTo: . (USAFLS) \nSubject: Epstein \nPlease refresh my recollection. What is the \"deal\" on the table? \nEFTA00013494",
