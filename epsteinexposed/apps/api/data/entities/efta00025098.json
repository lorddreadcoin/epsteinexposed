I believe they should all be interview 302s, but let us know if there are \nother random reports as well. We got three emails with 302s attached, this is the first and I'll also send the other two —\ncould you please save each of the files into the correct witness folder, keeping the same naming convention, and update \nthe Interview Tracker spreadsheet as you go? \nAnd then let us know when that's complete, and I'll look through and we can figure out what remains outstanding. Please \nlet us know if any questions at all, either up front or as you go through, and thanks as always. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 22, 2020 21:28 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: 302s (1 of 3) \nHey all, \n>; \nAttached are the 302s that have been serialized since the last batch. It's too large to come in one email, so I'm \nsending in 3 for a  total of 24 302s right now. \nEFTA00025098",
