    "text": "\n\nFrom: ' (USANYS)\"  \nTo: ' )\"  \nSubject: NY Judge Rips 'Terrible' Conditions At NYC Federal Jails - Law360 \nDate: Wed, 06 May 2020 11:46:16 +0000 \nNY Judge Rips 'Terrible' Conditions At NYC Federal Jails \nBy Stewart Bishop \nShare us on: \nLaw360, New York (May 5, 2020, 9:12 PM \nEDT) -- A New York federal judge on Tuesday \nderided the \"unfortunate, terrible\" conditions \nat New York City's two main federal jails, both \nbefore and after the coronavirus pandemic, \nduring a hearing where he sentenced an \nadmitted fraudster who tried to steal $2.5 \nmillion from a law firm to time served. \nU.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman \ncriticized the \"deficient system\" at the \nMetropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn \nand said he \"has serious doubts\" about the \nability of the Metropolitan Correctional Center \nin Manhattan to safely and properly house its \ndetainees. \nJudge Berman, who presided over the \ncriminal sex trafficking case against Jeffrey \nEpstein until his suicide at the MCC in \nAugust, said he was very disappointed that to \nhis knowledge, U.S. Attorney General William \nBarr has not conducted a thorough \nassessment and investigation of the Bureau \nof Prisons nationwide, something he said \nBarr pledged to do around the time of \nEpstein's suicide. \nhttps://www.law360.corn/articles/1270636/ny-judge-\nrips-terrible-conditions-at-nyc-federal-jails \nEFTA00025383\n\nIn particular, Judge Berman said as far as he \nknows, there have been no serious reviews \nforthcoming of the poor living conditions at \neither the MCC or the MDC — which he said \nare dirty and infested with drugs and violence \n— conditions that have been many times \ncompounded by the coronavirus outbreak. \n\"It is an outrage I have to say, and I'm very \ndisappointed the Attorney General has not \nfollowed through on making a thorough \ninvestigation of conditions that those of us in \nthe business, as it were, are all too familiar \nwith,\" Judge Berman said. \"And more \nimportantly has not implemented appropriate \nchanges.\" \nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of \nJustice in Washington, D.C., did not \nimmediately respond to a request for \ncomment. \nThe judge's remarks came at the sentencing \nvia video and audio conference of Terrance \nMorgan, who pled guilty to bank fraud \nconspiracy in October for his role in a scheme \nto steal $2.5 million from an unnamed law \nfirm's bank account. \nMorgan, a citizen of Liberia and U.S. resident, \nalready served about 14 months in custody \nwith the Bureau of Prisons — including at the \nMDC — Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and local authorities. \nAn attorney for Morgan, Sam Schmidt, said \nhe was pleased with Judge Berman's \nEFTA00025384\n\ndecision. \n\"It is gratifying to hear that Judge Berman \nfully understands what our clients are going \nthrough in the Bureau of Prisons at this time, \nespecially in MCC and MDC,\" Schmidt said. \nWhile Judge Berman didn't explicitly tie \nMorgan's sentence of time served, three \nmonths of home confinement and four years \nof supervised release to the conditions at the \nMDC, and the dangers of the coronavirus to \ninmates, it appeared to be a major factor. The \njudge also said while he doesn't disagree that \nMorgan's crime was a serious one, he said \nthe goals of general and specific deterrence \nhave been met, and the term of incarceration \nhe has already served is adequate. \nThe judge also appeared to give some \namount of weight to an April 30 report by \nHomer Venters, a physician and \nepidemiologist, who toured the 1,700-inmate \nfacility recently to observe the jail's response \nto COVID-19. \nIn the report, which was filed in a proposed \nclass action brought by medically vulnerable \ninmates seeking release from the prison \nbecause of the coronavirus, Venters \nexcoriated the medical care at MDC in his \nexpert report. \nVenters, who previously served as the chief \nmedical officer for New York City's jails, cited \nan array of problems including faulty virus \nscreening, ignored and discarded sick-call \nrequests, inept medical care and a \"gross \nEFTA00025385\n\ndeviation\" from Centers for Disease \nControland Prevention and correctional \nhealth care standards. \n\"I have to say it's a very serious document. It \nis not surprising to me. I've personally \nbecome acutely aware of the deficiencies at \nthe ... MDC,\" Judge Berman said, citing a \nwell-known incident in January 2019 when a \nfire took out the jail's power and heat. \nInmates were left in frigid conditions for a \nweek and denied meetings with their \nattorneys or any other visits. \nThat incident led to an ongoing lawsuit by the \nFederal Defenders of New York against the \nBOP over attorneys' access to clients in the \nMDC. That case is currently in mediation, \nwhich includes the MCC as well. \nJudge Berman said Venters' report requires \nthat there be a response from the BOP to the \ncriticisms in the document. \n\"Such a response is long overdue,\" Judge \nBerman said. \"It was long overdue when \nJeffrey Epstein committed suicide, long \nbefore then.\" \nThe government is represented by Dina \nMcLeod and Robert B. Sobelman of the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of \nNew York. \nMorgan is represented by Sam A. Schmidt. \nThe case is U.S. v. Morgan et al., case \nnumber 1:19-cr-00209, in the U.S. District \nEFTA00025386\n\nCourt for the Southern District of New York. \n--Additional reporting by Frank G. Runyeon. \nEditing by Amy Rowe. \nEFTA00025387",
