I \nthink she wants to know soon whether we want to do that, because it affects trial arrangements. I'll be on trial on \nWednesday, so defer to you as to whether that fits your schedules. \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Gloria Allred \nDate: October 18, 2019 at 5:02:17 PM EDT \nTo: \" \nCc:' \nEFTA00019706\n\nSubject: Urgent.
