We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell at the number he has \npreviously provided. We will also provide a call on Monday 7/13/20. \nThe EDNY and SDNY created a joint protocol whereby counsel may request legal calls to be placed in the afternoon at the \nMDC. Requests should be sent to \nTruly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, counsel really should \nsend the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to ensure inmates get equitable access. If \nthey anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should make requests in advance and note whether and when calls \nwould be preferred. Generally, calls are for 30 minutes in duration. If a longer call is desired, that should be explained as well. \nIf you need anything else, please let me know. \nThank you, \n» \n„< \nThank you so much, \n> \n7/7/2020 5:00 PM »> \nA 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's something you \nwould be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are very grateful for the time. \nWe have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' counsel \nfollowing the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel thus far. There \nappears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. Would you be able to \nplease share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they understand what steps to take \ngoing forward? \nThank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it. \nBest, \nEFTA00024437\n\nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, July 7, 2020 4:23 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Ghislaine Maxwell (USMS No. 02879-509) \nYou're welcome. \nWould 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), in \nadvance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same \nprotocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. \nI also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to \nfacilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-day, \nthat we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel having \ndifficulty scheduling legal calls. \nThank you, \n> » \" \" < \n> \n7/7/2020 \n2:37 \nPM \n> \n» \nThanks, This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty scheduling legal \ncalls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to address this issue.
