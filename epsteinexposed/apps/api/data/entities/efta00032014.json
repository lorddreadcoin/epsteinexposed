All of the VTC units throughout the \ninstitution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective \nbarrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs \nto investigate concerns you have mentioned. \nFurthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We \noffer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has \ndeclined. \nAdditionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds \nyou are requesting to bring into the institution? \nBest, \nBOBBI C STERNHEIM > 6/16/2021 10:23 AM >» \nGood morning-\nAs reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room \nare negatively impacting attorney-client communication. \nThe video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. \nI am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. \nAlso, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the \nguards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if \nMs. Maxwell is \"off camera\" while leaning against a wall to soothe her \naching \nback; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing \nmachine \nand the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as \nif any of this is funny. \nThe manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives \nme reason to be concerned \nabout how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. \nThe courtesy of a response is \nrequested. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nBOBBI C.
