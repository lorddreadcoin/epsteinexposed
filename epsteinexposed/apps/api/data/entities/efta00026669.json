He told me one of his staff \nmembers would check it out. \nWith respect to the books and legal work, your client's property was packed the same day he went to SHU. The \nproperty was taken to the Lieutenant and then up to SHU. On Wednesday, staff gave your client some legal \npaperwork from his property at his request. However, he told staff there were documents missing that had been \non his bed. Staff relayed that message to me, so that afternoon, I went to your client's cell on 5 North to see \nwhat, if anything, had been left behind. There was nothing on his bed or anywhere near his bed. There were \nabout fifty paperback books piled on his locker and his cellmate's locker. There was also \nsome paperwork laying on the books. I went through the paperwork (not reading it, but scanning it quickly to \ndetermine if the paperwork belonged to your client or his cellmate). Most of the paperwork had case captions \nso it was easily discernible. I found a few papers that belonged to your client, and I gave those to him. Based \non my inspection, I don't believe there was any other paperwork in the cell that belonged to your client. \nShortly after I left, one of the Lieutenants gathered all of the books and put them with the rest of your client's \nproperty. \nWe'll follow up next week to get your client the personal property items to which he is entitled in SHU. \nor I  will keep you updated once we get more information on Monday. \nThank you, \nI didn't have a chance to follow-up about getting \nStaff Attorney \nCLC \nNew York \nEFTA00026669\n\nMetropolitan Correctional Center \n150 Park Row \nNew York, NY 10007\np: \nf: \n>>> \nBruce Barket <1 > 7/5/2019 1:02 PM >» \nGood afternoon, \nAs I think you all know Nick has been placed in SHU based on an allegation that he was in possession of a cell phone. If \ntrue, I understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order. \nLeaving that aside I want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of \nWednesday, he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally \nnothing to read, listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the \naccompanying batteries. \nMost troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been \nreturned to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive work \nproduct that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to prepare \nfor our next meeting. When I saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the documents he was \nworking with when he was taken from the cell. I am very concerned that these documents have been seized by the \nstaff at MCC. Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him immediately. \nLastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward. \nBruce A.
