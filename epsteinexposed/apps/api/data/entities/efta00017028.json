Let's see what it looks like and then we can go from there. I assume we prefer to just get the \nraw data, rather than having the FBI process it poorly again, it's just a really unfortunate delay — so if farming it out would \nultimately be more efficient, especially with everybody working remotely these days, we are very happy to push for that. \nThanks again. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:42 \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nRight now we have a vendor to process the data as that is how we got the data uploaded to Relativity. I do not know the \ndata size of anything yet so I did not want to talk to Ed yet about the amount of data that needs to be processed until I got \nsomething from the FBI. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:37 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: FW: Epstein search warrant documents \n>; \nshould we be asking for permission to retain an outside vendor to deal with this? I just absolutely can't believe that \neight months after the search, the FBI is going to dump terabytes of raw data on us to process, which I assume will take \nsome process of months to process and upload. Would it be more efficient to have someone like Kroll or BRG do this in \nthe first instance? I don't think we would have a problem getting the funding for it, if that would be at all helpful. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 12, 2020 11:33 \nTo: \n) <.>; \nCc: \n>; \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \nOkay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically \nsending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but \nregardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that \nmeans that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing \nourselves, correct?

Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The \nexcel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on \n2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by \n\"loose media\" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as \n\"Windows machines,\" and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. \nFor example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. \nWe have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we \nrecently received: \nThe data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, \"see the \nattached flight records,\" for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is \nthat a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense \ncounsel. \nThe load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the \nnative files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively \nmeans that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. \nRelated, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers \nand no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the \nnative files, it would be impossible. \nSo the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get \na similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million \ndocuments without much rhyme or reason. \nI've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-\nkeeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW \nreturns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, March 04, 2020 16:36 \nTo: \nCc: \n>; \n(USANYS) \n• \nSubject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents \n(USANYS) \n1S; \nHere is a  listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review.
