That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate statement; I don't \nbelieve this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your client has a desire to \ncooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to whether he is in fact willing \nto speak with us. \nRegards, \nFrom: Gary Bloxsome \nSent: Monday, January 27, 2020 13:44 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: U.S. Department of Justice investigation \nThe press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has \ndisclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and and \n; Daniel Cundy ; Jennifer Richardson \nIt has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the \nSouthern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate with the \nongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to do so. \nWe are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to advise \nthe Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation.
