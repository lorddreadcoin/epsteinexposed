Frequently. there is a need for expert witness work prior to a case going to trial and during the trial. When appropriate. \nand pursuant to guidelines implemented by the Department of Justice, a USAO may enter into contracts with expert witnesses, \nfunctioning as independent contractors, to conduct record reviews and data analyses in preparation for testimony in person or by \nwritten report and to provide such testimony in court or by trial deposition. In this particular case, the USAO has determined that \nan expert witness is necessary to testify in litigation for the government and such services are not available from the agency being \nrepresented or from another agency. \nThrough this statement of work, the USAO is seeking the services of a contractor to review records, analyze data, interview witnesses. \nprepare testimony, testify, and other work pertinent to the case. \nRetention \nThe contractor will be available to commence work for the USAO upon receipt of an executed copy of this contract or a verbal notice \nto proceed. The contractor agrees not to work for any other person or party involved in this case on matters relating to this case for \nthirty (30) days after he/she is verbally retained, or upon acceptance of this contract, unless notified earlier by the USAO. Should the \nthirty (30) days lapse without receipt of an executed contract or notice to proceed, the contractor is free to accept work from any other \nParty-\nScopestWork \nThe contractor shall: \nProvide all plant. labor, material and equipment except as otherwise provided to perform expert witness services as required by USAO \nand in connection with such services agrees to perform such document review, studies and research so as to be able to testify in person \nor by written report as an expert witness with respect to the contractor's findings. \nTestify as an expert witness during the trial either in person or by written report. unless notified to the contrary by the AUSA, and \nmust be willing to comply with all requirements of the court as well as local and/or federal rules for such purpose. \nAssist the USAO in the obtaining of one or more additional expert witnesses, as needed to support the testimony of the contractor \nin person or by written report. who are competent and willing to render a scientifically-supportable opinion and sign an appropriate \naffidavit, acceptable to the expert. prepared by the USAO, based upon the findings of the expert and the facts of the Case. \nExercise neutrality and maintain independence. The contractor shall determine the manner in which the services are to be performed \nand the specific hours to be worked by the contractor except when the contractor's testimony is required at a specific time and place. \nBe of good professional standing and moral character, generally board eligible or board certified in the area of specialty or having \nother appropriate qualifications through training or experience; to act as the USAO's expert witness in the Case, the rendering of oral \nand written opinions, the signing of affidavits, giving depositions or courtroom testimony under oath and directly consulting with the \nUSAO. \n3502-007 \nPage 6 of 19 \nEFTA00026944\n\n15JA5421P00000117 \nPage 7 of 19 \nThe full scope of contractor's work will be determined as the matter proceeds, and will be subject to the needs and requests of the \nUSAO. Occasionally the complexity of the case requires more review hours than initially estimated. Any time it becomes apparent \nto the contractor that he/she will need to exceed the time and cost estimates provided to complete his/her work, he/she will provide the \nUSAO with a revised estimate and shall proceed only after being granted permission by the USAO. \nSpecific deliverables known at this time include: \nIn United States v. Maxwell. the Government has charged the defendant with various crimes related to the sexual abuse of mionrs. The \nGovernment anticipates that this case will proceed of trial. At trial, Dr. Rocchio will serve as a testifying expert to explain various \ntopics related sexual abuse and trauma. Specifically, Dr. Rocchio will serve as a testifying expert, based on her professional \nexperience and research, regarding the psychology of sexual abuse, including by explaining the following concepts: grooming, \ndelayed reporting of child sexual abuse, attachments that form between abusers and victims of sexual abuse, and the effects of sexual \nabuse on memory. \nIn advance of her trial testimony. Dr. Rocchio will meet with the Government for preparation sessions; assist the Government in \nresponding to motions related to her expert testimony, as needed: and review any materials provided by the Government, or other \nrelevant materials relevant to the above subject matters as necessary in advance of her testimony. \nDr. Rocchio shall be compensated at a rate of $450 per hour to perform the work described above, including travel time. \nThis list of deliverables may not be all inclusive; additional deliverables may be identified by the USAO throughout the duration of \nthis contract. \nFAR 31.205.46 Travel Costs. When travel is authorized by the Government. transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses \nwill be reimbursed in accordance with conditions set out in the Federal Travel Regulation (Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations). \nRates listed elsewhere in this contract for mileage and per diem are subject to change and will be reimbursed in accordance with the \nrates established by the Federal Travel Regulation. Federal Travel Regulations may be found at this address: http://www.gsa.gov/. \nOption to Extend Term of the Contract \nThe Government may unilaterally extend the term of this contract by written notice to the contractor provided the Government does so \nbefore the contract expires. If any such extension causes an increase in the cost of performance on the contractor then the contractor \nmay, within 30 days, request an equitable adjustment in the contract price. The Government shall make an equitable adjustment in the \ncontract price and modify the contract to reflect the adjustment for all fair and reasonable requests. The total duration of this contract, \nincluding unilateral extensions, may extend no longer than 90 days beyond disposition of the Case. \nRelationship of the Parties \nNotwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of this contract the contractor shall be and act as an independent contractor \nand not an employee of the USAO, thereby incurring all expenses associated with the work, including any overhead and other direct \ncosts. The USAO will not provide fringe benefits, including health insurance benefits, paid vacations, or any other employee benefit, \nfor the contractor. The contractor shall make no representation as an agent, employee, partner. or joint venturer of USAO. The \ncontractor shall have no authority to bind nor attempt to bind USAO or incur other obligations on behalf of USAO. The contractor is \nan independent contractor and is solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory or contractual obligations of any \nsort, including, but not limited to, Workers' Compensation Insurance; and the contractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold USAO \nharmless from any and all claims, damages, liability, attorneys' fees and expenses on account of an alleged failure by the contractor to \nsatisfy any such obligations or any other obligation (under this contract or otherwise). If the contractor is a corporation, it will ensure \nthat its employees and agents are bound in writing to the contractor's obligations under this Contract. \nConfidentiality \nThe contractor recognizes that the USAO has and will have law enforcement interests, as well as non-privileged information obtained \nfrom federal agencies and employees, and other proprietary information (collectively \"information\") which are valuable, special and \nunique assets of the USAO. The contractor agrees that other than provided by law, he/she will at no time or under any circumstances, \ndirectly, or indirectly, divulge, disclose, or communicate information to a third party, or use it for its own benefit without the prior \nwritten permission from the USAO. The contractor may disclose information to its employees and subcontractors, who may be \nworking on the case, in order to facilitate the testimony to be provided by the expert in person or by written report, unless notified \nto the contrary by the USAO. The contractor and its employees and subcontractors will protect the information and treat it as strictly \nconfidential. \n3502-007 \nPage 7 of 19 \nEFTA00026945\n\n15JA5421P00000117 Page 8 of 19 \nIn the performance of services under this contract, the contractor, its employees and/or its subcontractors may be required to perform \noperations, have access to. or handle data which contain sensitive, proprietary, or privacy information or data such as. but not limited \nto, review or an individuals' tax records or medical records (such as patient files or prescription records) or other materials containing \nindividual tax or medical information (such as medical utilization reports from carriers, workers' compensation claim files, personnel \ntiles, or court records which include medical or tax reports). The contractor agrees that the following additional safeguards apply to \nsuch information: \nThe contractor shall be responsible for safeguarding the information or data while under the control of or available to the contractor \nand to prevent it from being compromised. altered, damaged, lost, or improperly disseminated. The contractor shall use such \ninformation solely for purposes of the particular court case. \nAccess to any such information or document should be strictly limited to persons with a legitimate and compelling need for that \ninformation, such as support staff needed to assist in the preparation of testimony in person or by written report. The Contractor shall \nensure that any such persons use such information solely or purposes of the particular court case and protect the confidentiality of such \ninformation. \nThe contractor shall ensure that all records are maintained securely so that access is strictly limited. \nAt the end of the contractor's engagement in this matter, all copies of such records shall be returned to the USAO. \nAll questions about these safeguards and the records which they cover shall be directed to the AUSA. \nThe confidentiality provisions of this contract shall survive any termination of this contract. \nConflict of Interest \nThe contractor warrants that he/she is under no obligation to any other entity that in any way conflicts with this contract, that he/she \nis free to enter into this contract, and is under no obligation to consult for others in matters covered by this contract. The contractor \nshall not, during the term of this contract, perform consulting services for others in any related or similar cases within the scope of this \ncontract but shall have the right to perform consulting services for others outside the scope of this contract. \nIf. for any reason, the USAO or the contractor determines that the contractor and/or an employee or subcontractor of the contractor \nfaces a potential, perceived, or real conflict of interest, the USAO shall notify the contractor or the contractor shall notify the USAO \nof the potential, perceived, or real conflict of interest and the contractor and/or contract employee or subcontractor shall cease all work \non or reassign the task or proceed at the discretion of the USAO. At the USAO's option. the contractor may provide an acceptable \nreplacement. \nGovernment Liability \nThe United States, its agents. agencies, departments. employees, and/or contracting officials shall not be liable for any injury to the \ncontractor, its subcontractors, agents, personnel. or damage to the contractor property unless the injury or damage is due to negligence \non the USAO's part and may be recoverable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. \nReturn of Records \nUpon termination of this contract, the contractor will deliver all records, notes, data or memorandum that was received from the \nUSAO. and are in the contractor's possession or under the contractor's control and are the USAO's property or relates to the USAO's \nbusiness. The contractor may properly destroy this material upon permission of the USAO. \nEOUSA Al-10-1C Data Security Contract Clause for Contracts Involving the Pll of 25 or Fewer Individuals (July 2016) \nData Security Contract Clause for Contracts Involving the PII of 25 or Fewer Individuals (July 2016) \nThe following clause applies to all contracts involving the personally identifiable information (PH) of 25 or fewer individuals. P11 \nrefers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as his or her name, social security number, \nbiometric records. etc., whether alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a \nspecific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name. etc. P11 is defined at this link: \nhttplAvww.gsa.gov/portal/content/104256. \n3502-007 \nPage 8 of 19 \nEFTA00026946\n\n15JA5421P00000117 Page 9 of 19 \nContractors using information systems that are subject to the data security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) already are subject to the data security standards outlined below, and, therefore, only paragraphs \n(g), (h), and (i) apply. \n(a) Contractors must ensure that computer hardware is secure and shall take the steps outlined below: \n(I) Keep your firewall turned on: A firewall helps protect your computer from hackers who might try to gain access \nto crash it, delete information, or even steal passwords or other sensitive information. Software firewalls are widely \nrecommended for single computers. The software is prepackaged on some operating systems or can be purchased \nfor individual computers. For multiple networked computers, hardware routers typically provide firewall protection, \nalthough the contractor must verify this. \n(2) Computers must be protected by username/password logins and password-protected screensavers (after 15-\nmin. idle). Computer accounts cannot be shared with other users. Contractors must report an incident to the EOUSA \nSecurity Operations Center at within one hour if their account is accessed by another user. \n(3) Install and update your antivirus software: Antivirus software is designed to prevent malicious software \nprograms from embedding in your computer. If it detects malicious code, like a virus or a worm, it works to disarm or \nremove it. Viruses can infect computers without users' knowledge. Most types of antivirus software can be set up to \nupdate automatically. \n(4) Install and update your antispyware technology: Spyware is just what it sounds like—software that is \nsurreptitiously installed on your computer to let others peer into your activities on the computer. Some spyware \ncollects information about you without your consent or produces unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser. Some \noperating systems offer free spyware protection, and inexpensive software is readily available for download on the \nInternet or at your local computer store. Be wary of ads on the Internet offering downloadable antispyware—in some \ncases these products may be fake and may actually contain spyware or other malicious code. \n(5) Maintain active and supported operating systems and application software. Computer operating systems (e.g., \nWindows 8.0) and application software (e.g., Microsoft Word) have a lifecycle that begins when a product is released \nand ends when it's no longer supported. Install and maintain security updates and fixes updated to stay in tune with \ntechnology requirements and to fix security holes. Be sure to install the updates to ensure your computer has the latest \nprotection. \n(6) Be careful what you download: Carelessly downloading e-mail attachments can circumvent even the most vigilant \nanti-virus software. Never open an e-mail attachment from someone you don't know and be wary of fonvarded \nattachments from people you do know. They may have unwittingly advanced malicious code. \n(7) Turn off your computer: With the growth of high-speed Internet connections, many opt to leave their computers \non and ready for action. The downside is that being \"always on\" renders computers more susceptible. Beyond firewall \nprotection, which is designed to fend off unwanted attacks, turning the computer off effectively severs an attacker's \nconnection—be it spyware or a botnet that employs your computer's resources to reach out to other unwitting users. \n(b) You must encrypt files related to this project on your computer whenever you are not working on them using \na standard software encryption product such as Winzip (Version 18.5 or later with the Windows FIPS 140-2 validated \ncryptographic modules enabled). Securezip. or any other product that meets Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) \n140-2. If you do not already have a suitable encryption program on your computer, you can download one of these products \neasily. \n(c) If the data under this contract will be accessed by more than one person, rules of behavior must be signed by users. \nThese rules shall address at a minimum: authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of \nsensitive data and PH. You can comply by having all users sign these rules: I. Keep all data and information received from \nthe government confidential. 2. Do not leave it unattended in a place where an unauthorized person might read, copy, or take \nit. 3. Do not transmit it without encryption from one computer to another. 4.
