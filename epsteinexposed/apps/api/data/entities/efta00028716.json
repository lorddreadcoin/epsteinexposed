In particular, he is listed as a passenger on at \nleast eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed \nas having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric. On one \nflight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, \nTrump, and then-20-year-old On two other flights, two of the passengers, \nrespectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case. We've just finished reviewing the full \nrecords (more than 100 pages of very small script) and didn't want any of this to be a surprise down the road. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00028716",
