Just to \nbe clear, we take absolutely no position on any State Department or other extra-judicial processes relating to Mr. Epstein \n—I'm sending this publicly-filed document just as a courtesy. I don't know if individuals have any due process or any other \nrights in connection with their passports (and have never previously had a defendant who had his or her passport revoked \nupon arrest and/or detention), and so do not have any view or position on the determinations of any other department or \nagency. All that said, the order is attached, which I hope that is useful. \nthank you, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 15:50 \nSubject: RE: Epstein Passport \nWould you be able to send me a copy of the detention order? Consular Affairs will use the order to revoke his passport. \nEven though he is incarcerated, the State Department would like to revoke his U.S. passport. \nThanks. \n• \nEFTA00018438\n\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge \nNew York Field Office \nU.S. Department of State \nDiplomatic Security Service \nOfficial \nUNCLASSIFIED \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 10, 2019 10:13 PM \nSubject: RE: Epstein Passport \n■ \nHappy to be in touch — let us know what info we can provide or how we can be of help. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nu ject: pstein assport \n■ \nCc'ed to this email is the prosecution team for the Epstein case. \nTeam, \nPlease meet an ASAC at the DSS NY Field Office (and my former boss). \nState Department's Consular Affairs Bureau is looking for some information regarding Epstein's passport, as they \nconsidering revoking it.
