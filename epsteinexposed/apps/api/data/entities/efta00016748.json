Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n500 Pearl Street \nNew York, New York 10007 \nThe Silvio J. Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nJuly 16, 2019 \nREQUEST TO FILE PARTIALLY \nUNDER SEAL \nRe: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear Judge Berman: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to provide the Court with additional \ninformation in response to the Court's questions at the detention hearing held on July 15, 2019 \n(the \"Detention Hearing\"). \nI. Payments to Potential Witnesses' \nIn a  July 12, 2019 letter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had \nrecently obtained records from a financial institution (\"Institution-1\") that appeared to show the \ndefendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on \napproximately November 28, 2018, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual \nmisconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a  non-prosecution agreement \n(\"NPA\") with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2007. The same \nseries highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein's former employees and associates in the \nalleged sexual abuse. At the Detention Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide \nadditional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made. \nFirst, records from Institution-1 show that on or about November 30, 2018, or two days \nafter the series in the Miami Herald be:an, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he \ncontrolled to , an individual named as \na  potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA. This \nindividual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series. \nSecond, the same records show that just three days later on or about December 3, 2018, \nthe defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to , who \nwas \nFor the reasons set forth at the Detention Hearing, and with the consent of the Court, the \nGovernment is redacting the identities of these individuals in the publicly filed version of this \nletter. \nEFTA00016748\n\nHon. Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 16, 2019 \nPage 2 \nalso named as a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in—the \nNPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that \nshe and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among \nother things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his \nresidences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured \nprominently in the Herald series. \nII. Police Report \nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a  redacted copy of a  Palm Beach \npolice report, which was annexed to the Government's July 12, 2019 detention memorandum. At \nthe Court's request, the Government has provided a  supplemental copy of the police report \npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the \npolice report is attached as Exhibit A. \nIII. Foreign Passport \nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it  had recently \nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the \n\"Foreign Passport\") from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence during the execution of a \nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2019. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to \ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto \nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States \npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign \nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the \nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits \nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the \nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under \nseal. \nThe Government is attempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport, \nincluding how it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the \ndefendant's possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to \nthe inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, \nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.' \nThe Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has \nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To \ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen \nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming \nevidence of risk of flight. \nEFTA00016749\n\nHon. Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nJuly 16, 2019 \nPage 3 \nIV. Cash and Diamonds \nAt the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash \nwere seized from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence. The Court inquired as to the value \nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials \nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $70,000 in cash. In \naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately 1  carat \nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether \nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other \nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the \njurisdiction at a moment's notice. \nV. \nConclusion \nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government's July 8, 2019 and July 12, 2019 \ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the \ndefendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the \npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued \nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. \nRespectfully submitted, \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  /s \nI / \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nCc: , counsel for defendant \nEFTA00016750",
