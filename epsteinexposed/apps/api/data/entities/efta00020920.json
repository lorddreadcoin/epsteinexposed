The FBI has emailed and left \nmessages with your legal department several times over the past weeks without a response. \nPlease respond promptly to resolve Amazon's non-compliance. Otherwise we will initiate contempt proceedings \nregarding your failure to comply with valid legal process. \nSincerely, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nEFTA00020920\n\nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00020921",
