Attached is a revised draft for your review. Should I plan to send this to after I get back your next \nedits? I gave him a heads up that I was hoping to send it to him later today. Separately, I have been thinking a bit more \nabout the documents that we are planning to attach as exhibits, and I was hoping that we could discuss as a team with \nyou both. I was hoping to do that before I reach out to to let her know our plan. I'm available for a call \nwhenever is best for others today. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, February 20, 2021 6:02 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Motions to Suppress \nReally nice work on this. Some combined comments in track. Would love to see again after you've had a  chance to \nreview/clean up and, of course, happy to discuss in the interim. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, February 18, 2021 4:44 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Motions to Suppress \n•,\n>; \nAttached is a draft of the opposition to the defense's suppression motions (motions 3 and 11), which are attached here for \nreference. I wrote this as one section with several subheadings since I think the issues are entangled (and that helps \nexplain the length of this), but happy to discuss further. edits are incorporated in this draft. \nThanks, \nEFTA00021377",
