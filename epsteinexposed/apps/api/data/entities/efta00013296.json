I am \nassuming that you would like to remove the Florida scanned data that is currently in Relativity and replace it with the new \ndata that the vendor sent to us correct? \nThank you. \nFrom:\nSent: Friday, December 11, 2020 10:28 AM \nTo: \nSubject: portal access (v2) \nhas shared the \nfolder SDNY with you. \nNote From \nGood morning \nI'm trying to send you the portal access again.
