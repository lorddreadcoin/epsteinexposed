I just spoke with the Associate General Counsel at the USMS, who wanted to provide us with the \nactual source materials (USM lls (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in all \ncircumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our \ninvestigation from the release, that we have the original materials. He also offered to serve as a POC if we have any \nquestions. \nChief, Criminal Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office, SDNY \nEFTA00029311",
