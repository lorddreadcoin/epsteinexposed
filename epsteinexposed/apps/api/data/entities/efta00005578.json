My name is \nand I am an Assistant United States Attorney \nhere in the \nSouthern District of New York. \nCan everyone \nhear me okay? All right. I SP \neverybody's heads nodding. \nThank you. \nI am here today to present for your consideration \na proposed superseding indictment \ncharging Ghislaine Maxwell \nin six counts. This \nindictment is virtually identical to \nthe indictment that you returned last \nweek charging Maxwell \nin those same six counts except that it corrects two \nclerical errors, or two typographical errors that \nwere \ncontained in Counts Five and Six \nwhich are the perjury \ncharges. \nAs a result, I \nwill not be presenting any new \nevidence or new witnesses today. \nInstead, I will identify \nfor you those two clerical \nerrors in the indictment. I will \npoint out the portion of the exhibits that you saw last week \nthat provide the \ncorrect information. Then I will identify \nthe corrected portion of the superseding \nindictment in the \nproposed superseding \nindictment. \nBefore I do that though, I must ask you all the \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.

I see \nno \nhands. \nNext, have you any heard or read about, or learned \nanything Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey \nEpstein or anyone else \nrelated to this case, if you could just raise your hand? I \nsee a number of hands. \nVirtually every hand is in the air. \nYou can all put your hands down. \nThank you. \nAs you know, you must make your determination as a \ngrand jury based on the evidence presented before you in the \ngrand jury, in this \nroom alone. Accordingly, you must set \naside any other knowledge you may have about this case or \nthe people involved in it, and base your decision solely on \nthe evidence presented to this grand jury to determine \nwhether there is probable cause to believe that the charges \nin the \nproposed indictment were committed. \nIs there any grand juror here today who cannot \nfollow these instructions? I see no hands. Just to be \nsure, is there any grand juror here who \nwould have any \ndifficulty setting aside the outside information you may \nhave about the defendant or \nthe facts of this case? I se= \nno \nhands. \nFinally, do any of \nyou believe you know me \nin\nanything other \nthan my professional capacity? I see no \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.

Instead I will present you with \nthe \nexhibits from \nlast week, the transcript of the testimony you \nheard from last week and the proposed superseding \nindictment. I will then walk you \nthrough the error that the \nsuperseding indictment seeks to correct. \nPlease \nkeep in mind though that what I say is not \nevidence. Only the testimony of the witnesses and the \nexhibits are evidence. So as I'm walking you through these \nexhibits, your understanding of them and your understanding \nof the evidence controls. I am just trying to provide you \nwith an overview. \nWith that instruction in mind, I am going to put \nup onto the Elmo what was previously received and marked as \nGrand Jury \nExhibit 1. That is the proposed six-count \nindictment that you voted to return last week. A copy of it \nwill be available for \nreview when you deliberate. \nYou also received what has been marked as Grand \nJury Exhibit 2, which I will not put up on the Elmo. That \nwas a PowerPoint presentation containing photographs and \nexcerpts of certain documents that was shown to you during \nthe testimony last week. You also \nheard testimony from FBI \nSpecial \nAgent \nToday I am \nmarking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 3, \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.

It is up on tnr \nElmo now and it will be available for you to review \nif you \nwould like as you deliberate. I will not read it back to \nyou now, but you can read through it as you deliberate. \nFinally, I am marking, as Grand Jury Exhibit 4, \nthe proposed superseding \nindictment, which I have now placed \nup on the \nElmo. As I mentioned, this proposed superseding \nindictment corrects two clerical errors and is otherwise \nidentical to the original \nindictment, Grand Jury Exhibit 1. \nI'm now going to walk you \nthrough the errors that \nwe're going to \ncorrect starting on Grand \nJury Exhibit \n1. \nPage 15 contains the \nbeginning of Count Five which charges \nMaxwell with perjury. Paragraph 21 \non that page refers to \nthe civil case in which \nMaxwell gave deposition testimony on \nApril 22nd, 2016, as 15 Civ. 7344. That \nis the error we are \ngoing to correct. \nSimilarly, page 16 \ncontains the beginning of Count \nSix which charges \nanother count of perjury. Paragraph 23 on \nthat page refers to the \ncivil case in which Maxwell gave \ndeposition testimony on July 22nd, 2016, under \nthe same \nnumber, 15 \nCiv. 7344. \nTurning now to Grand Jury Exhibit 2. Slide 22 of \nthat exhibit contains the first page of the deposition \ntranscript from the testimony that Maxwell \ngave on \nApril 22nd, 2016. As you \ncan see here, the docket number \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.

As you can see here, again, the docket number for \nthat case is 15 Civ. 7433 \nnot 7344. \nFinally, I will \nturn to the proposed \nindictment, \nGrand \nJury Exhibit 4. On page 15, you have again the same \nperjury count with one change. Paragraph 21 corrects the \ndocket number for the civil case to be 15 Civ. 7433. \nSimilarly, on page 16, which \ncontains the second \nperjury count for the July 22nd, 2016 deposition, the docket \nnumber is corrected to 15 Civ. 7433. There \nare otherwise no \nchanges to the substance of this indictment. \nThat is my \npresentation. Before I leave you to \ndeliberate, would anyone like me to read the full proposed \nsuperseding indictment out loud? I see no hands. \nI must advise you that you must independently find \nprobable cause, again, for each count in the superseding \nindictment. The evidence before you in support of the \ncharges in the superseding indictment is the same evidence \nthat was before you when you considered the indictment last \nweek. \nDoes anyone have any \nquestions about that \nevidence? I \nsee no hands. \nThe \nlegal instructions that you received before \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.

Would anyone like me to read those instructions \nout loud for you again? I see no hands. \nDoes anyone have any questions about the legal \ninstructions? I see no hands. \nI will leave you now \nwith the exhibits to \ndeliberate. As always, if you have any questions or \nconcerns about the proposed indictment, please let me kno.v, \nbefore you vote so that I may answer any questions you may \nhave on the law, \nor bring any additional evidence before you \nto consider. \nThank you, all. \n(Matter concluded) \n(Time \nNoted: 10:14 a.m.) \nFREE STATE REPORTING, INC. \nCourt Reporting Transcription \nD.C.
