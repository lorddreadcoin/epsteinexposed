I was working the rear gate area when the gate pass inmate named brought \nback to the gate bays of shredded papers to throw out into the dumpster on Thursday and one bag on Friday. He stated \nthat members of the BOP after action team that were investigating what happened with the Epstein suicide were \nshredding boxes of paperwork. He stated, \"they are shredding everything\". He stated that he even was told to help them \nshred paperwork too. I believe that this conduct maybe inappropriate for a investigative team to be shredding \npaperwork related to the investigation and you may want to investigate why BOP employees were destroying records. \nEFTA00031633",
