And that also sounds helpful re: an agenda, we'll look out for that \ntomorrow evening and be ready to chat on Monday at 8:00. \nthanks, \nFrom: Weingarten, Reid \nSent: Saturday, July 13, 2019 14:17 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: U.S. v.

And we'll be in the \nbest position to be able to talk productively if you could give us a general sense of what you'd like to address? \nAlso, if you could please include and on any communications—I know it's often convenient to just hit \nreply but we want to make sure we're all in the loop since parts of the team will be more and less available at various \ntimes if and when you reach out. \nthanks, \nFrom: Weingarten, Reid \nSent: Saturday, July 13, 2019 12:05 \nTo: \nSubject: Re: U.S. v.
