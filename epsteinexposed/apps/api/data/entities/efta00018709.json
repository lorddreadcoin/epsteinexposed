Menninger \nHADDON, MORGAN & FOREMAN P.C. \nAttorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell \nEFTA00018709\n\nINTRODUCTION \nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third \nMotion for Release on Bail. \nAs Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no \nintention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States \nfor 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country. \nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court \ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the \n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to \nour knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her \nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court's denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms. \nMaxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily \nrestrictive bail package she has already offered. \n• First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate \nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires. \n• Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse's assets—excluding funds \nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to \ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and \nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal \nDistrict Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset \nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account. \nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed \ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to \nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at 11-13). As a non-citizen, Ms. \nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to \n2 \nEFTA00018710\n\ncitizens of those countries. The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell's assets so they \ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should \nsatisfy the Court's concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets \nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at 17-18). \nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial \nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or \nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail \napplication (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the \nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of \nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government's case \nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention. \nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She \nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has \npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly \nattacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have \nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt \nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined — \nand welcomes the opportunity —  to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional \nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should \ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare \nfor trial. \n3 \nEFTA00018711\n\nI. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will \nReasonably \nAssure Ms. Maxwell's \nAppearance in Court \nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate \nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore \nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v. \nRowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (IA] release \norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to \nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.\"); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-\nLTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting \"Court's inherent authority for \nreconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision\"). \nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship \nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide \nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is \nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should \nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the \nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell's \npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made. \nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally \ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the \nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately \nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate, \nmay be expedited. \nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell's decision to give up \ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her \n4 \nEFTA00018712\n\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to \nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense. \nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court's concerns about the validity of \nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. 106 at 13). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest \nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any \nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. \nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets \nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. \nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could \nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at 17-18). To assuage any concerns that \nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell \nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are \nnot used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for \nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. \n1. New Account \nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in \nescrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in \nthe name of Ms. Maxwell's spouse (\"the Personal Account\")', will be deposited in a newly \ncreated account (\"the New Account\") to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to \norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell's and her spouse's \nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale \n1 The Personal Account is identified as Account Ion page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell's \nRenewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit 0.) \n5 \nEFTA00018713\n\nof Ms. Maxwell's London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired. \nThe asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and \nmust approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of \ndisbursements for Ms. Maxwell's legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil \nlitigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization. No illiquid assets may \nbe sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor. \n2. Other Assets \nThe only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (I) the money currently \nheld in escrow by Ms. Maxwell's attorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and \n(2) the roughly $450,000 in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living \nexpenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal \nAccount, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive \nfive-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount \nexceeding $5,000, and the reason for such payment. Ms. Maxwell's spouse agrees to be bound \nby these restrictions and reporting requirements. \nThe asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or \ndisbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above. \n3. Selected Asset Monitor \nThe Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the \nformer United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the \nposition of asset monitor. (Judge Duffey's bio is attached as Exhibit A.) Judge Duffey has \nextensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial \n6 \nEFTA00018714\n\naccounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her \nspouse, as described above. \nRestraining Ms. Maxwell's assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under \nthe supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds \ncould be \nused to violate the terms of release. \nH. Ms. Maxwell's Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues \nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her \nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial \nmotions now before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government's case. \nMs. Maxwell's pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of \ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the \nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay, \nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell's \nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of \nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious \nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These \nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government's case and warrant \ngranting bail on the conditions proposed. \nIII. The Court Should Grant Bail \nUnder the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant must be released on personal \nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines \"that such release \nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of \nany other person or the community.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b). The enhanced bail package proposed \nby Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably \n7 \nEFTA00018715\n\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3142(e), \nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if \nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this \npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what \nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no \ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To \nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States \ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for \nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old \nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.' \nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package \npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms. \nMaxwell's presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral \npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of \nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds \ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and \nformer United States Attorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the \ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly \n2  See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf. People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, \n02526/201I(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a \nParis-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including \nfelony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel \nhousekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn's DNA \non the accuser's uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-\nhour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his \nFrench passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a \nresidence in Manhattan. See https://www.theguardian.comAvorld/20  may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-\napartment. \n8 \nEFTA00018716\n\naffirm Ms. Maxwell's earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee. \nThe Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. \nCONCLUSION \nThe proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and \nrestraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already \nextraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell's Renewed Motion for Bail. \nIn combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms. \nMaxwell's appearance at trial. To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and \nrestrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice. \nDated: February 23, 2021 \nRespectfully submitted, \ngaga \nC. \nSitiaao. \nBobbi C.
