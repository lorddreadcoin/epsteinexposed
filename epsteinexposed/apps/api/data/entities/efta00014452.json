    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n86 Chambers Siren \nNew York. New York 10007 \nAugust 3, \n2020 \nBy Electronic Mail \nRobert Glassman, Esq. \nPanish Shea & Boyle LLP \n11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 700 \nLos An eles CA 90025 \nRe: Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Mr. Glassman: \nI write in response to your letter dated June 8, 2020, seeking documents from the \nDepartment of Justice (\"DOJ\") related to Jeffrey Epstein and plaintiff Jane Doe in Jane Doe v. \nIndyke et at, No. 20-cv-484 (S.D.N.Y.). Because your request seeks information from \nDepartment of Justice (the \"Department\") employees acquired during and as part of their \nperformance of their official duties, your request is governed by certain Department \nregulations—commonly referred to as Told°, regulations—which, inter alia, prohibit any \nDepartment employee from disclosing such information \"without prior approval of the proper \nDepartment official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this part.\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a); \nsee also United States ex reL Told°, v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq. \nThe \"proper official\" in this case is Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York. \nThe applicable Touhy regulations direct the Department to consider inter alia, \"[w]hether \n... disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which \nthe demand arose.\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1). The Department understands that there is an initial \npretrial conference scheduled for August 5, 2020, in Doe v. Indyke and that the parties in that \nmatter have already exchanged discovery demands and responses. See Scheduling Order dated \nJuly 21, 2020, ECF No. 57, Doe v. Indyke et aL, No. 20-cv-484 (S.D.N.Y.). In light of the \npotential for formal discovery demands to issue in connection with Doe v. hidyke, the \nDepartment has determined that disclosures in response to your pending request are appropriate \nat this time and in lieu of any formal discovery request. \nThe applicable Touhy regulations forbid, inter alia, \"[d]isclosure [which] would violate a \nstatute . . . or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule,\" 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(1). \nAccordingly, the Department cannot provide any documents in its possession governed by the \ngrand jury secrecy rules set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). See 28 U.S.C. § \n16.26(b)(1). \nMindful of these considerations, the Acting United States Attorney has authorized the \nDepartment to provide certain documents responsive to your request. Please find electronic \nversions of these documents enclosed. The password for these documents will be sent to you by \nseparate cover. \nEFTA00014452\n\nPage 2 \nThe enclosed documents are as follows: \n• Pages numbered USDOL0001-0040 are invoices from FedEx Corporation that \nreference your client. Information therein has been redacted to exclude references \nto third parties. \n• Pages numbered USDOL0041-0052 are documents obtained through electronic \nsearch warrants that reference your client. Information therein has been redacted \nto exclude references to third parties. \n• The page number \nUSDOJ_0053 \nis a photo depicting your client obtained through \na physical search of Jeffrey Epstein's residence. \nPlease contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to \ndiscuss the issues herein further. \nSincerely, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nActing United States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York \nBy: / \nAssistant United States Attorney \nEFTA00014453",
