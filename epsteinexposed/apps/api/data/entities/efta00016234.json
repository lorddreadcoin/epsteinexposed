We'll incorporate this information into the investigation and \ncertainly will follow up as appropriate. Thanks again, both for the initial information and for following up. \nbest, \nFrom: John Ray <john@raymitevlaw.com> \nSent: Friday, March 27, 2020 19:37 \nTo: \nSubject: Re: Epstein investigation \nDear both I and my life partner are the sources of info. She isMadeleine Kristoffersson. Her tel # is \nShe lives in with me.Most of what we know about her is from \npersonal knowledge. The rest is from social media. A great deal of social media was taken away right after she \nbecame controversial. They scrubbed the internet . Epstein was her \"BBB\" Man of the Year in 2002. He paid her \n$150,000 through two shell entities for her girls. We do not know the ages of the various women. We did not \nbecome familiar with the women. We ask for confidentiality for Madeleine. Madeleine , who is an opera singer, \nonce sang for a BBB function. Enough social media, however, remains, and seems useful. We do not know all \nthe sordid details, but we were never aware of any rules or age restrictions she imposed. I guess our point in \ncontacting you was because we assumed that she is a person of interest and we know that she slipped into the US \nafter hiding out in Stockholm. So we were trying to help before she went back out of reach to \nStockholm.Sincerely, John Ray ps, we are sending along various photos of BBB girls , always teamed up with \nold men. , including Hazeltine.These photos we captured beforeBarbru cleansed them from the Internet. \nOn Fri, Mar 27, 2020 at 4:38 PM \nJohn, \n> wrote: \nWanted to get back to you regarding your letter of March 9, 2020, which we received via the Eastern District \nU.S. Attorney's Office, and your follow-up call this week, both of which we appreciate. We did receive the \nletter, and in the first instance it would be helpful to know the name and contact info of the person who's the \nsource of this information (assuming it is someone other than you) —  we ordinarily pass this kind of \ninformation to the FBI for initial response, but it's not clear from the letter whom they would be in touch with \nto follow up. It would also be helpful to know, if you're aware, whether there is any allegation that the \nrelevant interns were underage. \nthanks very much, \nEFTA00016234\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nVery truly yours, \nJohn Ray \nRay, Mitev & Associates, LLP \nNew York Attorneys \n\"Killer Bees\" \nManhattan: \n5 E 22nd Street, 17th Floor \nAt Broadway \nNew York, NY 10010 \nTel: 1-866-88 NYLAW \nLong Island: \n122 North Country Road \nMiller Place, New York 11764 \nTel: 631-473-1000 \nFax: 631-928-5385 \nIRS Circular 230 Required Notice—IRS regulations require that we inform you that to the extent this \ncommunication contains any statement regarding federal taxes, that statement was not written or \nintended to be used, and it cannot be used, by any person (i) for the purpose of avoiding federal tax \npenalties that may be imposed on that person, or (ii) to promote, market or recommend to another \nparty any transaction or matter addressed herein. \nThis communication is otherwise privileged and confidential as attorney-client communication and/or \nattorney work product and may not be used, reproduced, reformatted or in any way referred to without \nthe prior written consent of Ray, Mitev & Associates, under penalty of law.
