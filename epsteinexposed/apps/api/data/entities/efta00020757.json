I was molested by \nJeffrey Epstein as a minor \non dozens of \noccasions in his \nmansion in Palm Beach, \nFlorida from \naround 2002 \nto 2005. I understand \nthat evidence collected from \nMr. Epstein's \nhome showed \nconclusively that I was there as \na minor, along with \nmany other underage \ngirls. Given how many girls Epstein \nwas \nabusing, there \ncould not have been any doubt \nin anyone's mind that \nhad \naccess to the testimonial and \nother evidence that Epstein \nmolested me (and many others). \n3. I cooperated fully with the \nFBI while they investigated Epstein's \nillegal activities with minors. \n4. During the investigation, \nEpstein had investigators following and \nharassing me. I continued to \ncooperate with the investigation \ndespite this intimidation. \n5. In late 2007, \nFBI agents met in person with me. \nDuring this \nmeeting, the \nagents explained that Epstein was \nalso being charged \nin State court and \nmay plea to state charges \nrelated to some of his \nother victims. I \nknew the State charges had \nnothing to do with me. \nDuring this meeting, the \nAgents did not explain that an \nagreement \nhad already \nbeen signed that precluded any \nprosecution of Epstein \nfor \nfederal charges against me. I did not get the \nopportunity to \nmeet \nor confer with the prosecuting \nattorneys about any potential \nfederal deal that related to me or the \ncrimes committed against me. \n6. My \nunderstanding of the agents' explanation was that the \nfederal \ninvestigation would continue. I also \nunderstood that my own case \nwould move forward towards \nprosecution of Epstein. \n7. \nConfirming my understanding, in about January 2008, I received a \nletter \nfrom the FBI that told me that \"this case is currently under \ninvestigation. This can be a lengthy process and we request your \ncontinued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.\" \nMy understanding of this letter was \nthat my case was still being \ninvestigated \nand the \nFBI and \nprosecutors were moving forward on \nthe Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against me. \nEFTA00020758\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 3 of 5 \n8. \nAt this \ntime, I was not \ntold about any \nnon\n-prosecution \nagreement \nor any \npotential \nresolution of the \nfederal criminal \ninvestigation I \nwas \ncooperating in. If I \nhad been told \nabout a non\n-prosecution \nagreement, I would have \nobjected. \n9. \nCriminal \nprosecution of Epstein \nfor crimes \nagainst me was \nextremely \nimportant to me. I \nwanted to be \nconsulted by the \nprosecutors before any \nresolution. In \nlight of the \nletter I had \nreceived, I \nhad confidence \nthat I would be \ncontacted by the \nfederal \ngovernment before it \nreached any final \nresolution of the \ninvestigation \ninto my case \nand that I \nwould likely be \nneeded to \ntestify \nif the case went to \ntrial, which I was \nwilling and \nanxious to \ndo. \n10. \nWhen I had \nnot heard from \nthe prosecuting \nattorney for a \nwhile, I met with \nattorney Brad Edwards \nwanting him to find \nout \nwhen \nEpstein was going to \nbe federally \ncharged and \nprosecuted for \nthe crimes he \ncommitted against me and \nothers. Epstein's \ninvestigators \nwere harassing \nme, and that \ninterfered with my life \ndramatically. My attorney, \nMr. Edwards, was \nhired to make sure \nthe prosecutor \nknew how eager I \nwas to have Jeffrey \nEpstein \nprosecuted, and I \nunderstand that he did \nconvey that to the \nprosecutors \nnumerous times in around \nJune 2008. \n11. \nAt some point, \nI understood that \nMr. Edwards was \ngetting \nresponses from the \nprosecutor that were making \nhim suspicious of \nthe \nmotivations of the U.S. \nAttorney's Office. I then \nunderstood \nthat Mr. Edwards' \nsuspicions were that \nthe prosecutors were \nconferring \nwith Epstein and not with me \nand the other victims. \n12. I authorized Mr. \nEdwards to do anything \npossible to ensure \nthat Epstein \nwas prosecuted, and that I \nwas able to meet with \nprosecutors and \nparticipate in the process. I \nagreed to file a lawsuit \nagainst the U.S. Attorney's Office \nto get them to speak with \nme \nabout any possible case \nresolution or the terms and to answer \nquestions about the case, \nand to generally treat me fairly, to notify \nme about any court \nhearing, and to otherwise enforce my \nrights as \na \ncrime victim. \nEFTA00020759\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 4 of 5 \n13. \nTowards \nthe end of \nJune, 2008, I \ndid not \nattend Jeffrey \nEpstein's guilty \nplea hearing \nin state \ncourt involving \nanother \nvictim \nof Epstein's \nabuse. I did \nnot have \nreasonable notice \nof the \nhearing, \nand I did not \nhave any reason \nto attend \nthat hearing \nbecause no one \nhad told me \nthat this guilty \nplea was related \nto the \nFBI's investigation of \nEpstein's abuse of \nme. I had always \nunderstood generally that \nthe State and \nFederal criminal \nsystems \nwere \ndifferent and that one \nhad nothing to do with \nthe other. \nBased on what the \nFBI had been \ntelling me, I thought \nthey were \nstill \ninvestigating my \ncase. If I had been told \nthat this plea had \nsome \nconnection to \nblocking the \nprosecution of my case, I \nwould \nhave attended \nand tried to object to \nthe judge and \nprevent that plea \nfrom going \nforward. Many other victims \nwould have done the \nsame. I think that after \nhearing from me and some \nof the other \ngirls who were abused by \nEpstein, a judge would \nnot have allowed \nsuch a plea deal to go \nforward. It is my belief that the US \nAttorney's Office and Epstein's \nattorneys conspired to prevent my \nattendance at \nthis hearing as well as the \nattendance of the many \nother victims. \n14. I learned about the \nexistence of a secret non-prosecution \nagreement only in July 2008, after my lawyer had filed \ncourt \npleadings trying to give me a \nchance to talk to prosecutors about \nmy \ncase. I would never have learned \nof that agreement if I had not \nauthorized \nmy attorney to sue the United States. Nobody would \nhave. \n15. I wanted to cooperate in the \nprosecution more than anything \nelse in my life; I was \nscared of Epstein; I was scared \nof what he \nhad done to me and others, and of how he was \ncontinuing to harass \nme, and also what he could do to me and others. The criminal case \nagainst Epstein \nwas my main focus \nin life. \n16. \nWhen I attended a court hearing with Mr. Edwards in federal \ncourt, I learned for the first time \nthat my rights had been \nextinguished \nthrough a \nsecret deal \nbetween the \nprosecutors \nand Mr. \nEpstein. I received no explanation about exactly how the deal \noccurred or about whether my rights were gone forever. The \nEFTA00020760\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 5 of 5 \nprosecutors were, at that \ntime, trying to even \nkeep me from \nseeing \na \ncopy of the secret plea \ndeal. I wanted to \nmeet with the \nprosecutors and tell \nthem why they \nshould prosecute my \ncase, but \nit became \nclear that without ever \ntalking to me, they had \nbargained \nmy case away. \n17. In about \n2010, I had the chance to \nmeet with the U.S. \nAttorney, Mr. Wilfredo Ferrer. \nI told him all about how I had been \nmistreated in the \nprocess. Mr. Ferrer seemed \nto be interested in \nthis, but nothing ever came of the \nmeeting. And unfortunately it \nseems to me that Mr. Ferrer's \noffice is continuing to try to \nblock \nme and \nother girls from learning \nanything about the secret deal \nwith Epstein or how our rights \nwere violated, even though they \nknow what they did was wrong. \n18. \nI later came to understand that \ncrime victims in the federal \nsystem have the right to \nmeaningfully confer with the prosecutor \nfor \nthe government in the case, \nwhich at least means to explain \nhow my \ncase would be concluded; \nthe right to be heard at \nimportant hearings; and the \nright to be treated with \"fairness.\" I \nstrongly believe that the \nway I was treated was unfair and \nviolated \nmy rights. \n19. I think that \nthe secret non-prosecution agreement should be \ndeclared \nillegal and that I should have the \nright to have crimes \nagainst me \nprosecuted by the U.S. \nAttorney's Office, and that Mr. \nEpstein should be treated the same \nas other defendants with less \nmoney and connections are treated for these \ncrimes. \n20. I declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true \nand \ncorrect to the best of my knowledge and belief. \nExecuted this \n2p. , day of January, 2015. \nEFTA00020761",
