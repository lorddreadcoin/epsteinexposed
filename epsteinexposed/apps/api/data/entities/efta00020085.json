Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nAugust 28, 2019 \nBy ECF and E-Mail \nHonorable Richard M. Berman \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \n500 Pearl Street \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) \nDear Judge Berman: \nThe Government respectfully writes in response to legal arguments raised by defense counsel \nat the August 27, 2019 hearing on the Government's nolle prosequi motion. As set forth below, \nthe Court must dismiss the Indictment where, as here, the defendant has died prior to a conviction \nbecoming final. Moreover, the Court does not have the authority, inherent or otherwise, to conduct \nits own inquiry into the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide, or to supervise the ongoing \nGrand Jury investigation. \n1. The Rule of Abatement Requires the Dismissal of the Indictment \nAs the Court is aware, clear Second Circuit precedent requires the dismissal of an \nindictment when a defendant dies before his conviction becomes final, under the \"well-settled rule \nthat actions upon penal statutes do not survive the death of the wrongdoer.\" United States v. \nWright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citation omitted). This rule applies with full \nforce here, and requires the dismissal of the Indictment. See Transcript of Aug. 27, 2019 Hearing \n(\"Tr.\") at 9 (Court noting that \"it is appropriate to conclude that if the rule of abatement applies to \na convicted defendant as in the Wright case, it  should also apply a fortiori in the Epstein case, \nwhich was still in the pretrial phase when Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction.\"); \nsee also United States v. Brooks, 872 F.3d 78, 87 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 171, 202 \nL. Ed. 2d 37 (2018) (\"This general rule, almost unanimously followed by the federal Courts of \nAppeals, has its roots in the common law doctrine of abatement ab initio: `everything associated \nwith the case is extinguished, leaving the defendant as if he had never been indicted or \nconvicted.\") (collecting cases). \n2. The Court Does Not Have the Authority to Conduct its Own Investigation \nAt yesterday's hearing, defense counsel posited that the \"court has the inherent authority \nto find out what happened on its watch,\" and asked the Court to \"supervis[e], or at least keep an \nEFTA00020085\n\nPage 2 \ninterest in these proceeding[s].\" (Tr. 17-18). Defense counsel is wrong. The Court lacks the \nconstitutional authority to supervise a  grand jury investigation or to appoint an independent \nprosecutor to investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. The only power the \nConstitution permits to be vested in federal judges is \n\"[t]he \njudicial power of the United States,\" \nArt. III, § 1, which is the power to decide, in accordance with law, who should prevail in a case or \ncontroversy, see Art. III, § 2. That power does not include \"'supervisory' authority\" over the grand \njury—\"an institution separate from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not preside.\" \nUnited States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 45-46 (1992); see also United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. \nI, 17-18 (1973) (holding that the grand jury must remain \"free to pursue its investigations \nunhindered by external influence or supervision so long as it does not trench upon the legitimate \nrights of any witness called before it.\"). To allow a court to supervise a grand jury's investigation \nwould also likely conflict with the Fifth Amendment's constitutional guarantee of \"an investigative \nbody acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.\"' Williams, 504 U.S. at 49 \n(quoting Dionisio, 410 U.S. at 16). \nThe court's judicial power also \"does not include the power to seek out law violators in \norder to punish them\" and, accordingly, it  is \"well established that the judicial power does not \ngenerally include the power to prosecute crimes.\" Young v. U.S. a rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 \nU.S. 787, 816-17 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th \nCir. 1965), and United States v.  Thompson, 251 U.S. 407, 413-17 (1920)). Rather, the Constitution \nvests the power to conduct investigations and prosecute violations of the laws in the Executive. \nSee Art. II, § 2, cl. 1; Heckler v.  Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. I, \n138 (1976). Indeed, the Second Circuit has emphasized that judicial review and regulation of \nprosecutorial decisions would place courts in the \"injudicious posture of becoming \n`superprosecutors,\"' and would invite questions about \"the judiciary's role of supervision,\" \nincluding \"[a]t what point would the prosecutor be entitled to call a halt to further investigation,\" \n\"[w]hat evidentiary standard would be used.\" Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 \nF.2d 375, 380 (2d Cir. 1973) (discussing action to require federal officials to investigate and \nprosecute persons who had allegedly violated criminal statutes). \nFor those reasons, among many, a judge's authority to initiate a proceeding and appoint an \nattorney to conduct an investigation has been circumscribed by Congress and the Supreme Court. \nOnly when a court order has been disobeyed does a court \"possess inherent authority to initiate \ncontempt proceedings.\" Young, 481 U.S. at 793. But, even in the unique context of criminal \ncontempt—which is not at issue here—a court only has authority to appoint a private lawyer to \nprosecute the contempt where the United States Attorney has refused the prosecution. See Fed. R. \nCrim. P. 42(a)(2). \nThe precedent cited by defense counsel—the special proceeding initiated by Judge Emmett \nSullivan following the dismissal of the prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens—provides no authority \nfor the exercise of the court's power here. See In re Special Proceeding, Misc. No. 09-0198 (EGS). \nIn that case, after the Department of Justice dismissed the charges against Senator Stevens for \napparent Brady violations, Judge Sullivan, pursuant to Rule 42, appointed a special \nprosecutor to \ninvestigate the violations. See United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS) (Apr. 8, 2009) (Dkt. \nNo. 375); Reporter's Transcript of Proceedings, United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS), \nEFTA00020086\n\nPage 3 \nat 46-47 (Apr. 7, 2009). But here, there is no allegation of disobedience of court order that would \ngive the court authority to initiate a proceeding under Rule 42, or appoint a private attorney. \nFinally, it bears noting that the United States Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and Department of Justice — Office of Inspector General are conducting an ongoing \nGrand Jury investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide. \nA separate investigation would likely, at best, be redundant and may risk undermining the existing \ninvestigation. \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Court grant \nGovernment's nolle prosequi motion. \nVery \ntruly yours, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nby: \n/s/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nEFTA00020087",
