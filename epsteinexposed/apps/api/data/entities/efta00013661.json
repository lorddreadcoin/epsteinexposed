Just got your messages. I could try to call you now or tomorrow we will be in \nberlin. Sorry \n  \nOri inal Message \nFrom: (USAFLS) \nTo: \nSent: Mon May 19 12:40:32 2008 \nSubject: FW: confidential communication \nFor your records. \nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz (maitto \nSent: Monda , May 19, 2008 10:54 AM \nTo: (USAFLS) \nSubject: confidential communication \nDear Alex: \nI am writing to you because I have just received the attached letter from In light of that letter, and given \nthe critical new evidence discussed below, I would like to request a meeting with you, mindful of our July 8 deadline, at \nyour earliest opportunity. Given your personal involvement in this matter to date, and the fact that at this juncture it is clear \nthat CEOS has referred the matter back to you, I respectfully request that you not shunt me off to one of your staff. You \nand I have both spent a great deal of time on this matter, and I know that we both would like to resolve this matter in a way \nthat bestows integrity both on the Department and the process. \nIn our prior discussions, you expressed that you were \"not unsympathetic\" to our various federalism concerns, but stated \nthat because you serve within the \"unitary Executive,' you believed your hands were tied by Main Justice. You were also \nextremely gracious in stating that you did not want the United States to be \"unfair\". Although CEOS limited its assessment \nto the federal statutes our had brought forth and to the application of those laws to the facts as presented, it is \nabundantly clear from letter that Main Justice is not directing this prosecution. In fact, CEOS plainly acknowledged \nthat a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would involve a 'novel application' of federal statutes and that our arguments \nagainst federal involvement are 'compelling.' Moreover, the language used by Drew in his concluding paragraph, that he \ncannot conclude that a prosecution by you in this case \"would be an abuse of discretion\" is hardly an endorsement that you \nmove forward. \nMoreover, as you know, Drew made clear that the scope of his review did not extend to the other significant issues we \nhave raised with you, such as the undo interest by some members of your staff with the financial and civil aspects of this \nmatter, or with the inappropriate discussion one member of your Office had with a senior reporter at the New York Times. \n(In fact, I have met with that reporter and have reviewed copious notes of his conversation with Mr. Weinstein). At this \nstage, we have no alternative but to raise our serious concems regarding the issues Drew refused to address with the \nDeputy or, if necessary, the Attorney General, because we believe those issues have significantly impacted the \ninvestigation and any recommendation by your staff to proceed with an indictment. That being said, it would obviously be \nmuch more constructive and efficient if we could resolve this matter directly with you in the advance of further proceedings \nin Washington. \nBecause it is clear that national policy, as determined by Main Justice, is not driving this case, the resolution of this matter \nis squarely, and solely, your responsibility. I know you want to do the right thing, and it is because you have made clear to \nEFTA00013661\n\nme on several occasions that you will always look at all of the relevant and material facts that I call the following to your \nattention. New information that has come to light strongly suggests that the facts of this case cannot possibly implicate a \nfederal prosecutorial priority. Due to established state procedures and following the initiation of multiple civil lawsuits, Mr. \nEpstein's counsel was able to take limited discovery of certain women in this matter. The sworn statements provided by \nthese women all confirm that federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case. \nThe consistent representations of witnesses such a \nand the civil complainants and their attorneys, confirm the following key points: First, there was no telephonic \ncommunication that met the requirements of § 2422(b). For example, as many other witnesses have stated, Ms. \ntestified in no unclear terms that there was never any discussion over the phone about her coming over to Mr. Epstein's \nhome to engage in sexual activity: \"The only thing that ever occurred on any of these phone calls [wi \nanother assistant] was, 'Are you willing to come over,' or, 'Would you like to come over and give a massage.'\" Tr. A \nat 15. Second, the underage women who visited Mr. Epstein have testified that they lied about their age in order to gain \nadmittance into his home and women who brought their underage friends to Mr.lpai counseled them to lie about their \nages as well. Ms. stated the following: \"I would tell my girlfriends just like approached me. Make sure you \ntell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn't know and \nI don't know if they were lying or not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18.\" Tr. at 22. Third, there was \nno routine or habit suggesting an intent to transform a massage into an illegal sexual act. For instance, Ms. stated \nthat Mr. Epstein \"never touched [her] physically\" and that all she did was \"massage( ] his back, his chest and his thighs and \nthat was it.\" Tr. at 12-13. Finally, as you are well aware, there was no force, coercion, fraud, violence, drugs, or \neven alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these women. \nThe civil suits confirm that the plaintiffs did not discuss engaging in sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving \nat Mr. Epstein's residence. This reinforces the fact that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, enticement or \ncoercion of any kind occurred. Furthermore, Mr. Herman, the attorney for most of the civil complainants, was quoted in the \nPalm Beach Post as saying that \"it doesn't matter\" that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. Epstein that they were \n18 or 19. In short, the new evidence establishing that the women deliberately lied about their age because they knew Mr. \nEpstein did not want anyone under 18 in his house directly undercuts the claim that Mr. Epstein willfully blinded himself as \nto their ages. Willful blindness is not a substitute for evidence of knowledge nor is it a negligence standard. It requires \nproof beyond reasonable doubt of deliberate intent and specific action to hide one's knowledge. There is absolutely no \nsuch evidence of that here, so it is not even a jury issue. Furthermore, willful ignorance cannot constitute the required \nmens rea for a crime of conspiracy or aiding and abetting. \nThrough the recent witness statements, we have also discovered another serious issue that implicates the integrity of the \nfederal investigation. We have learned that FBI Special Agent attempted to convince these adult women, now \nin their twenties, that they were in fact \"victims\" even though the women themselves strongly disagreed with this \ncharacterization. This conduct, once again, goes to the heart of the integrity of the investigation. In a sworn statement, \nMs. was highly critical of the overreaching by federal law enforcement officers in this case. She testified—in no \nuncertain terms—that she does not, and never did, feel like a \"victim,\" despite the fact that the FBI repeatedly tried to \nconvince her otherwise. \nI am mindful of the fact that we have a state court date of July 8 on which either to enter a plea or to commence trial. As I \nreview the trial options with Mr. Epstein, I certainly want to make sure I do everything within my power to obviate a need for \ntrial through a reasonable alternative resolution. Although it is dear that CEOS is not directing a prosecution here, and has \nstated only that you have the authority to commence such a prosecution, I am well aware that the decision whether to \nproceed, subject to any further process in Washington, is now within your discretion. I think the new facts should greatly \ninfluence your decision and accordingly, I hope you will agree to meet with me, both to discuss the new evidence and to \ndiscuss a resolution to this matter once and for all. I am available to meet with you at your earliest convenience subject to \nour mutual availability. \nRespectfully, \nJay \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
