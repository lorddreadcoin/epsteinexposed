Words you don't know can make you feel like an out-\nsider, which may \nhave the tragic consequence of keeping you from doing \nwhat you really \nwant to do when you get a massage — relax and feel better. \nYour goal may be to become one of those knowledgeable clients who enters a \nmassage clinic and requests \"a bit of cranio-sacral for this headache I've \nhad \nfor two days now, and then some Trager in the hip area to loosen my tight \npsoas, and throw in some trigger point \nwork on my traps, will your Or, on \nthe other hand, perhaps this massage mumbo-Jumbo seems completely \npointless to you, and all you really want to do is lie down and get rubbed. \nEven if you belong to the latter group, knowing at least a few of the terms that \nmassage therapists (and those who receive massage) commonly employ is \nhelpful. \nThis section is a primer on massage lingo to help familiarize you \nwith the \nterms you may run into when you \n3 Contact a massage professional to \ninquire about rates, services, and so on \n3 Visit a \nmassage clinic \n3 Read journals, magazines, or books in the field \n3 Attempt to explain massage to a \nfriend \n3 Ask people to recommend a massage \ntherapist or style for you \nTable 5-1 lists several specialized massage words and phrases that at first \nglance seem \ndeceptively like everyday words and phrases. But don't be \ndeceived. These \nwords, when used in regards to massage, are highly specific \nand, when used correctly, can lead you to hours and hours of enjoyment, \nhealth \nbenefits, and pleasure. \nTable 5-1 Massage-English, English\n-Massage Dictionary \nWord Non-manage definition Massage definition \nRolled Past-tense of \"to throw up Deep massage work on \non,\" a \nvariant spelling of \nconnective tissues that \n\"Ralphed\" realign the body with \ngravity \nBodyworker Mechanic \nspecializing in A practitioner of \nmassage \nrepairing cars after or similar \nhands-on healing \naccidents techniques \nEFTA00008120\n\n Chapter 5: A Massage Road Map 75 \nWord Non-massage definition Massage definition \nStructural work \nCarpentry, mostly done on \nhouse frames \nMassage that works on \nthe body's muscles and \nconnective tissues to \nbetter align them \nwith \ngravity \nSpa Hot tub or Jac urzi Health facility where \npeople go to learn holistic \npractices, eat healthy \nfoods, \nexercise, and \nreceive massages and spa \ntreatments \nAyurveda \nMisspelling of a famous \nbrand of natural \nbeauty \nproducts found in salons \nAn ancient healing system \nfrom India \nthat uses diet \nmeditation, herbs, and \nmassage to balance the \nbody \nSwedish \nAnything from the country \nof Sweden \nThe most well-known and \nwidely \npracticed form of \nmassage in the Western \nworld, consisting of \nstroking, kneading, apply-\ning \npressure, \nstretching, \nand so on \nTrigger point \nThe fine, pointed end of a \npistol's trigger \nA tight, tender spot in a \nmuscle that responds \nwell \nto massage \nConnective \ntissues Kleenex brand facial tissues \nall linked together in a box \nThe web of tissue \n(primarily \ncollagen fibers) \nthat \nsurrounds your every \nmuscle, organ, and bone, \nholding your body together \nDeep tissue Kleenex stuck deep between \nthe cushions on your couch \nA type of massage that \ntargets the deeper layers \nof muscle and connective \ntissue \nEnergy work Repairs on the electrical \nlines of your house \nType of \nmassage that \nfocuses on vital, invisible \nenergies in your body \n(continued) \nEFTA00008121\n\n76\n \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nTable \n5-1 (continued) \nWord Non-manage definition Massage definition \nAdhesion The sticky mark left on your \nskin after removing an \nadhesive bandage \nMuscle \nand connective \ntissue fibers that are stuck \ntogether because of \ninjuries, scars, aging, and \nlack of movement \nMassage \ncan help sepa-\nrate most adhesions, \nwhich are sometimes \npainful, though not usually \ndangerous. \nDrape \nDecorative material that \nhangs in front of a window \nTowels, sheets, and so on, \nused to cover a person \nreceiving a massage \nKnots \nThings tied \nin ropes light bands of muscle \nfibers and connective tis-\nsues that massage often \nsoftens \nOn-site massage Massage given at \nconstruction sites \nSeated and clothed \nmassage given in special \nchairs — usually in \noffices, in stores, or at spe-\ncial \nevents \nEFTA00008122\n\n• \\I \n Chapter 5: A Massage Road Map 77 \nBon jour, \nmonsieur masseuse \nYou walk \ninto a  health club and sign .up \nfor a \nmassage. A big, \nburly, bodybuilder of a  man \nwalks \nout, shakes your hand in his \nmassive paw, \nand tells you his name is \nJohn. \n\"Nice to meet \nyou,\" you say, slightly awed. \n\"How long have you•been a masseuse?\" \n\"I'm not a masseusel\" he thunders, causing you \nto \nshake in your sneakers. And once, again you \nhave that terrible realization \nthat you've flubbed \nup the whole \nmasseur/masseuse thing. \n\"Sorry,\" you \nstammer, confused and \nembar-\nrassed, but inside you're also a lithe mad. How \nare \nyou supposed to remember the difference \nbetween those silly French words, \nand who \nmade them.up in the \nfirstplace anyway? \nStrangely \nenough, it was a  Dutch man, Dr. \nJohann Mezger (1839-1909), who \ndecided to \nuse French words to describe the movements of \nmassage, and even the word \"massage\" \nitself. \nThe words for someone who performs massage \ntherefore come from the \nFrench also: \n3 A masseur is a \nmale practitioner of \nmassage. \n3 A \nmasseuse is a female practitioner. \nAn easy way for you to \nremember the correct \nterm is to think of monsieur —the French word \nfor Mr.- which sounds like masseur. And an \neven easier method is to avoid the \nmasseur/masseuse dilemma altogether by \nusing the more modem, non-gender-based term \n\"massage therapitt\" for malet and females \nalike, which.iswhat Most:professionals \nprefer, \nanyway. \nEFTA00008123\n\n78 \nPart II: The Art of \nReceiving Massage  \nEFTA00008124\n\nChapter 6 \nLook Who's \nComing to Touch \nYou \n0 0 0 0 0 • 0 • \ne OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO \nIn This \nChapter \np.

You'll \nsmile self-confidently, \ntake all your clothes off, and then ... wait a minute! \nDid I say, \"Take all your clothes off?\" \nWell, by golly, I guess I did. Suddenly, \nthis whole, wonderfully abstract concept of massage has become disconcert-\ningly real. And, in spite of your \nappreciation for the undeniably therapeutic \nbenefits of massage, if that professional stranger were to ring your \ndoorbell \nright this minute, you may be tempted to say, \"Excuse me for a \nmoment, will \nyou?

This chapter's purpose is to make you \nmore comfortable with the people who will be massaging you, including people \nyou already know, with \nwhom sharing massage will be a new adventure. \nStalking the \nElusive Referral \nOne time-honored concept used \nto battle your fear of a stranger in your \nhome is to assure that the person who shows up on \nyour doorstep to give \nyou a massage is not a stranger. You can accomplish this goal in two ways: \nEFTA00008125\n\nSO\nPart II: The \nArt of Receiving Massage  \nII\n3 Give \nyour cousin Billy several thousand \ndollars and send him through \nmassage school so you can \ncall him later and make an appointment. \n3 Get a \nreferral. \nThe second option is by far the more common choice, but that doesn't mean \nyou should entirely \ndismiss the concept of financing massage \nschool for \nfriends or family members. \nThe world needs more massage therapists! If you \nhappen to be extremely wealthy, do the world a favor and set up a massage-\nschool trust fund. (The \ninvestment may even be tax deductible.) \nA six-point \nmental checklist (to go over in your mind \nbefore deciding which \nmassage therapist to try) \nNo matter how qualified and highly recom- 3. \nmended -a massage therapist may come to you, \nandto matter what Other people say about her, \nyou still must decide whether she's the right \nmassage therapist for you. Remember, you're \nvery likely to share a .great deal.of yourself with \nthis person (massage \ntherapists are like hair \ndreSsert on steroids when it comes to the Um-\nfiding-in factor). And,-because your massage \ntherapitt widget toknow your body better than \nanyone else except an intimate partner, you \nhaveto.be willing totrust her.,Sometimes, you \nhave no precise way to gauge which massage 5. \ntherapist will make precisely the best \"lit with \nyour personality, and no amount of analytical \ndeliberation will help you decide who to choose. \nThat said, try using this quick checklistto judge \nyour own gut reaction tothaperson you're about \nto spend a considerable amount of quality the \nwith: \n1.  Does she immediately make you feel like \nyou're important? \n2.  Does she look you right in the eye and fi\nll you \nwith a  sense \nof utter confidence so that \nyou're already feeling better before she \neven touches you? \n4. \n6. \nIs she someone you Dice to emulate as far \nas calmnessand tranquility go? Likeit or not, \nyou will.probabhi look upon your massage \ntherapist as a role model in the relaxation \ncategory. A tense, uptight massage therapitt \nisn't setting a good example. \nIs, she \"soft\" where she needs to be soft \n(unobtrusive and \nnon-opinionated) and \n\"hard\" \nwhere she needs to be hard (unre-\nlenting in her serious desire to see you feel \nbetter)? \nIs she someone you feel an immediate \nsense of \nempathywith? To use a precise sci-\nentific term here, do the two of you click? \nIs she the right sex? The decision on \nwhether to receive massage from a male Or \nfemale massage therapist is entirely up to \nyou. Many people have no preference, as \nlong-as the massage therapist is competent \nand strong, but others feel more \ncomfortable \nwith one sex than the other \nin a  massage \nsetting. Most massage establishments will \ngive you a choice when requesting a mas-\nsage therapist. Afteryou get started with the \nactual massage, you'll probably find thatthe \nmassage therapist's gender doesn't really \nmatter as much as you may have thought \nEFTA00008126\n\nChapter 6: \nLook Who's Coming to Touch You S \nOf course, you may be more comfortable going to the \"neutral ground\" of a \nprofessional massage \nestablishment rather than inviting someone unknown \ninto your home. See the section \"Visiting a clinic\" later in this chapter for \nmore \ninformation. \nIn case you're wondering who to ask for a referral without embarrassing \nyourself, the following list may come in handy. Actually, you may be sur-\nprised at how many people can potentially help you find a massage therapist. \nFirst, you probably should NOT ask certain people to refer a massage thera-\npist, including . .. \n3 Certain physicians who are not aware of the benefits of massage and \nwho may think that all massage therapists are \"quacks.\" \n3 Your Aunt Gertrude who had a massage once on a cruise and now con-\nsiders herself an expert. \n3 \nPeople who are currently under Indictment for health-care fraud. \nAfter you cross \nthose sources off your list, you can still find plenty of helpful \nfolks ready to steer you towards the nearest pair of helping hands. Some of \nthose places where you're most likely to get a good referral from include \n... \n3 The contact numbers at major massage associations and accrediting \norganizations (see the section \"Organizations That Can Help You Find a \nMassage Therapist\" later in this chapter). \n3 \nEnlightened physicians who are aware of the benefits of massage and \nwho are more than happy to refer you to the ones they work with. In \nfact, many doctors these days have a massage therapist or two on staff. \n3 Athlete friends who receive massage as part of their training. \n3 A co-worker or family member who's had a particularly good experience \nwith the massage therapist she's been using for an extended period of \ntime. \n3 \nThe \"best-or articles that health and beauty magazines such as Shape, \nSelf, Mademoiselle, Glamour, and so on often feature. \n3 Your friend Tina, the one who wears the Birkenstock sandals all the time \nand has \nthat look of \nblissed-out \nsatisfaction on her face \neven when she's \nstanding in line at the grocery store checkout counter. \nEFTA00008127\n\n82 \nPart II: The Art of \nReceiving Massage  \nGetting a Helping \nHand \nYou can collectively refer to the \nfour numbers I'm about to give you as \"mas-\nsage central.\" Among them you'll find the contact information for over 80,000 \nqualified massage therapists in the U.S. right at your fingertips. \nDrum roll please ... and the contact numbers are: \n3 To find a massage therapist who is a member of the oldest nationwide \norganization, the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA), call toll \nfree, \n888-843-2682, for their Find-A-Massage•Therapist0''> Location Service. \n3 To find the nearest member of Associated Bodywork and Massage \nProfessionals (ABMP), call 800-458-2267. \n3 \nTo find a member massage therapist of the \nInternational Massage \nAssociation (IMA), call 202-387-6555. \n3 For a list of massage therapists who have taken the test given by the \nNational Certification Board for \nTherapeutic Massage and Bodywork \n(NCBTMB) and are \ntherefore Nationally Certified in all 50 U.S. states, call \n703-610-9015. \nOf course, among those 80,000. massage therapists, you're going \nto find \nquite a range of skills and offerings, and there isn't one, single \ntried-and-true \nmeans of prequalifying someone. However, you are living In an extremely \nlucky time, oh fortunate massage recipient, because in the \npast several years \nthe number of highly skilled and fully trained massage pros has grown at an \namazing rate all around the world. \nFollowing is a list of contact numbers for professional massage practitioners \nin several countries: \n3 \nAustralia: Massage Australia, Sydney, tel. (02) \n4757 3050 \n3 \nFrance: French Federation of Masseurs \nKinesitherapeutes \n(FFMKR), \nParis, tel. 01 44 83 \n46 00 \n3 Italy: Federazione \nNazionale dei Collegi dei Massofisioterapisti \n(F.N.C.M.), Rome, tel. 03 94 61 915 499 \n3 U.K.: The Institute for Complementary Medicine, London, tel. 00 44 171 \n237-5165 \nLocating a \nMassage Therapist \nIf for some reason you can't locate a massage therapist by simply calling one \nof the numbers listed previously, you can pursue several other avenues in \nquest of massage. \nEFTA00008128\n\n   Chapter 6: Look Who's Coming to Touch You 83 \nChecking the ads \nEach locale has its own regulations regarding the advertising of massage, and \nsometimes the regulations vary from city to city. What may be perfectly legal \nin Los Angeles, for example, can be verboten in Slow( City, Iowa. \nBeware those ads featuring massage therapists with huge muscles, wearing \nblack leather vests with no shirt underneath, staring straight into the camera \nwith a \ncome\n-hither look \nin their eyes, especially in San \nFrancisco. These \npictures may be a clue tipping you off to the extra curricular intentions of \nthis particular massage therapist, licensed or not. Then again, it could \nbe a \nfashion statement. \nLetting your fingers do \nthe walking \nVIN/0\n4, \nIn some areas, massage therapists must include an official massage license \nnumber as part of any Yellow Pages listing for massage. According to Dan \nUlrich, past president of the Florida State Massage Therapy Association, the \ninclusion of the license number in Yellow Pages and other ads significantly \nreduced the amount of unethical massage advertising. Although the license \nnumber is not mandatory \neverywhere, it's a clue that you're dealing with a \ntherapeutic professional. If you don't see a license number or some other \nprofessional credentials listed, call and ask for one. \nOpening the bureau door \nYou may occasionally run into ads for massage service bureaus that guaran-\ntee you a massage within a specified period of time (usually within a couple \nhours). The bureaus have a central number that you call, and they send one \nof the many independent massage therapists on their list out to you at your \nchoice of location. Quite often, these are very up-and-up enterprises run by \nentrepreneurial massage therapists who have discovered a new way to multi-\nply their effectiveness and their income. At times, though, the quality of the \nservices offered can be a little iffy, because all the massage therapists aren't \ncarefully screened all the time in all the bureaus. So, if you're not personally \nfamiliar with the service, and you haven't received a specific recommenda-\ntion, you're never sure exactly what you're going to get when you call one of \nthese places. Bureaus are most useful when you're traveling and have no \nother means of contacting a massage therapist. \nEFTA00008129\n\n54\n Part II: The Art of \nReceiving Massage  \nGetting the most massage \nfor your money \nWhen dealing with your massage \ntherapist, cer-\ntain \ntactics cad \nincrease \nhappiness \nfor both of \nyou, and in the \nprocess, maximize the value you \nreceive \nfrom \nyour experience. \n3 Offer to pay up front for a discounted series \nof massages: For example, if the massage \ntherapist charges $50 for a massage, offer \n$400 \ndollars for 10 massages. Often, mas-\nsagetherapists appreciate the immediate \ncash flow and the guarantee of ongoing \nbusiness. This \narrangement is good for their \nbusiness, and good for your pocketbook. \n3 Ask for a massage in exchange for refer-\nring a new \nclient to your massage \ntherapist She will appreciate the new \ncus-\ntomer, and you deserve the recognition. \n3 \nInquire about rates for longer massage ses-\nsions: Often the price drops proportionally \nwith the length of \nthe massage, and you can \nreceive a  90- minute massage for not too \nmuch morethan a 60- minute massage. A \nmassage therapist \nwho charges $50 for an \nhour massage may offer an hour \nand a half \nmassage for $65 or $70, for example. \nGoing back to school \nWherever \nyou are, \none \nexcellent way to get in touch with \na \nmassage practitioner \nis to call a massage school in your area. There are more schools around than \nyou think — the U.S. alone has \nover 800. Look in the phone book, under \"voca-\ntional schools\" or \"schools, massage therapy.\" The \nschools often have a list of \ngraduates in the area that they can recommend, and quite often they offer mas-\nsage services in a clinic in the school. \nOne excellent deal that many people take advantage of is known as the student \nmassage clinic In this setup, the \nstudents receive part of their training by \nworking on real massage customers, under supervision, of course. Student \nmassages \ngo for only fraction of the normal cost, usually only k to 35 the going \nrate of a professional massage in the area. More often than not, the students \nare already quite good at what they do, and dollar for dollar this option is one \nof the \nbest bargains in massage. \nKeep in mind that you may be asked to fill out a detailed feedback form after \nthe \nmassage, for training purposes. Also, the student clinics usually take \nplace in a big room with curtains separating the massage tables. Quite often, \nan instructor \nstops in to observe the student In action. So if you're a super-\nprivate individual who doesn't like to have other \npeople around when you're \ngetting a massage, the student clinic is probably not for you. Also, if  you have \na specific health problem that you'd like to address with massage, it's best to \nvisit a licensed professional. For relaxation and stress relief, though, student \nmassages are usually as effective as more expensive professional massages \nbecause the students are trying extra hard to please you (and pass their \ncoursework at the same time). \nEFTA00008130\n\n Chapter 6: Look \nWho's Coming to Touch You 55 \nPampering \npour \nMassage Therapist \nAfter you choose a massage therapist and \nbegin to develop a working rela-\ntionship with him, a \nfew endearing personality quirks \nmay begin to surface. \nSome massage therapists work \nbarefoot, even in the winter, for example. \nOthers hold a giant quartz crystal over your body before the massage. And \nsome tape a bunch of magnets under \ntheir massage table to \"align your \nenergy\" while they work on you. Try \nnot to take your massage therapist's \nidiosyncrasies too seriously. They're Just trying to do the best job they can. \nIt's just that some of their \nmethods may seem a little, um, colorful at first. \nRefer to rule # 9, \"You're the boss,\" in \nChapter 7 for advice on letting your \nmassage therapist know \nwhat you're comfortable and what \nyou're not \ncomfortable with. \nAs a general \nrule, massage therapists are a finicky \nand extremely sensitive \nlot. They're somewhat like pure-bred cats, \nand although their job description \ncalls for a great deal of touching, they also need to receive strokes them-\nselves (often to that most \ndelicate muscle, the ego). If you become an expert \nat scratching \nbehind the ears of your massage \ntherapist's self-image, you can \ncoax a better performance from him, and your \nrelationship will be a happier \none all around. \nThe following are some simple \npoints to remember whenever you're \ndealing \ndirectly with your massage therapist: \n3 Always offer \nencouragement first before you \ncriticize: For example, if \nyour massage therapist is applying a \nlittle too much pressure in a partic-\nular \narea, definitely let her know about it, but first say something like, \n\"What you were doing a \nminute ago felt really great. You can lighten up \nthe pressure \na little right now, though.\" \n3 \nAlways, \nalways, always praise the massage \nyour therapist just gave you \nimmediately after you receive it, even \nif this is the seven hundred and \neighty-ninth massage you've received from her: The immediate gratifi-\ncation of this simple act is \npowerful. It's the same reason all an actress's \nfriends rush backstage after the play to heartily laud her \nskills. The ego \nmuscle is most delicate \ndirectly after the big performance, and \nfor a great \nmassage therapist, every massage Is a type of performance. \n3 \nAlways communicate clearly about exactly what fee you \nexpect to pay \nfor exactly which \nservices: Pricing of massage services may be a sensitive \nissue. Be \nclear on the answers to the \nfollowing questions before you begin: \n• Is the \ncharge for an hour and fifteen minute massage higher than \nthat for an hour \nmassage? \n• Does the massage therapist have a cancellation policy? \n• Does your massage therapist reimburse insurance claims? \nEFTA00008131\n\n56 \nPart \nII: \nThe Art of \nReceiving \nMassage \nLicensing Touch \nBeing a wise \nconsumer, when you \nhead out looking for a \nmassage pro to rub \nyou the right way, \nyou'll want to ask \nyourself that all-important \nquestion: Is \nshe licensed? The problem \nhere is that not all good, \nprofessional massage \ntherapists \nin all areas are licensed. In the \nU.S., only half the states even \nrequire \nlicensing for massage. Some states require \nno license at all, and in \nothers the licensing is county\n-by-county or city-by-city. So \neven someone who \nis very highly \ntrained and takes her job very \nseriously may be license-less, \nthrough no fault of her own. \nInternationally, licensing \nrules for massage therapists \nvary widely from coun-\ntry to country. Some \ncountries, like Singapore, for example, have \nlittle or no \nregulation, while in other countries, like \nFrance, massage therapists are part \nof the medical \ncommunity and operate out of their \nown medical clinics. The \nbest course of action in foreign \ncountries is to ask someone you trust to \nrec-\nommend massage. Also, you can read \nthrough Chapter 17 for some more \nsuggestions. \nThe rules \nconcerning massage licensing are too \ncomplex and changeable to \nlist here. They differ from area \nto area and time to time. In \nfact, in Santa \nMonica, \nCalifornia, where I first started \nworking as a massage therapist, the \nactual laws on the \nbooks stated that nobody could open a \nmassage clinic \nwithin 500 feet of a church, \nand in order to receive your \ncity license to prac-\ntice, you had to \ntake a test certifying that \nyou were free of all \nvenereal \ndiseases. Go \nfigure. \nIf you \nwant information about how \nmassage practitioners are licensed in \nyour \narea, you can call \nthe board or department in your state that \nregulates mas-\nsage therapists. If there is no such \nregulating board, check with a local \nmassage school to see \nwhat kind of education and \ncertification is normal for \npractitioners in your \narea. \nThe best thing to do \nwhen you're trying to determine \nthe professional status \nof any individual massage \ntherapist is to ask the therapist. I know, this strat-\negy is stunningly simple, but it works. If she doesn't \nknow anything about \nlicensing, you may \nhave an unprofessional person on your hands. \nOn the \nother \nhand, if she knows her stuff, she can tell you exactly who to call or \nwhere to look to verify local licensing requirements in general, and \nhers in \nparticular. \nBecause \nthis whole licensing issue is so confusing in many areas, you're wise \nto consider certification as an equally, if not more, important factor \nin deter-\nmining who to choose as your massage \ntherapist. \nEFTA00008132\n\n Chapter 6: Look Who's Coming to Touch You 13 7 \nOriginal sin? \nSome massage therapists think that requiring \nlicensing for massage is almost sinful, because \nthey perceive what they do as art. They figure \nthat licensing massage is like licensing a painter \nto paint, or a writer to write. Ridiculous! These \npeople thoroughly oppose ahy attempts at \ncontrol or regulation. They often live in cabins in \nrugged-individualist states such as Vermont, \nwhich, as an \ninteresting side-note that has \nabsolutely nothing to do with massage, is the \nonly state that has managed to keep out \nWal-Mart stores. \nIf a massage therapist has graduated from a bona-fide massage school, he has \nreceived a certificate of completion, and this certificate often notes the \nnumber of hours completed, specialties studied, and other relevant informa-\ntion. This certification may be the single most substantial \npiece of evidence \nof a massage therapist's dedication to his craft, especially \nin those areas \nwhere licensing is not required. \nAnother type of certification is awarded to those massage \ntherapists who \ncomplete a test given by a certification board, \nsuch as the National \nCertification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB). This \ncertification is \nanother way of determining competency. \nRemember, in massage, just as in a marriage, It's not the actual piece of \npaper, but the level of commitment on the participants' part that is most vital \nto the success of the \nrelationship. A fancy, gold-embossed massage license \nhanging on the wall in a \nframe is no guarantee that you're going to like a \ngiven massage therapist's technique. And, on the other hand, someone with \nno certificate or license at all may be one of the most highly sldlled massage \ntherapists you'll ever meet. \nWhen it comes down \nto \nchoosing a pro, go \nwith \nyour heart and your intuition. \nEFTA00008133\n\n58 \nPart \nII: \nThe \nArt \nof \nReceiving \nMassage \nEFTA00008134\n\nChapter 7 \nThe Rules for Receiving Massage \nin This \nChapter \n0. Following guidelines for receiving a massage \nD \nGetting in tune and staying In touch \nFa\nom the day you were born, your body has been hanging around you like \nshadow. It never leaves you alone. You wake up in the morning, and \nthere your body is, faithful as a puppy, \nthumping its little tail against your \nfreshly washed bedspread. At first, having a body Is a novelty, a fact that you \ncan see reflected in the faces of babies and small children. Even the most \nmundane details about their bodies fill them with delight. \"Oh boy, there's my \nhand again!\" \nAs you \nmature, \nhowever, you become more \naccustomed to having a \nbody, \nand it begins to bore you. This boredom usually occurs as young people \nenter their teenage years. \"Oh boy, my hand again, big deal.\" At this point, \nthey begin to pierce their bodies in various locations and cover them with \ndecorative tattoos. By the time people are full-fledged adults, though, most of \nthem have begun to concentrate on other things, leaving their bodies far \nbehind. The only time they really get connected to their bodies is when \nthey're learning a new skill of some kind, like soccer, or neurosurgery. \nThe \nresult? Most people take their bodies for granted. One of massage's main \nobjectives is to get you back \"into\" your body again. A good massage should \nrekindle your childlike \nenthusiasm for life. \nIn order for massage to help you achieve the lofty goal of getting back in \ntouch with yourself, you need to follow certain guidelines, which I Just \nhappen to outline in this chapter. At first, some of these \"rules\" may seem a \nlittle simplistic to you. Others may appear irrelevant. However, I give you my \npersonal guarantee that if you try them out when you're on the receiving end \nof a massage, you're going to get much more out of the experience. \nSo, approach these guidelines with an open mind, apply them when you feel \nthat doing so is appropriate during \nyour own massage exchanges, and watch \nyour enjoyment of massage soar to levels beyond your expectations. \nEFTA00008135\n\n9\n0 \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nThe rules for receiving massage are, in fact, quite similar to the Ancient \nSecrets of Life as passed down by Big Important Spiritual Leaders for thou-\nsands of years. Yes, it's true; you can learn every really important thing in life \nby lying down and \ngetting rubbed. \nHoning your skills at receiving massage is more than simply a way to feel \nbetter. \nIt's also a way to improve your life. Read \nthrough these rules, practice \nthem, and you'll \nsee what I mean. \nRule #1: Keep \nBreathing \nWhen you receive a massage from a \nprofessional, she may remind you sev-\neral times in a soft, soothing voice to \nbreathe. And you may be tempted to \nsay right back to her in a not-so-soothing voice, \"I'm already \nbreathing, in \ncase you haven't noticed.\" \nDon't be offended. The massage \ntherapist's comments aren't meant to imply \nthat she thinks you're deceased, and she's not trying to insult you for your \npoor breathing skills. In fact, \nmany massage therapists start each and every \nmassage \nwith a series of deep breaths, regardless of how \nobviously alive you \nare to begin with. \nA massage therapist may tell you to take \ndeep breaths during a massage for \nthe following reasons: \n3 To help you focus on \nthe sensations you're feeling in your body rather \nthan the \ninternal monologue going on in your mind \n3 \nTo get you to fill your lungs and thus all your cells with \nfresh oxygen, \nenlivening your entire body \n3 To help you become aware of muscles that \nyou've been holding tense so \nyou can start to relax them \nMost people \nwalk around not actually breathing \nmuch. People tend to use \nonly a tiny percentage of their lung capacity, \njust like they use only a tiny per-\ncentage of their brain \ncapacity. Proper breathing changes that. \nWhile receiving a massage, focus \nyour mind as fully as possible upon the \nvery \nimportant act of breathing. Focusing your mind on \nyour breath brings \nyour awareness back to \nyour body quicker than anything else. \nEFTA00008136\n\n Chapter \n7: The Rules for \nReceiving Massage \n91 \nGoing \nwith the \ndiaphragm's flow \nThe diaphragm is a muscle in your \nabdomen — it looks like a soft pizza \nshaped into a \ndouble-headed dome — that is responsible \nfor keeping you \nbreathing (see Figure 7-1). Most of the \ntime, your diaphragm is contracting \nand relaxing without conscious \nthought from you, but you can teach \nyourself \nto control this \nactivity. In the section \"Exercising \nyour breathing muscle's \nbreath,\" I give you an \nexercise that helps you use this muscle more \ncon-\nsciously, which enables you to exert more \ncontrol over your breathing, \nmaking It fuller and deeper. \nFigure 7-1: \nThe \ndiaphram \nand other \nelements \nof your \nrespiratory \nsystem. \nEFTA00008137\n\n92 Part II: The \nArt of Receiving Massage  \nExercising your breathing muscles \nThe next time you have the chance, spend a few minutes observing \na sleep-\ning — or at least relaxed — infant or toddler \nbreathe. Pay close attention to \nthe abdomen, and you can see the entire area gently lift and lower. This \nmovement is the result of an active, uninhibited \ndiaphragm at work. \nThen look down at your own abdomen while you breathe for a few minutes. \nNotice a difference? Where did all the \nlifting and lowering go? You still have \nthe same breathing mechanisms \nyou always did; they're not something you \ngrow out of. With each breath you take, you should indeed have a visibly \nrhythmical, moving \nbody. Somewhere along the line, though, most people \nstifle \nthemselves into taking shallow, insufficient breaths. \nThis type of breath-\ning is a common reaction to the act of growing older. \nDon't worry, you're still \ngetting enough \noxygen to survive. But, are you getting enough to thrive? By \npracticing \ndeep breathing during massage, you \ncan literally rejuvenate your \nbody, sending extra-oxygenated blood \nout all the way to your toes. \nThe key to \nbreathing properly while getting a \nmassage is to take whole \nbreaths, a term that basically \nmeans \"breathing like a kid.\" \nGo ahead and try a \nwhole breath \nnow. Lie down on your back, placing \nyour palms gently on your \nabdomen, \nand then begin this \nfour-step process: \n1. \nBreathe deep and low into your lungs so \nthat your abdomen pushes \nyour hands upward. \nMake sure that \nyou're not Just pushing up with your stomach muscles, \nbut that you're \nactually expanding the entire \nabdominal area. \n2. Continue the \nexpansion up into your ribs, \nallowing them to push out-\nward toward each side. \n3. When your ribs have expanded out as \nfar as they'll go, then expand \nthem up toward \nyour head, taking the last bit of breath into the \narea \njust \nbeneath your collar bones. \n4. Let \nthe whole thing \ncollapse. \nYou don't need to try and \npush the air out; Just let it flow. When \nyour \nlungs feel \nempty and your abdomen is flat \nonce again, you can restart \nthe \nprocess. \nRule #2: Stay \nLoose \nAs you probably \nknow, one of the main points \nof getting a massage is to \nrelax. \nLogically, you may then think \nthat you can just give your \nbody to a massage \ntherapist who will relax \nyour body for you, like giving \nyour car to a mechanic \nand expecting him \nto fix it. \nEFTA00008138\n\nChapter 7: The \nRules for Receiving \nMassage 93 \nPlease release me, let me go ... \nAfteryou receive several massages, you'll grad-\nually become accustomed to relaxing your own \nmuscles. Eventually you notice that you \ncan \ndo \nthe same thing even when you're not receiving \nmassage, like \nwhen you're waiting in line at the \ngrocery store, stuck in traffic, or sitting in  a \nmeeting with your boss. \n\"Twang,\" will go one of \nyour muscle fibers, \nand you'll feel it \nbeginning \nto tighten \nup. Then, silently, \nwithout anyone \nnoticing, you send a \nmental message to the \ngrowing \nknot, telling it to go \naway, in the same \nway that your \nmassage therapist helps \nyou do \nduring a \nmassage. You can \ntake this side bene-\nfit of massage \nwith you wherever you go. \nExpecting a massage \ntherapist to do all your body's \nrelaxing is called giving \nup \nresponsibility for your own \nrelaxation, and it's a no-no. Staying loose \nis your \nresponsibility; \nthe massage therapist can help you, \nbut you basically have to \ndo the relaxing yourself. So how do you do that? \nYou accomplish relaxation \nby becoming more aware \nof what you're feeling in \nyour own body. During the massage, \nyour massage therapist often \nreminds \nyou to focus on \"knots\" or \ntight areas. In those \nmoments, using the power of \nyour \nown imagination, you can begin to \nvisualize what those knots may look \nlike in your muscles, and \nto let go of them. \nIf you're not staying loose \nby engaging your mind to \nrelax your own muscles, \nyou're missing more than half the \nbenefits and effects of the massage. \nRule #3: Let Go \nWhen you receive a massage, \nespecially the first time, \nyou may have a ten-\ndency — like \njust about everyone else in the \nworld — to \"help\" the \nperson \nworking on you. You may \ngraciously lift your limbs, hold \nyour head up, and \ntwist your body around, all to make things \neasier for the other person. \nAlthough this \"helping\" may \nseem like the friendliest thing \nto do, you're actu-\nally \nhindering the massage process and \nmaking your massage therapist's job \na little more difficult. \nRelaxing a person who is holding \nher own arm up in the \nair as stiff as a flag pole Is pretty darn hard. \nThe \ntechnical term for this tendency during \nmassage is hanging on, and you \nwant to do exactly \nthe opposite, which is letting.go. But what, exactly, \ndogs \n\"letting go\" mean? \nEFTA00008139\n\n94 Part II: \nThe Art of Receiving Massage  \nThe limp-arm \nexperiment \nYou're basically hanging \nonto yourself for dear \nlife, even the parts of your body that are painful, \nstiff, or tense. Th\nis•hanging \non is a.naturalten-\ndency, butto get \nthe most out of a massage, you \nhaveto let go. The limp-arm experiment\" is an \neasy way to begin training yourself to letgo. \nAil \nyou need.is-a partner \nand someplace comfort-\nable to lie \ndown. \n1. Lie \ndown on your back and have your part-\nner lift your arm up in the air several \ninches. \n2. After a few seconds, have your partner let \n. \ngo of your arm without any warning to you. \nlet \nyour arm drop back down. \n(Make-sure \nthat-you're lying on a-soft-surface.) \n3. Watch to see whether your amt plops back \ndown, limp as a  noodle, or \nwhether you \nhold. it right where she left it, stiff as a \nboard. \nWhat do you have to do to let your arm drop \nback down? What thought process do you \nhave to go through? What mental image? \nWhat body sensation? \n4.  Tell your partner to lift your arm a  little \nhigher \neach time. \nInstead of dropping your arm all the way \nback down, tell her to \ncatch it in her other \nhand. \n5.  Keep repeating this exercise until your arm \ncompletely lets go end your partner can \ndrop.it from any height with \nabsolutely no \nresistance. \nThis.ability may come naturally to you the \nvery first time you try to let go, but normally \n• \nthe exercise takes-quite a bit of conscious \neffort. You Maynot be able to let go until you \nniake several Separate attempts on differ-\nent days. After you master one arm, you can \ntry the other arm, a leg, or \nyour head. \nUse this newly formed'skill to let go \nthe next time \nyou receive-a \nmassage. \nIf you were to take a microscope and look deep within your muscles and \njoints while \nyou're getting a massage, you'd discover some specialized nerve \ncells that monitor the position and relative movement of your body. These \ncells are called proprioceptors (see Chapter 4). \nThese cells constantly tell you where you are in space, something everybody \nlikes to have a pretty firm control over all of the time, even while asleep. \nThese cells keep you from just rolling right out of- bed every night. \nAbout the only \ntime you completely \nlet go of all \nyour holding \npatterns, ten-\nsions, and proprioceptive rigidities is when you're under deep anesthesia. \nUnder anesthesia, people sometimes release the tension they normally think \nof as \"built-in\" through age or heredity, including stooped shoulders, stiff \nhips, ugly grimaces, and more. When they come \nout of anesthesia, they \nreclaim these habitual patterns almost instantaneously. They can't sustain \nthe relaxation because it's unconscious. Massage, conversely, allows people \nto achieve a conscious \nrelaxation, which can last Indefinitely. \nEFTA00008140\n\n \nChapter \n7: \nThe \nRules \nfor \nReceiving \nMassage \n95 \nOne \nof \nmy \nclients \nsuffered \nfor \nyears \nfrom \ndebilitating \npain \ndue \nto \nwhiplash. \nThen \none \nday \nshe \nreceived \na \nmassage \nfrom \na \nwoman \nat \nGurney's \nInn, \na \nspa \nin \nMontauk, \nNew \nYork. \nAfter \nthat \nmassage, \nthe \npain \nwas \nalmost \nentirely \ngone, \nand \nit \ncontinued \nto \ngradually \nfade \naway. \nMy \nclient \nwas \nable \nto \nmake \nsuch \na \ndrastic \nchange \nby \nletting \nherself \ngo \nfully \ninto \nthe \nhealing \nhands \nof \nthe \nmas-\nsage \ntherapist. \nWhen \nshe \ndid, \nshe \nstopped \nholding \nonto \nthe \nsame \npainful, \nhabitual \npatterns \nthat \nhad \nformed \nin \nher \nbody \nsince \nthe \naccident. \nRule \n#4: \nStop \nThinking, \nStart \nBeing \nThe \nproblem \nwith \nyour \nmind \nis \nthat \nit \njust \nworks \ntoo \ndarn \nwell, \nthinking \nand \nthinking \nand \nthinking \nwithout \nstopping \nall \nday \nlong \nfrom \nthe \nfirst \nmoment \nyou \nwake \nup \nuntil \nwell \nafter \nyour \nhead \nhits \nthe \npillow. \nThis \nfeature \nis \nfine \nduring \nmost \nof \nyour \ndaily \nactivities, \nbut \nwhen \nIt \ncomes \nto \ngetting \na \nmassage, \ntoo \nmuch \nthinking \nis \ndefinitelya \ndrawback. \nMany \npeople \nget \na \nmassage \nand \nthen \nten \nminutes \nlater \ncan \nbarely \nremember \nit \nbecause \nthey \nweren't \nreally \npaying \nattention \nto \nit \nwhile \nit \nwas \nhappening. \nInstead, \nan \nongoing \nstream \nof \nthoughts \nkept \nthem \nfrom \nfully \nexperiencing \nthe \nmassage. \nWhen \nyou're \ngetting \na \nmassage, \ndon't \nthink \nabout \nwhat \nyou \nshould \nhave \ndone \nthe \nday \nbefore \nor \nwhat \nyou \nplan \nto \ndo \nan \nhour \nlater. \nA \nmassage \nis \ntime \nto \nBe \nHere \nNow. \nThe \nsensations \nyou're \nfeeling \noffer \na \ngreat \nopportunity \nto \nquiet \nyour \nmind, \nfocus, \nand \nthink \nof \nnothing \nelse \nfor \na \nlittle \nwhile. \nIn \nthis \nway, \nevery \nmassage \nis \na \npotential \nmeditation. \nDon't \nget \nme \nwrong: \nrelaxing \nand \njoking \naround \nduring \na \nmassage \nis \nperfectly \nokay, \ntoo, \nbut \nmost \npeople, \nat \nleast \nonce \nin \na \nwhile, \ncan \nbenefit \nfrom \na \nmassage \nmeditation. \n(See \nthe \nsidebar, \n\"A \nmassage \nmeditation,\" \nlater \nin \nthis \nchapter.) \nRate \n#5: \nNo \nPain, \nNo \nGain? \nNo \nWay! \nYou \nmay \nhave \nheard \nof \nthe \nmassage\n-masochists \nwho \ndon't \nbelieve \nthey're \nreceiving \na \nreal \nmassage \nunless \nthey \nhave \nto \ngrit \ntheir \nteeth \nto \nkeep \nfrom \nscreaming \nthrough \nthe \nwhole \nthing. \nThey're \nthe \nones \nyou \ncan \nhear \nyelling \nfrom \nbehind \nmassage \nroom \ndoors, \n\"More \npressure! \nMore \npressure!\" \nThis \ngreen\n-beret \nschool \nof \nmassage \nis \nan \nunfortunate \nresult \nof \nthe \n\"no\n-pain, \nno\n-gain\" \nmentality \nthat \nmilitary \nacademies, \nfull\n-contact \nsports \nenthusiasts, \nand \ncertain \ndaytime\n-television \ntalk \nshow \nhosts \nfoster. \nYou \ndon't \nneed \nto \nbuy \ninto \nthis \nway \nof \nthinking, \nand \nyou \nshouldn't \nlet \nthis \nattitude \nscare \nyou \naway \nfrom \ngetting \na \nmassage. \nEFTA00008141\n\n96\n \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nA massage meditation \nMeditation, in a nutshell, is the act of focusing 4. \nyour entire attention on just one thing,thus stop-\nping the constant chatter inside your head and \nexperiencing a state of timelessness, content-\nment, and wholeness. People achieve this state \nin many ways — through sports, or silence, or \nprayer, for example — \nand massage is yet \nanother activity that you can use to effectively \nshut out the rest of the world and tune into your 5. \nown inner peace. The next time you receive a \nmassage, try this \nmeditation ... \n1. Close your eyes and begin to get in touch \nwith.your breath, as I describe in the sec-\ntion \"Rule \nRI: Keep Breathing.\" \nBefore you receive the first touch of the \nmassage, spend several minutes trying to \nclear your mind of any other thoughts. \nConcentrateonly on your breathing. \n2. When your manage therapist first makes \ncontact, imagine yourself breathing \nin \nthrough that very spot \nFor example, if she starts by massaging your \nneck, imagine a stream of fresh oxygen and \nenergy entering through your \nneck, exactly \nwhere her fingers are. \n3. On the exhalation, imagine your muscles in \nthat same area becoming softer, warmer, \nand looser. \nContinue with this \nawareness — breathing \nrelaxation into each successive point that \nthe massage therapist is \ntouching. \nEventually, you become aware that the mas-\nsage therapist is tuning in to your breath as \nwell, and the massage becomes a shared \nmeditation. \nCommunicate with your massage therapist \nboth verbally and nonverbally. Together, \nyou-can create a special massage mood \nthat will help you focus on your experi-\nence, making the \nmassage more like a \nmeditation (see Chapter 9). \n6. Keep bringing your mind back to the \nmassage. \nYou may realize, at various points during the \nmassage, that your mind has wandered off \non tome train of thought. This is completely \nnatural and happens even to \nadvanced \nmeditation practitioners. Simplytring your \nmind gently back to the breath and the \nrelaxation. Don't worry about how \"good\" \nyou-are at meditation. See Meditation For \nDummies (IDG Books Worldwide) for more \nguidance and tips about meditation. \nSo, how much pain should you experience during a massage? In my opinion, \nnone. Zero. However, the line is indeed thin between the pleasure you receive \nduring massage and a certain kind of therapeutic pain. Some people like to \nwalk that line while they're getting a massage. If you want to experiment walk-\ning this line yourself, make sure to do so with an experienced \nprofessional. \nAlthough certain muscle knots and patterns of tension do respond well to \nfirm, well-focused pressure, you don't necessarily need to experience it for \nyourself. Harder massage is not always better \nmassage, and at times the light-\nest touch can achieve the most \nprofound benefits. \nEFTA00008142\n\n \nChapter \n7: \nThe \nRules \nfor \nReceiving \nMassage \n97 \nRule \n#6: \nListen \nto \npour \nEmotions \nDon't \nbe \nsurprised \nif \nduring \na \nmassage \none \nday \nyou \nsuddenly, \nfor \nno \nreason \nat \nall, \nfeel \nlike \ncrying \nyour \neyes \nout, \nor \nlaughing \nhysterically. \nMassage \nsome-\ntimes \nhas \nthat \neffect \non \npeople. \nSome \nof \nthe \nreasons \nfor \nthis \nemotional \nresponse \ninclude: \n3 \nCertain \nemotional \nmemories \n— \nusually \nthe \nresult \nof \npowerful \nexperi-\nences \n— \ncan \nresurface \nwhen \nyour \nbody \nis \nmassaged. \n3 \nNo \none \nhas \ntouched \nyou \nwith \ncare, \ncompassion, \nand \ngentleness \nfor \na \nvery \nlong \ntime. \nIn \nthat \ncase, \nthe \nexperience \nsuddenly \noverwhelms \nyou \nwith \ngratitude, \nbringing \nforth \ntears. \n3 \nYou're \na \nvery \nticklish \nperson. \nAs \nesoteric \nas \nthe \nfirst \ntwo \nexplanations \nmay \nsound, \nthey're \nentirely \nplausi-\nble. \nIn \nfact, \ncertain \ntypes \nof \nmassage \nare \nfamous \nfor \nstirring \nup \nemotions. \nRolling, \nfor \ninstance, \noften \ntriggers \nthis \ntype \nof \nexperience. \nThe \nexplanation \nfor \nthis \nemotional \ncomponent \nof \nmassage \nis \nstraightforward \n— \nyour \nbody \nand \nmind \nhave \nfaithfully \nrecorded \nyour \nevery \nexperience, \nbut \nsome \nof \nthese \nexperiences \nwere \nso \nunpleasant \nthat \nyou \nfiled \nthem \naway \nIn \nyour \nuncon-\nscious \nand \nshut \ndown \ncertain \nfeelings \nin \nthe \ncorresponding \npart \nof \nyour \nbody. \nMassaging \nthe \naffected \nareas \ncan \nbring \nyour \nawareness \nback \nto \nyour \nbody, \nthus \nunlocking \nthe \nmemories. \nIf  \nyou \nencounter \none \nof \nthese \nemotional \npeaks \nyourself \nduring \na \nmassage, \nrelax, \nbreathe, \nand \nallow \nit \nto \nhappen. \nRemembering \nthat \nyou \nare \nsafe \nin \nyour \npresent \nenvironment, \nlet \nyour \nmind \ndrift \nto \nwhatever \nimages \nor \nmemories \nseem \nto \nbe \nsurfacing. \nYou \nmay \nfind \nyourself \nremembering \nall \nsorts \nof \nthings \nthat \nyou \nhadn't \nthought \nof \nfor \nyears, \nand \nyou \ncan \nbenefit \nfrom \nletting \nthe \nattendant \nemotions \nflow \nfreely \nthrough \nyour \nbody, \nwithout \ntrying \nto \nstifle \nthem. \nProfessional \nmassage \ntherapists \nare \naccustomed \nto \nthis \ntype \nof \nemo-\ntional \nrelease \nand \nknow \nhow \nto \nmake \nyou \nfeel \ncomfortable \nwhile \nit's \nhappening. \nThere's \nno \nneed \nto \nfeel \nembarrassed \nby \nthe \nexperience. \nif, \nas \noccasionally \nhappens, \none \nof \nthese \nresurfacing \nmemories \nis \nparticularly \ntraumatic, \nas \nin \nthe \ncase \nof \nabuse, \ndo \nwhatever \nis \nnecessary \nto \ncomfort \nyour-\nself. \nCommunicate \nwith \nthe \nperson \nmassaging \nyou, \nletting \nher \nknow \nthat \nyou \nneed \nto \nsit \nup \nagain, \nor \nget \nwrapped \nin \na \nblanket \nfor \na \nfeeling \nof \nsafety. \nHave \nsome \ntissues \nnearby \nto \ndry \naway \ntears. \nLater \nyou \ncan \ndecide \nwhether \nyou \nwant \nto \npursue \nthese \nmemories \nfurther \nwith \nthe \nguidance \nof \na \npsychologist \nor \nother \ncounselor. \nEFTA00008143\n\n95\n  Part II: The Art of \nReceiving Massage  \nRute #7: \nI3tissing \nOut Is Okay \nSometimes, massage doesn't \nJust \nmake you feel \ngreat; it \nmakes you feel \necsta-\ntic, rapturous, and filled with bliss. The feeling is visceral. You're lying there \none minute relaxing, hopefully concentrating on your breathing, but perhaps \njust going over your \ngrocery \nlist \nin your head, when \nKABOOM!, it hits you, \nand suddenly you're \njust floating there in a syrupy sea of endorphins, not \nknowing what to do with yourself. \nI can \ntell you \nwhat to do: enjoy \nthis \nfeeling while it lasts, \nbecause, like every \nother \nhuman experience, it passes. \nThese experiences are different for everyone, and nobody knows exactly \nwhat causes them. They've been responsible for many people changing their \nentire lives and heading into a career as a massage therapist. And people \nwith spiritual inclinations, once touched in this fashion, have created entire \nministries devoted to the \"laying on of hands.\" \nA minister named Zach Thomas from North Carolina once had such a power-\nful experience receiving a massage that he went on to \nbecome a massage \ntherapist himself. At first, his church was \nopposed to his hands-on work, and \nZach had to practice massage privately. Eventually, though, he took his skills \nand his compassionate touch out to the public, performing massage for dying \npeople in hospices and hospitals. He helped form a group called the National \nAssociation of Bodywork in Religious Services (NABRS), which is active \ntoday with hundreds of members. Much of the work the members of this \nassociation do is for those \npeople who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford \nit. The nuns and \npriests and other clergy involved practice the actual \"laying \non of hands\" as written about in the Bible. For more information, you can \nwrite to the organization at 337 \nTranquil Avenue, Charlotte, NC 28209. \nThe spiritual secret behind massage? Simpleahat massage really boils down \nto is two people just being together fully in the present moment, which has \nbeen the essence of \nspiritual traditions forever, especially in the East. The \nmystical \ntraditions of the West have expressed similar sentiments, as noted \nin the phrase, \"Be still and know that I am God.\" These understandings are \nmystical in nature, not reserved for any one particular religion. \nThink of it this way— massage \nis \none \nsure-fire way to follow the Golden Rule \nthat exists in almost all cultures and every religion, from the Good Samaritan \nto the compassionate Buddha. Do \nunto others as you would have them do unto \nyou. Well, who doesn't \nwant to be touched with care and compassion? Who \ndoesn't like others to help them feel better and lighten their load? \nMassage is compassion \nturned Into action. \nEFTA00008144\n\n \nChapter \n7: \nThe \nRules \nfor \nReceiving \nMassage \n99 \nRule \n#8: \nIt's \nCool \nto \nBe \nNude \n(Or \nNot) \nYou \nare, \nwhether \nyou \nlike \nit \nor \nnot, \nnaked \nall \nthe \ntime \nbeneath \nyour \nclothes. \nYou \nwere \nborn \nnude, \njust \nlike \nevery \nother \nhuman \non \nthe \nplanet. \nNudity \nis \nnat-\nural. \nHowever, \neach \nculture \ndevelops \nits \nown \npeculiar \nattitudes \nabout \nnudity, \nranging \nfrom \nthose \nwho \nconsider \nit \nextremely \nawkward, \nembarrassing, \nand \ninappropriate \nat \nall \ntimes \nto \nthose \nwho \ndon't \nthink \ntwice \nabout \nit, \nanytime, \nanywhere, \nfor \nany \nreason. \nNeither \nattitude \nIs \nhealthier \nthan \nthe \nother, \nthey're \njust \ndifferent. \nThe \nkey \nfor \nmassage \nsituations \nis \nto \nrespect \nthe \nattitudes \nof \nboth \npeople \nat \nall \ntimes. \nIf \neither \nthe \nperson \nreceiving \nor \ngiving \nthe \nmassage \nis \nuncomfortable \nwith \nany \nkind \nof \nskin \nexposure \nwhatsoever, \nyou're \nmuch \nbetter \noff \nto \ncover \nthat \narea \nup \nand \nkeep \nit \ncovered \nthan \nto \ncause \ndiscomfort. \nThis \napplies \nto \nthe \nentire \nbody, \neven \nthe \nlegs \nand \narms, \nwhich \nmost \npeople \nare \ncomfortable \nexposing. \nAlthough \ngliding \nan \noiled \npalm \nis \ndefinitely \neasier \nover \nbare \nskin \nthan \ncov-\nered \nskin, \nmassage \nhas \nother \nmoves \nbesides \ngliding, \nand \nyou \ncan \ngive \na \nvery \ngood \nmassage \nto \na \nfully \nclothed \nperson \n(I \nshow \nyou \nhow \nin \nChapter \n11). \nRemember \nthis \nmessage: \nWhen \nyou \nreceive \na \nmassage, \nyou're \nokay \nthe \nway \nyou \nare \n— \nnude \nor \ntotally \ncovered \nup. \nJust \nbe \ncomfortable. \nRule \n#9: \nyou're \nthe \nBoss \nEven \nthough \nyou're \nlying \ndown \nwith \nyour \neyes \nclosed \nduring \nmost \nmassages, \nyou're \nstill \nin \ncharge. \nWith \nthe \nslightest \nword \nor \ngesture, \nyou \ncan \nchange \nthe \ncourse \nof \nthe \nproceedings. \nDeeper \npressure? \nIt's \nup \nto \nyou. \nSlower \npace? \nThat's \nyour \ncall, \ntoo. \nLess \nchit-chat? \nYour \ndecision. \nYou \nhave \ncomplete \nauthority \nto \nchange \nanything \nthat \nmay \nbe \nmaking \nyou \nuncomfortable. \nRequesting \na \nchange \nof \nmusic, \nfor \nexample, \nis \nperfectly \nper-\nmissible, \nas \nIs \nturning \nthe \nmusic \noff \naltogether. \nIf \nyou \nwant \nto \nbe \ncovered \nmore \nmodestly, \njust \nask. \nWhatever \nyou \nsay \ngoes. \nYou \ncan \nsay \nexactly \nwhat \nyou're \nfeeling, \neven \nending \nthe \nmassage \nat \nany \ntime, \nfor \nany \nreason \nyou \nwant. \nPeriod. \nYou \nalways \nhave \nthe \noption \nof \nstanding \nup \nand \nsaying, \n\"Enough!\" \nOf \ncourse, \nwhen \nyou're \nreceiving \na \nmassage \nfrom \na \nprofessional \nmassage \ntherapist, \nit \nmakes \nsense \nto \nlisten \nto \nher \nsuggestions. \nIf \nshe \nthinks \nyou \nshould \nquiet \ndown \nand \nfocus \non \nthe \nmassage \nrather \nthan \nconversation, \nfor \nexample, \nit's \nprobably \nbest \nto \nfollow \nher \nadvice. \nHowever, \ndon't \nmistakenly \nplace \nyour-\nself \nin \na \nsubmissive \nrole \nJust \nbecause \nyou're \nlying \ndown. \nEven \nif \nthe \nother \nperson \nknows \nmore \nabout \nmassage \nthan \nyou, \nis \nolder \nthan \nyou, \nor \nhas \na \nlouder \npersonality \nthan \nyou, \nthe \nbottom \nline \nis, \nwhen \nyou're \nreceiving \na \nmas-\nsage, \nyou're \nthe \nboss. \nEFTA00008145\n\n100 \nPart II: The Art of \nReceiving Massage  \nRate #10: Be \nGratetut \nDuring the massage itself, spend some time being grateful for what you're \nexperiencing in the moment.

Massage affects the entire \nbody, and it's best if your \nmassage therapist knows as \nmuch as possible about your health history. If \na \nmassage therapist doesn't ask you to fill out a form, \nhowever, it doesn't mean \nshe doesn't care \nabout your health; that's just her \nstyle, or the policy of the \nspa or health club \nwhere she works. \nAnother type of \ncommunication you share with your massage therapist is \nboth nonverbal and non-written — body \nlanguage. Your massage therapist, \nby profession an expert in the \nlanguage of the body, may try her best not to \nlaugh out \nloud while your body silently struggles with \nembarrassment and \nanxiety at the \nprospect of getting your first massage. Just kidding! \nActually, as \nyou may imagine, massage therapists \nbecome very adept at making their \nclients feel at \nease in a potentially uneasy situation. It's the \nlittle things they \ndo (and don't do) that make \nthe difference. It could be where \nthey point their \neyes or how they manipulate sheets and towels to \nmake you feel protected \nand respected. It's the way they just \nrelax and accept you when you make \nyourself vulnerable by being there. \nBesides, they're just as eager to make a good \nfirst impression as you are, \npartly because it's \nhuman nature and partly because they want you as a \nrepeat customer! \nGetting \ncomfortable \nIn most massage \nsituations, after you arrive and go through your \ncommunica-\ntion \nrituals, the next step is undressing and \nlying down. This can be tricky. \nIt's the moment many people \ndread, and the one that keeps them from ever \ngetting \na \"real\" massage. The way it works is \nlike this: \n1. \nThe massage therapist explains how \nyou're supposed to get up on the \nmassage table, \npointing out where your head should be, \nand whether \nyou should be face up or facedown. If \nyou ask whether you should get \ncompletely \nundressed or not, the stock answer is \nsomething to the effect \nof, \"Most people take all their clothes \noff, but you can get undressed to the \nlevel \nof your comfort.\" Then she leaves the \nroom. Do not \nfeel intimidated \nby \"most people\" who all so \nbravely get naked for their massages. it's up \nto you if you \nwant to keep your underwear or some \nclothes on, and It's OK \neither way. Refer to Rule # 8 in \nChapter 7, \"It's cool to be nude (or not).\" \n2. \nAfter the massage therapist is out of the \nroom, remember to take your \ntime. Don't worry about \ngetting barged in on, cause it ain't \ngonna \nhappen. She knocks before coming back in, and \nusually she waits much \nlonger than necessary to make \nsure you have plenty of time. Take this \nopportunity to remove Jewelry, watches, and anything else that \nmay \nEFTA00008149\n\n7 04 Part II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nentangle a finger (wedding bands are okay). Usually, there is a little table \nor shelf to hold your belongings, and you can find a hook for your \nclothes. If you have long hair, you may want to tie it back so It doesn't \nget in the way. Also, it's a good idea to visit the bathroom before you lay \ndown on the table, even if you don't think you have to go. Getting a mas-\nsage with a full bladder takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it. \n3. Lie down on the table in the position you were told and pull the sheet or \ntowel up over your body, completely covering yourself. \n4. The massage therapist knocks and asks if it's okay to enter again. When \nyou give the go-ahead, she comes in, and then \nusually washes her \nhands. She does this for three \nreasons: \n•  To reassure you \nthat her hands are clean \n•  To wash away any dirt or \ngerms she may have contacted since \nscrubbing them the last time a few minutes earlier \n•  In many areas the law requires it \n5. She makes sure you're comfortable, checking the room temperature, \ntucking the towel around \nyour body, and adjusting the lights and music. \nShe may also slip a little pillow or piece of foam rubber beneath your \nknees, ankles, or head to help support you. These cushions are called \nbolsters, and they really help you \nfeel more comfortable. If  you feel a \nstrain or lack of support in any area of your body, just let the massage \ntherapist know. \n6. After everything's set, your massage therapist uncovers just the area that \nshe is going to work on. If she plans to massage your neck, she pulls the \nsheet down to the top of your chest. Massage therapists always leave \nwomen's breasts covered, and no one's \n\"private parts\" ever get exposed. \nSometimes no matter how hard you try, all these \nmassage rules go out the \nwindow. Like the time I was \nworking at a spa and had the opportunity to mas-\nsage Dr. Ruth Westheimer. I'll never forget the experience because, for one \nthing, she threw her robe off before I ever \nhad the chance to leave the room \nand let her get \nundressed. Then, full of confidence, she strode to the massage \ntable and tried to climb aboard. I say \"tried\" because, as It turns out, she \nwas \na little too short \nto reach. I  wanted to reach down and give her a boost, but I \ncouldn't figure out how to do it without getting a little \ntoo personal with Dr. \nRuth, so I averted \nmy eyes as best I could and offered ineffectual words of \ngeneral \nencouragement. \nLuckily, she knew what \nto do. \"Don't worry!\" she chimed. \"I've had this prob-\nlem \nbefore!\" Then she proceeded to push a chair up next to \nthe massage \ntable, climb onto it, and from there \ncrawl up onto the table, where I  Immedi-\nately covered her with a sheet in the proper professional fashion. \nEFTA00008150\n\nChapter 8: Your \nFirst Massage \nAppointment — Step-by-Step 105 \nAvoiding the \nbathrobe dance \nAs a massage \ntherapist in spas, on many occa-\nsions I've entered the massage room to \nbegin a \nmassage only to find my client lying there, face \ndown, rigid with nervousness, with her bathrobe \ntied super-tight around her waist Before leav-\ning the room to let her disrobe, I'd instructed her \nto take her robe off and lie \ndown under the sheet \nI'd provided, but some clients are too tense to \nhear those \ninstructions. \nAnd so that's when we begin the bathrobe \ndance. \nThe bathrobe dance \nis an awkward ordeal that \nusually last4 about two minutes. While the mas-\nsage \ntherapist tries to assist as best he can, the \ndent rolls, wriggles, and writhes herway out of \nthe bathrobe \nwhile remaining face down \nand \ncompletely covered at all \ntimes. The client's \nrump usually \nscoots up in the air, arms and \nlegs splay every which way, and her \nface turns \nbright \nred. \nThen, after \nthe robe is finally loosened \nfrom \naround her body and \nher arms -are out of the \narmholes, the \nmassage therapist haste drape a \nsheet \nor towel over it-before \nskillfully slipping \nthe robe from \nunderneath. This entire procedure \nleaves the client even \nmore tense than when \nshe started, \nand more embarrassed \nthan she \nWould havebeen if she'd \nsimply listened to the \ninstructions. \nIf you find yourself on the table \nstill wrapped in your robe, make things \neasy \non \nyourself. Don't wear yourself out before the \nmassage by wrestling with \nyour robe. Instead, say \nsomething like, \"That was so silly of me,\" and ask the \nmassage therapist to leave the room again to give you \nanother chance. Then \nget off the table, slip out of \nyour robe, and lie down beneath the sheet like \nyou were supposed to \nin the \nfirst place. \nIf, rather than a bathrobe, you \nhave a towel wrapped around you before the \nmassage, make \nsure not to lie down directly upon the knotted \npart so you \nhave to do the \"rock-n-roll\" to loosen it. \nInstead, open the towel up and lie \nstraight on \nthe table with the towel still covering your backside. \nThe first touch \nThe \nvery first \nmoment of contact \nbetween you \nand \nthe \nmassage \ntherapist can \ntell you an awful lot about how the rest of the \nmassage is going to feel. Each \nmassage \ntherapist has a \"personality\" in her hands that you \nquickly get to know. \nWhen the massage therapist is closely attuned to you and your body, this \nmoment can be almost sacred. It's an intimate Joining\n-together of your con-\nsciousness with the \nconsciousness of another person, which Just plain \ndoesn't happen that often in the modern world. \nEFTA00008151\n\n106 \nPart II: \nThe Art of Receiving Massage  \nTake advantage of this initial contact by tuning in especially closely to what's \nhappening in your own body. In the same way that you pick up a lot of infor-\nmation about the person who's touching you, she's \npicking up a lot of \ninformation.about you. It's a good opportunity for you to concentrate on \nyour \nbreathing and relaxation. \nDuring the \nmassage \nDuring the \nmassage, your massage therapist continues to keep you covered \nat all times, only exposing those areas that \nshe's working on at the moment. \nMassage therapists are experts at this \ntechnique, called draping, and they \nmake you feel completely comfortable, almost as if you were fully \ndressed \nduring the experience. \nYes, you are comfortable and modestly \ncovered the whole time, but what are \nyou \nsupposed to actually DO while you're getting a massage? That's the \nbiggest problem many people have, especially \"type A\" people. They figure \nthat getting a massage is just plain \nboring and that's why they decide not to \ndo it. \nOkay, so getting a massage is not exactly the same as bungee jumping from a \nhot-air balloon, attending a rock concert, or brokering a multi\n-million dollar \ndeal in a corporate \nboardroom. But if you let it, massage can become com-\npelling, \nthrilling \neven, in a very \ninternal kind \nof way. It's \nlike taking a \nroller \ncoaster ride inside \nyour own skin. \nThe trick is not to try and make anything happen, \nbut to Just let whatever \nhappens happen. You're \nnot supposed to do anything. Your massage thera-\npist \ntells you if you have to move a certain way or breathe a certain way or \nvisualize a certain \nimage. Besides \nthat, \nthe less you \ndo the \nbetter. Think of \nmassage as a trip to the beach. You're supposed to just lie there and do \nnothing. \n\"But what if I fall asleep?\" you gasp. \n\"Wouldn't that insult the massage thera-\npist?\" Not at all. In fact, \nsome massage therapists take it as a compliment \nthat \nthey can get their clients to relax this deeply. \nHowever, your creative input to \nthe massage process is \njust as valuable as the massage therapist's input, so \nit's \nbetter if you stay awake. And, If you snooze \nthrough a massage, you may \nbe missing \nsome of the most \npleasurable \nmoments of your life. Who wants to \npay good money \nfor a nap? \nIf you're the \ntype that cannot conceive of an entire hour spent doing \nnothing, \ntry this: Talk to the massage therapist \nabout things that matter, like your \nhealth. Most massage people are pretty well versed in the art of taking-care-\nof-yourself, and you stand a good \nchance of having a conversation that goes \nbeyond mere \nchitchat, offering you some real \nbenefits. \nEFTA00008152\n\n \nChapter \n8: \nYour \nFirst \nMassage \nAppointment— \nStep\n-by\n-Step \n107 \nUnder \npressure \nSo, \nwhat's \nthe \nri\nght \namount \nof \npressure \nto \nask

\nPart II: \nThe Art of Receiving Massage  \ngreatly detract from your experience. You may need to make an extra effort \nto enforce rule # 9 from Chapter 7. You're the boss, even if you're in her \nhome, and for \nthis hour you're in charge. \nSpas \nSome of the most beautiful massage environments \nin the world can be found \nin spas, and \nyou find out more about them in Chapter 15. Grand destination \nspas dot \nthe \nmap in \nevery state \nnow, and \nif \nyou \nlook in your Yellow Pages, \nyou're likely to find a day spa that you can check out right in your own town. \nWhile spas are often \npleasant and luxurious, there are a couple things \nyou \nshould \nkeep in mind when signing up for a massage in \none: \n3 Massage therapists \nin spas only keep a (usually small) percentage of the \nprofits, which sometimes leads them to give less \nthan their absolute \nbest \nwork. \n3 \nMassage \nTherapists in spas are \"on the clock,\" and you're likely to get a \nmassage that is exactly 50 minutes long, so she has time to prepare the \nroom for the \nnext client. It's a rare massage therapist who can still give \nyou a feeling of timeless bliss within that shortened hour. \n3 Often, the style of massage given in spas is dictated by a lowest-\ncommon-denominator mentality, and massage therapists are not allowed \nto use their advanced techniques for fear of alienating a clientele who \nwants \"just a \nrubdown.\" \nThese warnings notwithstanding, there's no reason to believe you won't \nreceive an incredible massage in a \nspa. Some of the best massage therapists \nwork in them. Also, if you end up finding a massage therapist you really like, \nyou can ask her whether she also takes private clients \noutside the spa, which \nmay mean a better \ndeal for her and a better massage for you. Be diplomatic \nwhen doing this though, as many spas have a policy against \ntheir massage \ntherapists \"stealing\" customers in this \nway. \nCruise ships \nCruise ships are fun places to get massages, if you don't mind \nrocking back \nand forth a little bit while you're on \nthe table. Almost every ship has its own \nspa, \nand you can visit for a half-hour or an hour of \nmassage as easily as visit-\ning the midnight buffet. A massage \nduring your cruise may add to the exotic \nflavor of \nyour trip, but there are a couple less-than-exotic \npoints to keep in \nmind as well: \nEFTA00008158\n\n \nChapter 8: \nYour \nFirst Massage \nAppointment— Step\n-by-Step 113 \n3 \nBecause floor space and \nportholes are at a premium \non ships, massage \nrooms onboard are usually \nteeny tiny little quarters with no \nnatural \nlight. If  you're used \nto ample luxurious massage \nspaces, you may feel a \nlittle \nclaustrophobic in this environment. \n3 \nEven more so than in spas \non land, shipboard massage \ntherapists are \npart of a massage \nassembly line, and \nsometimes the massages are lim-\nited to half an hour. It's rough to \ncoax the best from your massage \ntherapist \nbecause she sees so many people \ncome and go — none of \nwhom are repeat customers. \n3 Make sure to sign up early — as \nsoon as you come on board — \nIf you're \nthinking about \ngetting a massage during \nyour cruise because the best \ntime slots fill up fast. You \nmay want an appointment \nduring a \"sea day,\" \nrather than in port, so you don't have \nto decide between getting a mas-\nsage and going ashore to sightsee or shop. \nHotels \nMany \nhotels have their own spas, so all \nyou have to do to book a \nmassage is \ncall the spa desk. \nFor those hotels without a spa, \nyou'll want to contact the \nconcierge to arrange your appointment. \nOne note about concierges: \nWatch out! They often take a good \nchunk of the \nmassage \ntherapist's fee for themselves, and \nthey have a stable of ever-ready \nmassage therapists at hand who \nallow them to do that. So, the \nquality is not \nalways the best. \nYou may be better off \nplacing a call directly to a \nprofessional \nthat you find listed under \nlicensed practitioners in the local \nYellow Pages or \nnewspaper. That way you can avoid the fee \nand perhaps find higher-quality \nwork as well. \nAll in all, hotel rooms \nare on the low end of the totem \npole as far as receiving \nmassages go. They're impersonal, \nthey're cramped, and they \noften have that \nfunny hotel-room\n-smell that no amount of \nincense or positive thinking \ncan \novercome. If you find yourself in \na hotel room somewhere with \nnowhere else \nto go for your \nmassage, and only a concierge to \nput your trust in, do what \nseasoned massage recipients the \nworld over have done for \nyears: enjoy it \nanyway. (See \nChapter 17 for more info about hotel \nmassages.) \nHealth clubs \nHealth clubs are becoming \nbetter places to receive \nmassages.

The \nanswer is D. It's definitely true that your partner \nappreciates it if you take a \nlittle time to set up a \nspecial environment or \"massage mood\" before you \nbegin the actual massage. And, even if \nyou're in a less-than-ideal environ-\nment, don't worry. You can materialize a magical \nmassage mood Just about \nanywhere if you use some of \nthe ideas in this chapter to create your own \n\"inner \nchamber.\" \nCreating the Inner Chamber \nOne of the \nbig secrets to giving a good massage has \nvery little to do with the \nmassage itself. It has to do, rather, with \nwhere the massage is happening. And \nI'm \nnot talking about exotic locales like Bali or Atlantic City. I'm referring to \nmore accessible locations, like your bedroom or the couch in your den. \nEFTA00008163\n\n8\n Part The \nArt of \nGiving \nMassage  \nSo how do you turn these everyday places into someplace special? It's easy; \nthe trick is to involve all the senses. \nMassage, of course, relies heavily upon the senses for its effects. Your sense \nof touch, \nespecially, is being bombarded the entire time you're giving or \nreceiving a massage. But it would be a mistake to neglect the other senses; \nthey can add greatly \nto your massage experience, too. \nThe sense of taste doesn't usually play a big part in massage, unless of \ncourse you like to use \nedible massage oils like \nstrawberry, almond, \nand \nmint \nthat \nare ... whoops, I think we're straying a little beyond the scope of this \nchapter. Check out Chapter 19 for more information on sensual massage, \nincluding the use of all kinds of flavored oils. \nAnyway, for now let's concentrate \non the three remaining senses that come \ninto play during a massage experience, also known as the 3 S's of your inner \nchamber: \n3 Scents \n3 Sights \n3 \nSounds \nScents \nProfessional massage therapists often coach their \nclients through some deep-\nbreathing techniques as part of the massage. And, as you may suspect, all \nthat breathing includes quite a bit of smelling, too. That's part of the reason \nwhy massage pros have so much concern about the \nway that their work-\nrooms \nsmell. In addition, they also know how powerful the sense of smell can \nbe for healing and relaxation. \nJust sniffing a whiff of corn muffins like the ones your Aunt Betty used to \nbake when you visited her on weekends as a \nkid Is enough to send you reel-\ning back through \nthe years, right? Why is that so? Aromas trigger a mighty \nemotional response because the molecules that \nenter your nose don't mess \naround. They do not pass GO; they \ndo not collect $200. Instead, they take a \ndirect route straight \ninto the mldbrain area, which is the seat of your \nemo-\ntions and memories. This fact is a key to the \npower of aromatherapy. \nAromatherapy \nif you use advanced grammatical \ntechniques to break down the word aro-\nmatherapy, you \ndiscover that it means \"therapy with aromas.\" Anal \nSo, does \nthat mean therapy with just any \naroma, such as the aroma of sauteed onions, \nfor \nexample, or the aroma of diesel fuel at dawn? \nEFTA00008164\n\n Chapter 9: \nMassage Moods: \nGetting the \nSetting \nRight 19 \nHardly. \nAromatherapy is the use \nof \nhighly concentrated \nessential \noils from \ncertain plants to stimulate the brain. This stimulation causes a positive effect \non \nthe nervous and glandular systems and thus the entire body. During a \nmassage, you can utilize \naromatherapy in several ways. In Chapter 11, you \nfind out how to mix up an aromatherapy \nmassage oil, but for now let's focus \non \nthree other aromatherapy tips that can help you \nscent your massage \nspace. \n3 \nDiffusers: As the name suggests, a diffuser diffuses aroma into the air. \nSeveral inexpensive models ($10415) are available that \nuse a miniature \nfan. Simply place a few drops of your favorite oil on a cotton pad, turn \non \nthe fan, and the scent of essential oils fills the room. \n3 \nCandles: Many commercially available candles have essential oils \nworked right into the wax, \nand burning one during a massage is a great \nway to combine effects in two of the three S's, sight and \nscent. Until \nrecently, you had to visit \na specialty shop to purchase aromatherapy \ncandles, but now they're even available at your local grocery store. S.C. \nJohnson, for example, makers of Glade air fresheners, is now in the aro-\nmatherapy market with candles and \nsprays. \n3 \nBulb rings: These little \ndoodads \nwere popular in the \n1970s when they \nwere used to cover up even more exotic aromas floating around the \nroom at parties. Now they're making a comeback as aromatherapy aids. \nBasically, they're floppy little \nrings that you place over a light bulb. \nWhen you sprinkle several drops of essential oil into the ring and turn \non the bulb, Presto! — instant aromatherapy. \nIf aromatherapy \nis something you're keenly interested in, I would recommend \nAromatherapy For Dummies by Kathi Keville, published by IDG Books \nWorldwide, a book that promises to answer that age-old question, \"How can I \nsmell \nbetter and feel better at the \nsame time?\" \nIncense \nThe musky, natural scents that burning \nincense creates can turn your inner , \nchamber into a mystical and exotic environment, even if in reality it's just \nyour guest bedroom. The \nproblem is, many people overdo it with incense, \nfumigating the room \nwith enough mystical and exotic smoke to choke them-\nselves, their partner, and any unsuspecting insects living in the walls. This is \nnot \ngood. \nWhen it comes to incense, a little goes a long way. Use it with moderation, \nand you can create Just the right mood. If you're using one of those long thick \nsticks of incense, snap It off X of the way down and burn just the last bit. Also, \nyou can crack a window open, weather \npermitting, to circulate a little fresh \nair with the \nsmoke. \nEFTA00008165\n\n120 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage  \nAn altar to the \nmassage gods \nSome people \ngo so far as to create \na special \naltar in the area \nwhere they give their \nmas-\nsages. This is going a bit \nout into Shirley \nMacLeine \nland, I  realize, but when \nyou think \nabout it,  it makes \nsense. A massage can be a \nkind of  shared spiritual experience (See Rule \n#7 in Chapter 7), \nand an altar is a way to \ncom-\nmemorate that. \nSo \nwhat should be on a massage \naltar, you ask? \nYou can place the objects mentioned elsewhere \nin this chapter, such \nas water fountains, can-\ndles, incense burners, and flowers \non your altar. \nThen you can \ngo a step further and add \na  pho-\ntograph or two as well. \nPick a  subject that \nreminds you \nof spiritual things, such as \na photo \nof the Dalai Lama, \nSaint Francis, or \nwhales \ncavorting in \nthe waves. \nIf  you \nspend time meditating \nor simply sitting \nquietly at your \naltar, you can embue the space \nwith a quiet energy. People \nwho join you there \nmay notice the \ndifference. I  don't \nknow if this is \ndue to an actual \nexchange of peaceful mole-\ncules, an increase in negative ions, or what, but \nit can definitely be felt. \nThere \nare thousands of brands and \"flavors\" \nof \nIncense. \nMy favorite is the \nNag Champa scent, which, \nalthough I've never been there, \nreminds me of a \nsacred \nmeditation cave in the \nHimalayas. \nFlowers \nNothing beats the scent of fresh \nflowers in your massage area. You \ndon't need \na big vase and a big \nbudget to make it happen \neither. All that's necessary is a \nsmall bowl, a cup, or a mug \nfrom the kitchen cabinet that \nyou fill with water, \nand a single flower. Roses or \ngardenias work especially well. \nSnip the flower \noff the stem and \nfloat it on the water. This \nfills the air with scent for hours \nor \neven days. \nIf you want to get \nreally romantic, spread some \nfresh petals on the bed or \nother massage \nsurface to set the mood. \nCleopatra had her love chamber \nfilled a foot deep with rose \npetals before Anthony made his big \nentrance. \nSights \nIt may sound funny to focus on the sights of a massage space \nbecause, after \nall, the person receiving the massage \nwill probably have her eyes closed \nmost of \nthe time anyway. But during those few \nminutes when she first enters, \nand whenever she opens her \neyes, she'll soak in her surroundings. There are \na few simple things that you can use to add to the relaxing ambience: \nn 3 Candles: Candles \ncast an enchanting glow over any \nmassage experience, \nand they can add to the scent as \nwell, as I  mention earlier. \nEFTA00008166\n\n Chapter 9: Massage \nMoods: Getting the Setting Right \n121 \n3 Flowers: Even a \nsmall bunch of silk flowers placed \nwith care near the \nmassage area shows this is \nsomeplace special. \n3 Lighting: \nYou can do some simple things with lighting to make your \nspace massage\n-friendly. \n• Turn the lights down low. This helps the person on the receiving \nend concentrate \nmore on the massage, perhaps because she won't \nfeel like \nyou are scrutinizing her body under \na microscope. \n• \nThrow a silk scarf over a lampshade to \ncreate instant mood light-\ning during a massage. \n3 Color Drape the area with \nsoft colorful fabrics. \nSounds \nCarefully selected \nsounds serve two main \npurposes during a massage: \n0 \n3 \nThey add \nto the mood. \n3 \nThey \nmask other, distracting, sounds like traffic noises and TVs. \nThere are a number of really \ninteresting ways to make sound a part of \nyour \nmassage, and you may find that some massage pros \ncarry an entire arsenal of \nsound makers to add to \ntheir clients' experience. Some of my favorites \ninclude: \n3 \nTibetan meditation bowls: \nThese look like simple brass bowls, but \nwhen you glide a \nwooden instrument along the rim, \nthey sing out beauti-\nfully with rich vibrant tones. \n3 Ting shaks: Mother \nTibetan invention, you strike \nthese heavy brass \nbells together to form a clear, long-lasting \ntone that sets a meditative \nmood for a \nmassage. \n3 Gongs: Yes, miniature versions, complete with a little gong hammer, are \navailable. \n3 \nWind chimes: A classic in \nthe relaxing-sounds category, there are liter-\nally thousands of types available. If you can't be \nnear an open window to \nhear the chimes, place \nthem indoors near an oscillating fan to \nsimulate \nblowing breezes. \nAnd, if \nall else fails ... earplugs work \nwonders. You can get them at your local \ndrugstore. \nWater \nYou \nknow those cute little burbling pots filled with rocks and miniature \nwaterfalls? You can find them in a \nlot of gift shops these days, and while they \nare a tad \noverpriced, they definitely add a lot to \nthe ambience of a massage. If \nEFTA00008167\n\n122 \nPart III: \nThe Art of Giving Massage  \nyou're the industrious type, you \ncan overcome the price \nproblem by building \na little indoor \nfountain for yourself. All it takes is a \ncontainer, some rocks, and \na small submersible water pump. \nOf \ncourse, being outside near a \nsource of natural flowing water is a \ngreat \nchoice, too, but then \nyou have to consider other \ndetails, such as tempera-\nture, rain, \ninsects, and privacy. \nOne thing to \nremember — the sound of running \nwater seems to have a power-\nful effect on the bladder. Make extra sure your partner visits the bathroom \nbefore receiving a massage with a waterfall nearby. \nMusic \nMusic, of course, is the most popular type of sound used to complement mas-\nsage. In most big spas, for example, they pump music directly into the \nmassage rooms from a central \nsound system, putting the guests in the right \nmood to \nrelax and unwind. \nOne massage manufacturing company built stereo speakers \nright into the \nbed of a massage table \nso that when you lie down on it, the \nmusic literally \nvibrates you. While this \nmay be going a bit far, music is still the best and easi-\nest way for you to include the element of sound in your massage. \nAn entire industry has \nsprung up to provide music appropriate for massage. If \nyou want to experience some of the most popular massage \nmusic, try putting \none of the following \ntapes or CDs on the next time you exchange \na massage: \n3 \nGeorge Winston's December \n3 Pachabel's Cannon \n3 Deuter Ecstasy \n3 Anything by Stephen Halpern \n3 Brian Eno, Musk for Airports \n3 Ray \nLynch, Musk to Disappear Into \n3 \nEnya, \nespecially her Orinoco Flow CD \n3 The Cowboy Junkies, Trinity \nSession (a personal, offbeat favorite) \n3 Yanni, \nespecially his In My Time \n3 \nAny \nrelaxing classical music • \nDon't get the wrong idea here, though. Massage \nmusic doesn't necessarily \nhave to be flutes or harps or Yanni 'til you yawn. You \ncan be creative in your \nchoices, and sometimes the best massages are given to the most unlikely \naccompaniment. See the sidebar \"Reggae massage.\" \nEFTA00008168\n\n Chapter 9: \nMassage \nMoods: Getting the \nSetting Right \n23 \n4.tat mit\nReggae massage \nOne day whew! was in \ncharge of the \nmassage \ncrew at-a \nlarge spa in-Florida, I \nsuddenly was \ncompletely fed up \nwith the droning \nof flutes, \nharps, \nand syrupy synthesizer music \nthat poured \nendlessly out of the \nstereo speakers in each of \nthe 24 massage \nrooms. Heading \nto the sound \ncontrol room, I secretly \nexchanged the -well-\nworn New \nAge CDs for some-reggae \ndiscs with \ndistinctively upbeat \nsounds. \nIt was the middle of \na lazy, rainy afternoon. The \nmassage \nrooms \nwere \nfi\nlled with customers \nwho \nwere all paying \nupwards of $5,000 \nper week to \nbe there, and I wasn't \nsure exactly what the \nreactionwouldtbe. \nWould•the:customers com-\nplain? Would \nI be fired? \nAfter just \ntwo hours, \ntheverdict came in, and \nsomeone \npassedine the message . . . \n\"Steve, \nthe \nspatirector wants to see you.inher. \noffice.\" \nGulp. \nWhen I arrived, the \ndirector had an expression \nof profound curiosity \non her face. \"Do you know \nwhat was going on with the music in the mas-\nsage roomsthis \nafternoon?\" she asked. \n\"I... urn, \nwell... \" \n\"Because whatever itwas, the customers loved \nit. Two \nof them even wanted to know where they \ncould purchase a copy for \nthemselves! Nobody \nhas ever asked that\n-before.\" \nInas glad to be \noff the hook, and I was \nhappyto \nknow that most people seemed \nto agree-with \nme on the subject of massage music. It doesn't \nalways have to be so ... well, tranquilizing. \nAs a final note \nabout music, remember that the \nperson receiving the massage \nis always right. This includes \nbeing right about the choice of music, even if \nthat choice \nmakes absolutely no sense to \nyou. I had one client who always \ninsisted on receiving his \nmassages to the accompaniment of \nthe local rock & \nroll radio \nstation. Go \nfigure. \nLocation \nlocation location \nOnce, in a \ntypically cramped New York \nCity apartment, I had to give a mas-\nsage on the only available \nlarge flat surface, which turned \nout to be a wooden \ndining \nroom table. We lay a few blankets \nand pillows down on it, and I scur-\nried from side to side \ndodging walls and other furniture, \nbut in the end my \nclient \nreported feeling quite comfortable, \nand he loved his massage. I \nwouldn't \nrecommend this, but it just \ngoes to show that you definitely \ndon't need a \nfancy \nexpensive massage table or a \nspecial peaceful room in your house in \norder to give a good \nmassage. \nEFTA00008169\n\n24 \nPart III: The Art of Giving Massage  \nYou can comfortably give \nmassages in any room, \nIncluding living rooms, bed-\nrooms, family rooms, and as the \nstory above points out, even the dining \nroom. There are a few issues you want to \nkeep in mind, though, when decid-\ning \nwhere to give a massage: \n3 \nPrivacy: It's important to respect the level of privacy the person receiv-\ning the massage desires. If possible, \nchoose a room where you can close \nthe \ndoors to keep other people out. On the other \nhand, some people \nactually prefer to be less \nprivate, and they are more comfortable in an \narea \nwith some activity. \n3 Warmth: Avoid areas \nwith a draft or air conditioning vent directly over-\nhead. \n3 \nIntentions: It may be a good idea to avoid giving massage in a bedroom \nif the person receiving is not \nyour romantic partner. That way \nyou avoid \npossibly giving the wrong message. \n3 \nSpace: \nYou need some space to maneuver around In — \nperhaps more \nthan you realize. Before you begin, make sure you have enough room on \nall sides to move without disturbing your partner. \nPrivacy, \nplease \nWhen someone's receiving a massage, she \nwants to pretend that she's on a \nsecluded tropical isle, with no one else around \nfor miles. She's a Polynesian \nprincess, the center of attention, and the person giving the massage is \nfocused on her and her alone. Exotic birds are floating \noverhead, and one \nlone \nwhite sail puffs out on the aquamarine horizon ... \nthen, suddenly, she \nhears a \nvoice: \"Bart Just threw up on my homeworki\" \nYes, it's \ndifficult for your partner to achieve her ultimate \nromantic illusion if, \nin real life, she's receiving \nher massage on the couch in your den, with The \nSimpsons turned up full blast on the TV. \nDo your \npartner a favor — indulge her in her illusions. While it's not always \npossible to take a trip to \nFiji to give your massage, you can avoid some of the \nmore obvious distractions quite easily: \n3 Turn off \nthe TV. \n3 \nPut up a little \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. \n3 Try to schedule the massage for a time when there are few interruptions. \n3 \nTurn off the ringer on the \nphone and turn down the volume on the \nanswering machine. \nEFTA00008170\n\n \nChapter 9: \nMassage Moods: \nGetting the \nSetting \nRight \nThe \"massage mood\" \nWhat I've included in this chapter so far are the external aspects of the Inner \nchamber. \nBut, of course, when It comes to inner chambers, it's the inside that \ncounts, and that's what this section is \nabout. Even if you find yourself in a \nless-than-ideal situation \nto give massage, with distractions \nabounding, no \nmusic to listen to, and not a candle in \nsight, you can still create the most \nimportant aspect of that Inner chamber, the \"massage mood.\" \nWhen you first lay your \nhands upon someone else to give them a massage, \nwhat do you have in your mind? Chances are, you're a little nervous, a little \nuncertain of how the \nother person is going to receive you. And that's all right. \nIt means you care. But how about how she's feeling? You, as \nthe giver, are in \ncharge of creating the \noptimal mood for her experience. \nIn order to create an appropriate mood for the other person, what you have \nto do first is get into that mood yourself. By \nimagining yourself in one of the \nfollowing four \npersonas as you begin a massage — saint, doctor, mother, \nbuddy — you can quickly adopt the mood that goes with it. Then, you can \ngive your partner something that comes from deep inside, creating the true \ninner \nchamber. \nSaint \nPart of giving a good massage is having some simple compassion for the \nperson you're \ntouching. We are, after all, in the same boat, each one of us \nanchored to a fragile \nbody in an uncertain world. You can reach \nout to others \nwhen you massage them, crossing the barriers \nof separation, sending the \nmessage that you understand how they feel. This is the golden rule of most \nreligions; touch others as you \nwould have them touch you. \nDoctor \nIf you're Just a beginner, you \nshouldn't be out there trying to \"fix\" your Aunt \nJeanne's sciatica with your massage techniques. However, it helps to think in \nterms of helping the \nperson feel better, not Just rubbing oil on. As you begin a \nmassage, imagine your hands filled with healing \nenergy, communicating the \nintention to soothe and make whole. \nMother \nWho ever cared about us more than good ole Mom? She had a level of accep-\ntance for our quirks and \nour shortcomings that was Just plain astounding. \nYou can aim that \nsame kind of unconditional love toward your \nmassage part-\nner (at least for that one hour), making him \nfeel perfect just the way he is. \n125 \nEFTA00008171\n\n126 \nPart III: \nThe Art of \nGiving Massage  \nTouching Jos6 \n(While \nvolunteering \nat the \nUniversity of Miarni \nMedical Center AIDS ward, \n(discovered that \nyou can create. a \ncaring compassionate \"mas-\nsage mood\" anywhere, even in a \nsterile \nhospital \nroom. This is the storyof JosE, whom I \nmet \nthere.) \nOn the bright Christmas Eve morning that we \nentered his room, Jose's body was \nwracked \nwith \npain, and he was curled.into a  fetal \nposi-\ntion on his \nhospital bed. His family stood at the \nfoot of the bed arranged like a choir— mother, \nfather, aunts, uncles, \nsiblings, and friends. All of \nthem•with their hands at their sides, standing \nseveral feet away. \nJackson Memorial Hospital did not employ Rob \nBoyte, a  nurse, and me, a massage therapist. \nWe were \nvolunteers.with the P.A.LM.S. \nfounda-\ntion, and \nwe were there to touch Jose. \nYou see, nobody \nelse would touch Jose \nbecause these were.the early days of AIDS \nand \neveryone \nwas still afraid, even the doctors and \nthe other nurses. Even the family members of \nthe victims were afraid. Everyone kept his \ndistance. \nJose had received \na spinal tap the night before. \nConvulsions ran through his \nbody, up to his head \nand back down..He could only speak in broken, \ngrunted syllables. His family \ntranslated for us. \n\"He says he wants the massage,\" said one \nrelative. \n\"He thinks itwould feel good,\" said another. \"Go \nahead, try.\" \nWe approached the bed. Both of \nus stood on the \nsame side, facing Jose's exposed back. Rob \ngently placed one large hand on the back of \nJose's \nneck, not moving it at all. I touched him, \ntoo. Jose didn't relax into the touch; he couldn't \nbecause of the convulsions. He moaned, but not \nwith \npleasure either like many massage clients \ndo. Instead, he moaned with \nsomething deeper, \nalmost like \npain itself, and I knew \nimmediately \nwhat it was. All of the \nfamily members knew \nwhat it \nwas, too. \nJose was letting out the primal moan of some-\none who had not been \ntouched for along time, \natthe \npoint in his life when he most \ndesperately \nneeded to be \ntouched. \nSubtly, Jose pressed his \nback up into my hands. \nI watched the family members lean forward, lift-\ning their hands \nslightly, as if they too were \ntouching Jose, although they \nwere too terrified \nto do \nso themselves. \nSlowly, I stroked down Jose's back, then back \nup again. His skin was \ncold, then hot in turns. \nThe family members stared \nhard at our hands. \nWe were not wearing rubber gloves because \nwe knew AIDS was not \ntransmitted by skin-to-\nskin contact Everyone \nshould have known it, \nbut \nthey didn't \nSlowly, Jose responded. His convulsions sub-\nsided. He became quiet. \nFor a  few minutes, \neveryone there could see \nthat he was all \nwrapped up in the sensation of two other \nhumans, four other hands, touching him, \nsooth-\ning him, being with him in the way that only \nCONTACT can \nprovide. \nThen \nit was time to go. The \nward was filled with \nother \npatients on that Christmas Eve day. Rob \nand I moved to the sink where \nwe washed our \nhands with red \ndisinfectant soap. We \nsmiled at \nthe family, and they \nsmiled back at the two \nstrangers who had just shared such an intimate \nmoment \nWe left the room and moved on. Then, \na  few \nminutes later, we \nheard a  gasp, a  cry, then a \nhigh female wail come \nechoing down the white \nEFTA00008172\n\nChapter 9: Massage Moods: Getting the Setting Right \n127 \ntiled hospital corridor. The family came flowing \nout of Jose's room one by one, their eyes wild \nwith pain, filled with tears. One of the women \nlooked straight into my soul then in that \nhallway \nfor \none brief \nsecond. What I saw in \nher \neyes, \nbehind the pain, was gratitude. For a brief time, \nI had become her hands and \nallowed her to do \nsomething she would never be able to do her-\nself. \nBecause now, it was too \nlate. \nNobody could touch Jose \nanymore. \nBuddy \nDon't let all this serious stuff about saints and doctors scare you away from \ngiving a \nmassage. There's another, more lighthearted, giver's personality, too, \nthat of the buddy. You can Just hang out together and have some fun while \nyou're exchanging massage, and that's perfectly acceptable. Go ahead, put a \nlittle reggae on the CD player. Tell a few Jokes to break the \nIce. \nRelax \nand have \nan easy conversation during the massage. Sometimes this Is the best choice \nwhen your partner is apprehensive about receiving the massage. \nThe story in the sidebar \"Touching Jose\" is an example of how, when It \ncomes time to actually touch a human being, the buddy blends with the saint, \nand the mother and doctor become two sides of the same \ncoin. \nTrading Places \nIt's not that difficult to find a professional massage therapist with whom you \ncan trade money for massage. Money seems to be a great motivational tool \nwhen it comes to getting people to massage you. It can be very tricky, how-\never, to find an amateur. By definition, you are not going to pay the amateur, \nand therefore you must offer some other form of incentive to get him to give \nthe massage. Most frequently, this Incentive comes in the form of a reciprocal \nmassage. But what if that is not enough to motivate your partner? \nI'm trying not to be sexist here, but statistical evidence suggests that one \ngender in particular has motivational problems when it comes to giving mas-\nsage. Yes, I'm talking about males, 95% of whom, when asked by \ntheir loving \npartners to give a massage, develop an instantaneous and very debilitating \ncase of temporary-fatigue-syndrome (TFS). Even the thought of moving just a \npinkie finger suddenly makes them feel very tilled. As soon as the request for \nmassage is withdrawn, however, they bounce back incredibly fast and can \noften be observed playing touch \nfootball just moments later. \nEFTA00008173\n\n1 28 \nPart III: The \nArt of Giving \nMassage  \nHere are some ways to \nmotivate a partner who is the \nunfortunate victim \nof \nTM: \ne \n3 \nSuggest to him that his \nlove life might suffer dire \nconsequences unless \nhe \ngives you a massage. \n3 Suggest to \nhim that his love life could be \ngreatly enhanced were he to be \nso kind as to give you a full hour massage. \n3 \nIn exchange for the massage, \noffer to let him go shopping at his \nfavorite \nstore (camping store, \nhardware store, computer \nstore, or whatever his \ncute \nlittle male fixation may be) and \ndon't bug him about \nspending \nmoney \nthere. \n3 \nIf \nhe agrees to massage you at least three \ntimes, let him pick the destina-\ntion for your next \nvacation (yes, even if it's \nbass fishing on Lake \nOkeechobee). \nYour mate is \nnot the only person with whom \nyou can form a massage-trade \nrelationship. Other \npotential partners include: \n3 \nSomebody who practices \nmassage professionally (it may \nsurprise you \nhow many pros don't receive \nmassage nearly as often as they'd like —\nyour offer to trade, although you're less experienced, is likely to be \nmet \nwith considerable enthusiasm). \n3 Members of your church \n3 Members of your family \n3 \nFriends of \nthe family \n3 Members of a sports team \nyou're on \nmay be challenging at first to find a way to be comfortable trading mas-\nsages. It's an admittedly intimate form \nof sharing, and not everyone takes to \nright away. \nOne good alternative to jumping \nstraight into a full body mas-\nsage is to try some \nseated massage with the clothes still on. You may find \nplenty of non-threatening options in the chapters to come. \nEFTA00008174\n\nChapter 10 \nAll The Right Moves \nIn \nThis Chapter \np \nFinding out about contraindications \n0. Building your \nmassage muscles \nI> Doing the moves \nD \nExploring massage gizmos \n•  0 •  0 0 0 •  •  0 \nOOOOOOOOO 0 0 •  •  0 0 •  OOOOOOOOOOOO 0 0 •  0 0 0 0 •  0 •  •  0 \nyes,this is the chapter where you'll find all those massage moves that \nyou can use to turn your everyday, ordinary hands into \ninstruments of \nirresistible pleasure. Your fingertips and palms will be sought after by \nfriends, \nfamily, co-workers, and complete strangers alike. Everybody will \nsay, \"Use \nsome of those moves on me! Me me me me me!\" \nThen, inflated by your newfound abilities and the quick expertise \nyou acquire \nin these pages, you may find yourself thinking, like many of us did in the \nbeginning, that these neat new \nmassage moves you've learned actually are \nthe massage itself. But you'd be wrong! Oh yes, very wrong. \nMassage moves are not the massage; they're just the medium. \nLet me give you an analogy to help explain this: \nLearning massage is like learning to play a musical instrument. The moves in \nthis chapter are the \nnotes on the scale, plus some basic chords and combina-\ntions. They're great ways to warm up your fingers and make some \nrudimentary noises, but if you continue to play them over and over again, \nyou're going to drive the people close to you crazy. \nIn massage, you have to go beyond the moves pretty quickly. You need to \ndevelop a \"moveless \nmovement,\" or \"flow,\" in which you're concentrating not \non your own technique, but on your partner's feelings, her sensations, and \nher reactions, just like a \nmusician who forgets all about notes and scales, \nsharps and flats, and even the instrument itself. Your movements are the \ntechnique, the body you \nmassage is the instrument, and it's the interaction \nbetween the two that makes the music. \nEFTA00008175\n\n130 Part \nIII: \nThe Art \nof \nGiving Massage \nMassage is the music, the \ncommunication, the \nthing that you create, \nNOT the \nmovements required to produce the \nsensations. \nWhoa! \nGetting a little deep here, aren't \nwe? Sorry about that. Don't \nworry—\nthe \nrest of this chapter's \ngoing to be very practical \nand concrete. After all,\nyou still \nhave to learn your scales before \nyou can play Carnegie Hall. \nDon't Do \nIt, Mon! \nJust like the Jamaican \nbobsled team, you may be all fired up to go out and \npractice your new moves. Before you jump off \nthe cliff and begin massaging \naway recklessly on \nanybody who lets you near them, \nhowever, stop for a \nmoment to consider \nsome sage words of advice about: \n3 Conditions that you should NOT treat \n3 Places you should AVOID touching \n3 Moves you should NOT make \nContraindications \nAs innocuous as massage may seem, \nthere are still times when you should \nrefrain from giving \none because it may adversely \naffect a health condition of \nthe person who \nreceives it. Contraindications is the medical term for these \nconditions, a word which, when you look \nat it closely, obviously means \n\"Nicaraguan \nrebel indications.\" No, really, \n\"contra\" means against, as in con-\ntrary, and indications are \nthings that tell you what to do one way or the other. \nSo contraindications are things that are telling you not to do \nsomething. \nThe \nlist of contraindications for massage may \nbe longer than you expect, and \nit includes some \nconditions that at first glance don't seem like massage \nwould affect at all. Take a look: \n3 Fever. When you have a fever, your body is \ntrying to isolate and expel an \ninvader of some kind. Massage increases overall circulation and could \ntherefore work against your body's natural defenses. \n3 Inflammation: Massage can further irritate an area of \ninflammation, so \nyou should not administer It. \nInflamed conditions include anything \nthat \nends in -ids, such as phlebitis \n(inflammation of a vein), dermatitis \n(inflammation of the skin), arthritis (inflammation of the Joints), and so \non. In the case of localized problems, you can still massage around \nthem, however, avoiding the \ninflammation itself. \nEFTA00008176\n\n \nChapter \n10: \nAll \nthe \nRight \nMoves \n131 \n3 \nHigh \nblood \npressure: \nHigh \nblood \npressure \nmeans \nexcessive \npressure \nagainst \nblood \nvessel \nwalls. \nMassage \naffects \nthe \nblood \nvessels, \nand \nso \npeople \nwith \nhigh \nblood \npressure \nor \na \nheart \ncondition \nshould \nreceive \nlight, \nsedating \nmassages, \nIf \nat \nall. \n3 \nInfectious \n&sews: \nMassage \nis \nnot \na \ngood \nidea \nfor \nsomeone \ncoming \ndown \nwith \nthe \nflu \nor \ndiphtheria, \nfor \nexample, \nand \nto \nmake \nmatters \nworse, \nyou \nexpose \nyourself \nto \nthe \nvirus \nas \nwell. \n3 \nHernia: \nHernias \nare \nprotrusions \nof \npart \nof \nan \norgan \n(such \nas \nthe \nintestines) \nthrough \na \nmuscular \nwall. \nIt's \nnot \na \ngood \nidea \nto \ntry \nand \npush \nthese \norgans \nback \ninside. \nSurgery \nworks \nbetter. \n3 \nOsteoporosis: \nElderly \npeople \nwith \na \nsevere \nstoop \nto \nthe \nshoulders \noften \nhave \nthis \ncondition, \nin \nwhich \nbones \nbecome \nporous, \nbrittle, \nand \nfragile. \nMassage \nmay \nbe \ntoo \nintense \nfor \nthis \ncondition. \n3 \nVaricose \nveins: \nMassage \ndirectly \nover \nvaricose \nveins \ncan \nworsen \nthe \nproblem. \nHowever, \nif \nyou \napply \na \nvery \nlight \nmassage \nnext \nto \nthe \nprob-\nlem, \nalways \nin \na \ndirection \ntoward \nthe \nheart, \nit \ncan \nbe \nvery \nbeneficial. \n3 \nBroken \nbones: \nStay \naway \nfrom \nan \narea \nof \nmending \nbones. \nA \nlittle \nlight \nmassage \nto \nthe \nsurrounding \nareas, \nthough, \ncan \nimprove \ncirculation \nand \nbe \nquite \nhelpful. \n3 \nSkin \nproblems: \nYou \nshould \navoid \nanything \nthat \nlooks \nlike \nIt \nshouldn't \nbe \nthere, \nsuch \nas \nrashes, \nwounds, \nbruises, \nburns, \nboils, \nand \nblisters, \nfor \nexample. \nUsually \nthese \nproblems \nare \nlocal, \nso \nyou \ncan \nstill \nmassage \nin \nother \nareas \n3 \nCancer: \nCancer \ncan \nspread \nthrough \nthe \nlymphatic \nsystem, \nand \nbecause \nmassage \nincreases \nlymphatic \ncirculation, \nit \nmay \npotentially \nspread \nthe \ndisease \nas \nwell. \nSimple, \ncaring \ntouch \nis \nfine, \nbut \nmassage \nstrokes \nthat \nstimulate \ncirculation \nare \nnot. \nAlways \ncheck \nwith \na \ndoctor \nfirst. \n3 \nOther \nconditions \nand \ndiseases: \nDiabetes, \nasthma, \nand \nother \nserious \nconditions \neach \nhave \ntheir \nown \nprecautions, \nand \nyou \nshould \nget \na \ndoctor's \nOK \nbefore \nadministering \nmassage. \n3 \nHIV \ninfection: \nSome \npeople \nstill \nthink \nof \nAIDS \nas \nsomething \nthat \ncan \nbe \n\"caught\" \nthrough \nsimple \nskin\n-to\n-skin \ncontact, \nbut \nmost \nof \nus \nknow \nthat's \nnot \nthe \ncase. \nIf \nthere \nis \nno \nexchange \nof \nbodily \nfluids \n(blood, \nsemen, \nvagi-\nnal \nfluids, \nor \nmother's \nmilk), \nHIV \ncan't \nbe \ntransmitted \nduring \nmassage. \nSo, \nHIV \ninfection \nis \nnot \ncontraindicated \nfor \nthis \nreason. \nHowever, \nsome \nof \nthe \ninfections \nthat \npeople \nsuffering \nfrom \nthe \nlater \nstages \nof \nAIDS \nexpe-\nrience \nare \ncontraindicated, \nand \nyou \nshould \navoid \nthose \ninfections. \nLoving, \nsoothing \ncontact \nis \nextremely \nimportant \nfor \npeople \nat \nany \nstage \nof \ninfection, \nbut \nin \nthe \ncase \nof \nany \nvisible \nrashes, \nsores, \nlesions, \nor \nswelling, \nmassage \nis \nbest \nleft \nto \na \nprofessional. \nIf \nyou \nhave \nany \ncuts \nor \nscrapes \nor \nscratches \non \nyour \nhands, \nit's \nan \nespecially \ngood \nidea \nto \nwear \nthin \nsurgical \ngloves \nwhile \nmassaging \nan \nHiV-infected \nperson \nwith \nany \nsigns \nof \nopen \nlesions. \nEFTA00008177\n\n132 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage  \n0\n 3 \nPregnancy: Most women love to receive \nmassage during \npregnancy, and \nit's \nperfectly \nfine to give them \none, \nbut \nthere \nare a \nfew \nprecautions to \nobserve. \nSee the sidebar about \npregnancy \nlater in this chapter. \nJust a minute \nhere! All this makes It sound like \nyou practically have to get a \nmedical checkup and an \nOK from the doctor before giving \nsomeone a mas-\nsage, \ndoesn't it? Well, in many cases, that's \nexactly what it means. Always \nerr \non the side \nof \ncaution \nwhen \nyou're \nconsidering \ngiving a massage to a \nperson \nwith \nany health concerns. Check it \nout with his or her physician first. \nThe first and foremost rule here \nis, \"Do no harm.\" If you're not sure about a \nparticular condition, don't give the massage. \nBad \nmoves \n%NG/ \nEver \nwatch an infant pet a cat? They often have the best of \nintentions, but \nthey just can't seem to get it \nright. Wham! Wham! goes the beefy little \nhand \non top of \nthe cat's head, and the poor feline scurries \naway before the Infant \ndoes any serious damage. \nSimilarly, there are moves that you should \nnot \nmake during a massage, no matter \nhow good your Intentions are. They all \ncause discomfort, \nand some of them may even cause harm. \nPregnancy — a \ncontraindication? \nThere are some people who \nbelieve that \npregnant women should not receive massage. \nMost of these people, needless to \nsay, are not \npregnant \nwomen, whose backs and legs are \noftenquite sore, and who love \nmassage. There's \na section in Chapter 18 on this topic, but for now \nI want to put your mind \nat ease and say that it's \nperfectly okay to massage a pregnant \nwoman, \nas long as \nyou \nobserve a few \nsimple \nprecautiOns: \n3 \nAlways make sure her legs and head are \nsupported with \npillows. \n3 Never put her in a  face\n-down position to \nmassage \nher. In her last trimester, she \nshould lie only on her side. \n3 Only light gliding strokes should \nbe used \ndirectly on the \nabdomen. Don't press \ndirectly onto or knead in this area. \nao Always give soothing, relaxing \nmassage \nmoves, never \nheavy ordeep. \n3 Avoid the ankles \nand heels betause, \naccording to the theory of reflexology, \nthe \nheels contain \nspecial points that may stim-\nulate \nlabor. Going into labor \nduring a \nmassage is not \nrecommended. Chapter 14 \nhas more info and a  diagram \nshowing the \nlocation of these \nreflexology points. \nEFTA00008178\n\n \nChapter10: \nAll \nthe \nRight Moves 133 \n3 Neck pulling: \nDo not grasp the \nhead \nfirmly and pull \nupward, \nattempting \nto lengthen the neck (some people say this is what happened to Audrey \nHepburn). \n3 Neck twisting: Only a very gentle and slow turning of the neck to one \nside or the other is appropriate during massage. No sudden movements! \n3 \nNeck pulling and twisting together. Never ever, for any reason, pull and \ntwist the neck at the same \ntime. This can be very dangerous. \n3 Bone cracking: Never ever try to do a chiropractic\n-type \nadjustment if \nyou haven't been trained as a ... duh . .. chiropractor. \n3 \nBone pushing: Don't press directly on \nbones, \nespecially \nthe spine. \nInstead, glide lightly over these areas. \n3 Hyperextension: Basic stretches are okay, and f  explain several in \nChapters 11 and 16. \nHowever, don't try to hyperextend any joint past its \nnormal range-of-motion unless you receive some serious \nschooling in \nmassage. This is hard to \ndo with the knee or elbow, which resist such \nmaneuvers, but you can easily hyperextend the neck, for example, so \nyou need to use caution. \nDanger zones \n\"Endangerment sites\" are super-sensitive areas on the body. These areas con-\ntain important pieces of your anatomy, like nerves and \nblood supply, for \nexample, in exposed and vulnerable positions. Highly trained massage thera-\npists \ncan \nsometimes work In these \nareas, but if \nyou're \nnot a professional \nmassage ace yourself, it's better to stay away from the following spots: \n3 \nFront of the neck/throat You've heard of the expression, \"Go for the \njugular,\" right? Well, this is where you find it. Unless you're trying to \nchoke someone, it's a good idea to stay away from this area that also \ncontains the carotid artery and major nerves. \n3 \nSide of the neck: Not \nquite as sensitive as the front \nof the neck, \nyou \nshould still treat it delicately. \n3 The \"ear notch\": Just behind your jawbone and beneath your ear you \nfind a little notch. It's not a good idea to jam a finger into this notch, \nunless you're trying to extort money or favors from the person receiving \nthe massage, because it contains a sensitive facial nerve. \n3 \nThe eyeball: \nUnless you're trying to do a Three \nStooges \nmassage \n(popu-\nlar amongst college \nmales), don't poke your fingers directly into the \nperson's eyes. \n3 \nThe axilla: This is a fancy \nterm for the armpit \nwhich, as you \nknow, is a \nsensitive area, filled with nerves, arteries, and lymph glands. Not to men-\ntion, most people are very \nticklish there. \nEFTA00008179\n\n134 Part \nIII: The Art of Giving \nMassage  \n3 The \nupper \ninner arm: \nJust down from \nthe \narmpit, along the inside of the \nupper \narm, is a \nsensitive, \nnerve-filled \narea \nalong the \nlength of the \narm \nbone. Pressing here too firmly gives you that yucky-nervy feeling. \n3 The ulnar notch of the elbow: Otherwise known as the \"funny bone,\" \nthis spot contains the ulnar nerve which, \nif you touch it too hard, causes \nnormally discreet \npeople to curse in several languages. \n3 \nThe abdomen: Houdini was killed by an unsuspected punch to this \narea, \nwhich is filled with \nmany squishy important bits known as organs. Be \nespecially gentle around the upper abdomen along the ribs, where you \nfind the liver, gall bladder, and spleen. \n3 The lower back: Just to both sides of the \nspine, and below the ribs, is \nwhere you find the \nkidneys. Don't press too hard here or \npound on \nthem. Kidneys don't like it when you do \nthat. \n3 The femoral triangle: Not \nto be confused with the Bermuda triangle, \nthis area is often referred to as the \"groin.\" \nIt's the inner part of the line \nin front where your leg \nmeets your body. If you press too hard here, you \ncan actually cut off circulation to \nthe leg. \n3 \nPopliteal area Popularly known as the \nback of the knee, you should \nalways treat this \nspot gingerly. It's very \nsensitive to pressure. \nPlease don't do that \nThe ultimate \ncontraindication Is a request from the \nperson receiving the mas-\nsage that you stop doing \nwhat you're doing. Immediately. Quit it. No \nmore! \nWhen a person says, \"Please don't do that,\" then don't do that. \nThis is espe-\ncially true for well-meaning \nbeginners, who have a tendency to press ever \nforward with \ntheir newfound massage skills, in spite \nof the complaints issuing \nforth from the poor soul beneath \ntheir fingers. \nThe following Is \nNOT proper etiquette: \nMassage partner: \"It really hurts!\" \nYou: \n\"Oh no, it doesn't. That's just your tension \nmelting away. Visualize your \nmuscles as butter ....\" \nIn massage, \nmore than any other business, the \ncustomer is always right. But \nthere are times when the \nperson receiving the massage either doesn't \nknow \nor \nwon't tell you he's uncomfortable. How do you know \nwhat to do then? \nThat's where body language clues come in. \nEFTA00008180\n\n \nChapter \n10: All the \nRight Moves 735\nBody language clues \nSome people think that when they're getting a massage they have to \"grin \nand bear it\" when something hurts. They figure \nmassage is like a form of tor-\nture, and they're prisoners of war. They certainly aren't going to display any \nsigns of \nweakness or let you know you're hurting them. Other people may not \neven know \nthey're uncomfortable, \nbecause their discomfort is \nunconscious, \nand so \nthey can't communicate it to you. \nIn these cases, wise massage givers have figured out certain non-verbal clues \nthat they can use to determine when their massage Is too strong. These Include: \n3 Curling of the toes \n3 Arching the back \n3 Inability to \nspeak in a normal tone \n3 Facial \ngrimaces and contortions \n3 \nExcess sweating, especially in a cool room \nSo, what should you do when your partner starts showing signs of discom-\nfort? The answer is simple — talk about it. Simple, straightforward \ncommunication \nclears up most \nsituations \nimmediately. Some \npeople just \nwon't be able to believe that you honestly want them to tell you how they \nfeel. Go ahead, surprise them. \nThe one word \nnever to say when \nyou're giving a massage \nYou can get away with almost any kind of ama-\nteur commentary while giving \na  massage to \nfriends and family because, after all, they under-\nstand that you're an amateur. Thus, when you \nsay, \"Geez, am I  pressing too hard there?\" \nthey're likelyto respond with some \npositive crit-\nicism. However, there is one particular word \nthat neither amateurs nor professionals should \never utter \nwhile in the middle of giving a mas-\nsage. Hearing it  strikes fear into \nthe poor \nvulnerable \nperson lying there receiving. And \nthat word \nis ... \n\"oops.\" \nLike a surgeon saying \"oops\" in the middle of an \noperation, or a pilot saying \"oops\" while \nmaking \nthe approach for landing, your saying \"oops\" in \nthe middle of a massage, although \nhopefully not \nlife-threatening, simply doesn't inspire \nconfi-\ndence. It may lead some people to imagine \nhorrible \nscenarios — injured muscles, crushed \narteries, or indelible marks left on the skin. \nThe person receiving doesn't know \nwhat kind of \nmassage move you're attempting to perform at \nany given moment So, if you don't get the move \nexactly right each time, don't worry; she's not \ngoing to know the \ndifference. Not unless you \nsay \"oops,\" that is. \nEFTA00008181\n\n136 \nPart III: The Art of \nGiving Massage \nBuilding \nYour Massage \nMuscles \nMassage \nrequires the sustained \ndexterous use of \ncertain muscles in your \nhands, \nforearms, shoulders, and in fact \nyour entire body. You may not \nbe \nusing these muscles for \nany particular purpose right \nnow. Like any other \nmuscles \nthat come suddenly into use, \nthey may get sore when you \nbegin \nusing them. Don't be \nalarmed, as this is natural. \nHere's a list of a few \nexercises and devices that \nmassage pros sometimes use \nto help \nbuild massage muscles: \n3 \"Walking\" a quarter. Balance \na quarter on your \nthumb. By using only \nthe one hand, try to \nturn it over onto the \ntop of your index finger. \nIf you \nsucceed, \nthen try to flip it \nover onto your \nmiddle finger, and so \non. When \nyou get \ngood, you can walk the \nquarter over all four \nfingers and catch it \nwith the thumb \nagain from \nbelow. \n3 Finger \ndancing: First, hold your hand \nin front of your face, with \nyour \npalm facing away \nfrom you. Keeping your thumb out \nof the way, hold all \nfour fingers loosely together. This is \nthe starting position. Next, separate \nyour fingers down the \nmiddle, two on each side. \nThis position is shown \nin \nFigure 10-1. Finally, bring those \nfingers back together \nagain, and then \ntake just the \npinkie finger and index \nfinger away from the center. \nThis \nposition is also shown in \nFigure 10-1. Practice until \nyou can repeat these \nsteps over and \nover in a \ncontinuous loop. \n3 Fingertip \npushups: For you fitness \nfanatics, try doing some fingertip \npushups; \nthese not only strengthen \nyour fingers for \nmassage, but you \nreceive the \nadded benefit of some \npowerful exercise. Be \ncareful not to \noverdo it, and always \ncheck with a physician \nbefore starting a new \nexer-\ncise \nregime. \n3 \nGrape squeezing: In order to \nsensitize your fingers for \ndelicate massage \nmoves, you \ncan practice squishing \ngrapes. Simply place a grape \nbetween \nyour \nthumb and your first two \nfingers and squeeze till you \nburst the \nskin. Practice \nsqueezing new grapes until \nthey're just about to burst, \nmaintaining a constant \nsensitive level of pressure. \n3 \nLunges: Lunges strengthen \nyour legs and hips, making it \neasier for you \nto stand \nand bend and squat when you're \ngiving a massage. \n3 \nDance: Any \nkind of dance class is great to \nprepare you for using your \nwhole \nbody to do massage. \n3 \nYoga: \nYou won't believe how \nquickly you get tight and \ntired just from \ngiving a simple \nmassage. Doing yoga may help \nkeep you limber. \n3 Fist squeezing: You can \npick up a little stress-relief \nsqueeze ball Just \nabout anywhere \nthese days, even at the \ncheckout counter in most \ndrug-\nstores. These are great not \nonly for relieving stress, but \nfor building \nEFTA00008182\n\n Chapter 10: All the Right \nMoves 737 \nhand muscles, too. There's even a \nspecial compound made just for this \npurpose, called \"power putty,\" \nthat is sold in massage stores. \nPo Dumbbells: Lighter weight dumbbells (5-12 pounds) are great for build-\ning muscles \nin the forearms and wrists. \nSimply sit on a \nbench with the \ndumbbell in one hand, support your forearm across the top of your leg, \npalm up, then curl and extend the forearm. \nFigure 10-1: \nThis simple \nfinger \nexercise is \nharder than \nit looks, and \nit's great for \nbudding hand \nstrength and \ncoordination. \nYou Got 'eta Moves \nSo, what do you actually do when you place your hands on a body and start \ngiving a massage? Well, the first thing many people do is panic. They stand \nthere with their hands motionless on an arm or a leg or a back, and they \nthink to themselves, \"Oh my \ngosh, what do I do now?\" \nThis is where the seven types of massage moves you find in this section \ncome in handy. After practicing them, you can rest easy that you won't draw \na blank when it \ncomes time to give a massage. \nEFTA00008183\n\n138 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage \n_et  \nVitt \nFeeling versus \ndoing \nMassage is as much (or morel \nabout feeling as \nit is about doing. In fact, without really doing \nanything, you can still give a  good massage. \nThrough simple touch alone, you can have a \nprofound effect on somebody else. \nWhen I was in massage school, during the very \nfirst day in class, the instructor had us do a little \nexperiment, which you can try for yourself. \nHave your partner sit barefoot in front of you. \nGently \ngrasp one of her feet in your hands, and \nthen DON'T DO ANYTHING. Just feel.-Feel her \nfoot, the weight of it in \nyour hands, the contours \nof it against your fi\nngers and palms, its warmth, \nthe pulse of \nthe blood. Resist \nany temptation to \nsqueeze or \npress or knead. \nAfter just five or \nten minutes, slowly pull your \nhands away and ask your partner to note the \nfeeling in both of \nher feet. Almost everyone \nnotices a  large difference; the \ntouched foot \nfeels as thoughit's been vigorously massaged. \nIt's tingling and alive. \nAll you had to do to achieve that effect was to \nfeel. No need to do anything at all. \nThe seven \nbasic categories of \nmovements are: \n3 Gliding \n3 \nPressing \n3 Kneading \n3 Rubbing \n3 Shaking \n3 Tapping \n3 Stretching \nSlip-sliding \naway: The pleasures of \ngliding \nUsually the first move you make on \nany particular part of the body is \ngliding. \nWhy glide first, you say? Why not Just get right to the pressing and \nmuscle-\nsqueezing part of the massage? Three reasons: \n3 Gliding is a great way to \nwarm up the skin and underlying muscles while \nsimultaneously spreading your oil or massage cream. \n3 You cover a lot of territory during a glide, too, so it's perfect for \"Intro-\nducing\" your hands to your partner. \n3 \nYou'll get a feel for your partner's body and discover \nwhich areas may \nneed the most \nattention during the rest of the massage. \nEFTA00008184\n\n Chapter \n10: \nAll the \nRight \nMoves 139 \nFigure 10-2: \nLong, \nsoft, \nlight gliding \n(top); sliding-\ndown\n-the-\nbanister \ngliding \n(middle); \nsqueezing-\ntoothpaste-\nthrough-a-\ntube gliding \n(bottom). \nDepending upon \nthe amount of pressure you use, a glide can be light and \nethereal or \ndownright intense. Usually, at the \nbeginning of a massage, you \nwant to start with lighter gliding and \nthen progress to the more heavy-duty \nstuff later, after your partner trusts your touch. \nTake a look at Figure 10-2. These \npictures make gliding look easy, right? What \ncould be \nsimpler than just running your hands \nalong someone's skin? It's a \nlittle trickier than that, \nthough. Good gliding is something you learn over \ntime, \nwith practice. \nAit \nEFTA00008185\n\n140 \nPart III: The Art of Giving \nMassage \nHere are three basic types of \ngliding: \n3 \nLong, soft, light: You \ncan create the lightest type of \ngliding by just barely \nbrushing the fingertips or palms across the \nskin in a feather-light fash-\nion. \nThis type of movement is also known as a nerve-stroke \nbecause it \ncalms the nerves. \n3 Sliding down the banister: \nThis movement follows the contours of the \nbody more \nclosely. As you glide, you mold your \nhands to fit the body, \njust like a little kid who molds himself to fit over the banister as he \nslides down it Into the foyer. This is typical gliding, the type you use to \nspread oil, warm \nthe body, and so on. \n3 \nSqueezing toothpaste through a tube: This is intense gliding or gliding \nwith an \nattitude. When you try it on your partner for the first time, you \nmay get a stunned reaction. You achieve this by wrapping your hands \naround a leg \nor an arm and squeezing firmly while you glide, as if you \nwere trying to squeeze toothpaste from a giant tube. The most typical \nplaces for this maneuver are on the calf and the forearm. \nStart out slowly, and always, always make the motions \ntoward the heart \nbecause you actually move blood through the veins with this move. \nWatch out for the contraindications of \nvaricose veins and phlebitis. \nGood places to \nglide \nYou can glide just \nabout anywhere there's an expanse of skin to move over. \nTight little nooks and crannies, like between the toes for example, are not \ngood places to glide because there's not enough open \nterritory. However, you \ncan still glide on smaller surfaces, even over the \neyelids (provided your part-\nner is not wearing contact lenses). Simply adjust your hands to the area you \nare touching. Thus, a forehead glide would \ninclude Just your fingertips, while \na glide to the leg would include your \nwhole palm. \nFor all types of gliding, you need to turn your hands into super-sensitive, \nmicro-adjusting instruments that constantly change to conform to each and \nevery \nlittle hill and valley on your partner's body. Imagine yourself trying to \nsmooth out a sheet of plastic-wrap around an Irregularly shaped piece of \nfruit, allowing \nno air-pockets or wrinkles. Got it? \n\"A\"\" marks the spot: Pressing \n\"Out, damned spot!\"— Shakespeare \nGreat poets throughout the ages have understood the value of getting rid \nof \nspots. And it's no wonder. If you've ever received a back rub from someone \nand suddenly felt them \npress exactly \nthe \nright spot, you \nknow the sensation \nis swift and \nunmistakable. Immediately, you say something like, \"Yes, there it \nis. That's the spot!\" \nEFTA00008186\n\n Chapter \n10: All \nthe \nRight \nMoves 141\nSo, what is the \"spot\" anyway? \nMassage pros have all kinds of fancy names \nfor it, like \"trigger points,\" or muscle spasms, or adhesions. Whatever you \ncall them, these points of tension or pain are what we're trying to get rid of in \nmassage, and pressing on them skillfully can help achieve that. \nI envision these spots as tenacious little \ncriminals who invade our bodies and \ntake some of our muscles hostage. They're tough, resourceful, and they \nthrive best when we don't know exactly where to find them. Massage helps \nus locate where our tension spots \nare hiding so we can ferret them out. Just \nthe right amount of pressure can send them this message: \n\"It's no use. We know you're in there. Come out with \nyour hands up. Let the \nhostages go, and you'll get off easy\" \nOf course, if the \"spots\" don't leave your muscles alone, you have to go in \nwith some heavy firepower. That's where pressing comes in. Here are a few \nsteps you can follow to find \nspots and press them into submission: \n3 Zeroing in: First, while you're warming the tissues up during your pre-\nliminary gliding strokes, feel for \nareas that are unusually tight, hard, or \nsensitive. (See the \"Under pressure\" sidebar in \nChapter 8.) After you're \ndone \ngliding over a certain area, come back to these targeted spots one \nat a time and zero in on them by using Just your fingertips or thumbs. \n3 \nPushing the walk button: You know those little rubberized buttons that \nyou push to change the light to green at \nintersections? They give a little \nat first, but then you get the feeling that you have to push harder. \nYou \ncan't quite tell if you're holding it down or not, so you hold it in firmly \nfor a few seconds, much longer than you'd hold, say, the on/off switch \non a desk lamp. Well, that's the same kind of \npressing you can use in \nyour massage — \ngood, firm, sustained pressure is what makes \npressing \nwork, as shown in Figure 10-3. \n3 Pinpoint.pressure: You not only need the right spot; you need the \nEXACT right spot. Thls can mean an Itty-bitty micro-difference in \nthe \nlocation of your fingers or thumb. Keep \nfeeling around until you can tell \nyou're \ndirectly on \"top\" of the spot. Usually this feels like you could \neasily slip \noff of it on either side. \n3 \nKeep adjusting: M you feel your \npartner's body respond, you can \nadjust your pressure accordingly, lightening your pressure as the tension \ndissipates. \nGood \nplaces \nto press \nFinding the right \nspots to press may sometimes feel a little tricky to you. \nAfter all, the body has about a million different points on \nit. How do you tell \nwhere's a \ngood place to apply pressure and where's not a good place? There \nare two answers: \nEFTA00008187\n\n142 Part \nIII: \nThe Art of \nGiving \nMassage \n3 \nYou have to practice feeling for these points (this is the art of palpation, \nwhich you find \nout about In Chapter 4). \n3 Certain points are common to most people. After you practice on several \nwilling massage partners, you'll build \nyour skill in locating them. \nFigure 10-3: \nFinger \npressing \n(top) and \nthumb \npressing \n(bottom). \nis \nW. \nWI \nThe spots we are talking about in this \nsection are not shiatsu points or acu-\npressure points, which are \nspots along energy pathways in the \nbody. You \nget to know a few shiatsu points In Chapter 11; the spots we're talking \nabout here are occasionally \nfound in the same areas, but they're a different \nanimal altogether. \nLet's do the \ntwist: kneading \nAfter you master the art \nof kneading, you may be in \ngreat demand because \nkneading, in my opinion, produces \nthe most pleasurable sensations of all \nthe \nmaneuvers. It gets in \ndeep to flush out tension while at the same \ntime stimu-\nlating a large \nsurface area on \nthe skin. \nEFTA00008188\n\n \nChapter 10: \nAll \nthe \nRight \nMoves \n143 \nYour kneading \ntechnique can make or \nbreak you as a \nmassage giver, so I recom-\nmend \npracticing quite a bit on \nthis one. If you practice \nbuilding your massage \nmuscles, as suggested earlier \nin this chapter, you can be \na better kneader \nbecause this \nparticular maneuver requires a \nlot of strength in the \nhands. \nIn order to \nknead effectively, you \nmust banish fear! The \nbiggest mistake \nnovice kneaders make is \nkneading too tentatively. \nAs a massage teacher, \nI've \nspent hundreds of \nhours hunched \nover students \nguiding their hands into \nbigger movements. \n\"Get more flesh \nbetween those fingers!\" I \ncajole them. \n\"Twist your arms around \nsome more. Use your \nwhole body to make the \nmovement.\" \nThis is good \nadvice for you, too. A \nwimpy knead is much \nworse than no \nknead at all. Here are some \nways to make your \nkneading big, bold, and \nbeloved by all who \nencounter it: \n3 \nCome on everybody, let's \ndo the Twist: Chubby \nChecker would have \nbeen disappointed if \nhe \nlooked• \nout on \nthe dance floor to find \ndozens of \npeople just \nstanding there \nand sort of \nhalf-heartedly bending \na little at \nthe waist. \nWhen he said twist, \nhe meant Twist!, as in \ntwist-tie and twist-\noff-top and wow-look\n-at-that-twister-about\n-to-destroy-the\n-barn! The \nnumber \none rule for kneading \nis to use your whole \nbody to create a \ntwisting \nmovement around the area \nyou're working on. \nSee Figure 10-4, \nwhich shows how your \nhands can move around a \nthigh in a circular \nwringing \nmotion. \n3 Baker making \nbread: Of course, when \nwe think of \nkneading, the image \nof a baker \noften comes to \nmind, with his \nhands wrist-deep in \npliable \nflour, constantly \nsqueezing, rolling, \nand pushing. In \nfact, those are the \nthree components of a \nsuccessful knead. After \nyou have twisting \ndown, \nadd these steps to \ncomplete the \npicture: \n• \nSqueezing: During your twist, \nthe hand that's \nfurthest away (the \nright hand as \nshown in Figure \n10-5a) is squeezing in \nas much flesh \nas possible between the \nfingers and palms. \n• \nRolling: The right hand \nrolls the squeezed flesh \nback toward you \nwhile the near hand \nbegins its journey \naway from you, \npushing \nmore flesh \ninto the fold, as \nshown in Figure 10-5b. \n•  Pushing: \nFinally, you're in the \nposition shown in \nFigure 10-5c, and \nyour \nright hand starts \npushing while your \nleft hand takes \nover the \nsqueezing and rolling. \n3 Pinching and \nrolling: This final \ntype of kneading is \noften called skin \nrolling. It's reserved for \nareas that normally \ndon't respond too well to \nbigger twisting, \nsqueezing, and rolling \nmaneuvers. it's a \nlittle tricky to \ndo, but \nmost people love the \nway it feels. First, \npinch a roll of flesh \nbetween your thumb \nand the first two \nfingers. Then, \nkeeping your \nthumb locked \nin position, glide \nyour whole hand \nover the skin while \n\"walking\" your first two \nfingers forward so that \nthey push a constant roll \nof skin back \nagainst your thumb as \nshown in Figure \n10-5d. \nEFTA00008189\n\n744 Part III: The Art of Giving \nMassage  \nFigure 10-4: \nNotice how \nyour hands, \narms, \nshoul-\nders, and \nentire body \nmove \naround the \narea you are \nkneading. \nFigure \n10-5: \nSqueez-\ning (a), \nrolling (b), \npushing (c), \nand pinch-\ning \nand \nrolling \n(dl. \nGood \nplaces to knead \nBy definition, to knead something \nmeans you have to grasp it between \nyour \nfingers or \npalms. Therefore, areas of the body \nthat you can't grasp, you \ncan't \nknead. It's simple: no \nflesh, no knead. That's why it's \ntrickier to knead skinny \npeople \nthan to knead fleshy people. That's \nwhy it's trickier to knead a knee \nthan to knead a thigh. That \ndoesn't mean you need to knead a whole \nhandful \nEFTA00008190\n\n Chapter \n10: All the Right Moves 1\n45 \nof flesh \nto get the Job done, though. You \ncan perform the last type of knead-\ning, skin rolling, even on areas with \nalmost no fat, like a supermodel's \nupper \nback, for instance. \nWar on, war off: \nRubbing \nThe secret to successful rubbing, or friction as \nmassage pros call it, is to \nmake the pressure from \nyour fingers or palms strong enough \nto stay station-\nary on the surface of the skin \nwhile moving the layers \nbelow.. \nIn other \nwords, \nyour fingers don't glide while they rub, although \nthey can definitely move \naround quite a bit. Take, for \nexample, the maneuvers you receive on \nyour \nhead when you get a \nshampoo at a salon. A good \nshampoo person employs \nfriction techniques, \nholding her fingers steady on a certain part of your \nscalp \nwhile manipulating your head beneath it. If she simply \nglides her fingers \nacross your scalp, the sensation is disturbingly \ninadequate. \nMother analogy for \nrubbing is waxing your car. You take a buffing \npad in one \nhand and you rub the wax on. Then with \na rag in the other hand, you rub the \nwax off. Your fingers \nare never in contact with the car \nitself, but the car \nreceives the effects, not the buffing \npad or rags. So It is with massage. \nYour \nfingers are in contact with the skin, but you're affecting the layers \nbelow. \nHere are a few \nrubbing techniques that work well \nfor various parts of the body: \n3 Miser's rub: Especially good for the \nfingers and toes, the miser's rub will \nremind you of someone \nrubbing a gold coin between \ntheir fingers, as \nshown in Figure 10-6a. \n3 Circular \nMaking sure your fingers are planted \nsecurely, move the skin \nover the tissues below it in \nsmall circles, as shown in Figure 10-6b. You \ncan move your hand gradually along the skin's \nsurface, creating a series \nof circles over an entire area. \nNAM? \n3 \nCross fiber. In any given \narea of the body, the muscle \nfibers are running \npredominantly in one direction or \nanother. On the inside of your upper \narm, for instance, the biceps \nmuscle runs from your shoulder to \nyour \nelbow, up and down. If  you rub in a cross-wise \ndirection over these \nfibers, from the inside of your arm \nto the outside, you're making a \ncross-\nfiber movement, as \nshown in Figure 10-6c. This \naction is especially good \nfor people who exercise a \nlot or are in the later stages of recovering \nfrom \nan injury because it promotes the repair of scar tissues. \nGood places to rub \nYou can rub most \neverywhere, but you have to be careful in \nsensitive areas \nbecause rubbing can \nbe a little annoying if it's done, \nsay, on the eyelids. \nEFTA00008191\n\n766 Part \nThe Art of Giving Massage  \nFigure 104: \nThe \nmiser's \nrub (a), the \ncircular rub \n(b), and the \ncross-fiber \nrub \n(c). \nShake, rattle, and \nroll: Shaking \nSome people are afraid to get too \"physical\" \nwhen they give a massage, which \ndoesn't make much \nsense when you think about it. They Incorrectly assume \nthat every \nmassage move has to be as smooth \nand soothing as the next CD \nfrom Enya. But this is not true. \nSome of the best moves actually \njostle you \naround quite a bit. \nYou have to imagine \nwhat the shaking is actually doing \ninternally to the mus-\ncles, tendons, and bones where they attach \nto each other inside the body. It's \nlike loosening fruit from a tree. \nImagine that you're standing on the ground in \nfront of an apple \ntree, and one big perfect juicy \napple is still left just barely \nclinging to a high branch. Grasping a \nlower limb, you shake with the \nintention \nof loosening something \nat a distance from you. This is \nthe essence of shaking \nin massage, \ntoo. \nOf course, you \ndon't want to literally loosen \nmuscles from bone so that they \nfall \noff, but you do want to help \nease the muscles' tight grip of \nchronic ten-\nsion, especially \nin the joints. Shaking is great \nfor this, and there's a fine art to \nit. \nHere are three different \nversions that you can \npractice: \nEFTA00008192\n\n \nChapter \n10: All the Right Moves 1\n47 \nVibration \nNo other massage move feels quite as \ndramatic as vibration. It's a show biz \nmove, a move with \npizzazz. But first of all, you have to figure \nout how to do it, \nwhich isn't that easy for most of us. Here are the steps \n(and see Figure 10-7): \n3 \nPlacing just your fingertips on the area to be vibrated (try the back, \nwhich is easiest to start with), stiffen all of your \njoints from your fingers \nall the way up to your shoulders. \n3 Try making your entire arm \ntremble as one unit, as if you were \nextremely \ncold \nand shivering \nuncontrollably. \n3 Pressing firmly, concentrate all \nof that trembling down into your \nfingertips. \n3 \nSimultaneously, drag your fingertips slowly \ndown over your partner's \nback, \nremembering to imagine your movements loosening muscles all \nalong the way. \nFigure 10-7: \nCreating \nhigh speed \nvibration \ntakes con-\ncentration \nand a will-\ningness to \nlook spastic. \nBe careful not to vibrate a fingertip \ndirectly on top of the spine as you may \ncause some \ndiscomfort or bruising. \nShaking \nIn this move, you grasp one \npart of your partner's body (usually \na limb) and \nthen recreate the same kind of rigid \ntrembling you did for vibration. It can be \na \nslower trembling, though, even languid, but the intent is still to \nloosen deep \nmuscles. See Figure 10-8. \nEFTA00008193\n\n145 Part \nIII: \nThe Art of \nGiving \nMassage  \nFigure 10-8: \nShaking is \nsimilar to \nvibration, \nbut you \ngrasp \ninstead of \npress. \nRocking & rolling \nA doctor named Milton Trager developed a kind of massage called, appropri-\nately, Trager, which includes an awful lot of rocking and \nrolling, as shown In \nFigure 10-9. One of the results of a \nreally good Trager massage is a deep \nrelease of tension from areas that you wouldn't be able to get to with your fin-\ngers, like deep inside \nJoints. You can recreate some of the effects of this type \nof massage by doing \nsome very gentle rocking and rolling of your own. You \nfind out more about how to apply this to specific areas In the next chapter. \nFigure 10-t \nRocking and \nrolling pro-\nduces an \neffect on the \nsurrounding \nmuscles \nand \ndistant \njoints \nas \nwell. \nEFTA00008194\n\n \nChapter 10: All the Right Moves \n149 \nGood places to shake \nThe limbs respond \nexceptionally well to shaking. However, if you shake \nthe \nhead, you're \ncoming dangerously dose to a \nchiropractic maneuver, which Is a \ndefinite no-no. \nLarger areas such as the back and thighs respond well to \nvibration, and you \ncan rock the whole body, \nespecially when your partner is lying face \ndown. \nGet into the rhythm: Tapping \nThis is the type of \nmovement that you see movie actors \nperforming when \nthey think they're doing some really \nauthentic massage on-screen. It also \nseems to be the \npreferred move for overweight Russian men giving massages \nIn bathhouses. Yes, I'm talking about the famous karate\n-chop family of mas-\nsage maneuvers, otherwise \nknown as tapping. \nThis family of moves is based upon one major concept: getting pounded on \nfeels surprisingly good. This Is \ntrue, as long as you tap judiciously, with the \nright \namount of pressure. To achieve seasoned \ntapping prowess, practice \nwith the three \nbasic hand-shapes for tapping: the open fingertip, the karate \nhack, and the loose fist. All of them are done with \"soft\" \nhands because, after \nall, your intention is not to \nattack ninja-style but to increase \ncirculation and \nsoothe sore muscles. \nThe secret to all good tapping is \nthe rhythm. If you're not a natural born \ndrummer, try slowing your tapping down \nuntil you reach a rhythm that you \ncan sustain easily. It's not \nspeed that counts, but consistency. \n3 Fingertip tapping: This is the \nlightest tap, excellent for faces and the \ntop \nof your head. A lot of cosmetologists \nuse this move to bring extra \ncirculation to the cheeks, creating that \"rosy glow\" look. \nTapping \nis \nshown in Figure 10-10a. \n3 \nKarate hacking: Make sure to keep \nthe hands limp and not treat your \npartner's body like a \nboard you're trying to break. \nDon't hack directly \non bony areas, of course. Keep \nyour wrists loose and let the edges of \nyour flopping fingers do a lot of the hacking for you, as shown in \nFigure 10-10b. \n3 \nLoose fist pounding: You have to be extra careful \nwhen using your fists \nfor tapping, but they \ndefinitely come in handy if your \npartner is one of \nthose NFL linebacker types who doesn't \nseem to respond to normal mas-\nsage manipulations. Don't tighten your fists completely when tapping, \nand resist the temptation to do a Rocky-Balboa-side-of-beef-in-the-freezer \nmove. See Figure 10-10c. \nEFTA00008195\n\n750 Part \nIII: \nThe Art of \nGiving \nMassage  \nFigurate-Ilk \nFingertip \ntapping \n(a), \nkarate \nhack-\ning (b), and \nloose fist \npounding (c). \nGood places to tap \nTapping feels good Just about anywhere, but if you tap someone too hard on \nthe top of his head, he's likely to think you \nhave something against him. The \nusual rule is: the more \nflesh in an area, the more force you can tap \nwith, pro-\ngressing up the scale from fingertips to hacking hands to loose fists. Bony \nareas like the \nknees need light tapping with Just the fingertips. Also, go \nEFTA00008196\n\n Chapter 10: \nAll the Right Moves 151 \nfeather-light on the kidney area on either \nside of the spine in the lower back. \nCertain spots you may not think of, like the bottom of the feet for example, \nare great places to hack. And of course the ever-popular back, buttocks, and \nthighs are \ngreat places to practice \"getting into the rhythm.\" \nkeep it tone: Stretching \nStretching is really good for you, and a lot of people don't stretch as \nmuch as \nthey should In order to stay limber and youthful. You can help solve this \nproblem by incorporating a few stretching moves right into your massage. \nStretching feels really \ngood as long as \nyou follow three \neasy \nguidelines: \n3 Ease your partner Into it. \n3 \nEasy does It while you're doing it. \n3 Ease your partner out of it. \nRemember that each joint has a limit as to how far it will stretch in any and \nall possible directions, and this limit is called its range of motion. \nDon't try stretching any part of the body past its normal \nrange of motion \nbecause, if you do, it will hurt. A lot. Stop \nlong before you think you reach the \nmaximum stretch. Always ask your partner for feedback about how the \nstretch feels. Some people are super limber and you can twist them like pret-\nzels \nwhile others can take very little stretching before it \nbecomes \nuncomfortable. \nBe especially careful when stretching your partner's neck, moving \nit slowly \nand in only one plane at a time: left to right, up \nand down, or ear to shoulder. \nAnd don't hyperextend the neck, or any joint for that matter. (See the con-\ntraindications section earlier in this \nchapter.) \nThere are three basic types of stretches you can apply during a massage: \n3 Passive stretching: Passive stretching \ndoesn't mean you should have a \nho-hum attitude about the stretch. It means your partner just lies there \npassively and doesn't assist you at all while you stretch him, as shown \nin Figure 10-11. \n3 \nActive assisted stretching: This type of stretching, shown in Figure \n10-12, requires your partner to move through the \nstretch while you help \nher stretch a little further. It's not \nrecommended for lazy partners who \nJust want to lie back and have you do all the work during the massage. \nEFTA00008197\n\n152 Part \nIII: The Art of Giving. Massage \nyr Active resisted stretching: In this one, \nyour partner resists the move-\nment of the stretch that \nyou're giving him. When he stops \nresisting, you \nare able to \nstretch him even further. This \none's good for strengthening \nmuscles and can be \nconsidered a kind of mini-workout. \nFigure10-11: \nIn this pas-\nsive stretch \nof the knee \nand thigh, \nyou press \nthe \nperson's \nankle \ntoward her \nbuttock \nwhile she \njust lies \nthere letting \nit \nhappen. \nFigure 10.12 \nIn active \nassisted \nstretching, \nyou help \nyour partner \nstretch a \nlittle further. \nGood places to stretch \nThe multitude of joints in the body make it possible to do a large variety of \nJoint manipulations and stretches in many areas such as the toes, ankles, \nknees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands. You find out about a few \nall-time favorite stretches \nin the chapters to come. \nEFTA00008198\n\nChapter 10: All the Right Moves 153 \nMassage moves in a nutshell \nHere are some simple \ngeneral guidelines that you can apply to all the preced-\ning maneuvers and use in every massage you \ngive: \n3 Follow the contour. When \nin doubt about what particular move to \nmake, just trace the body's outlines with your fingers for a few moments, \napplying pressure according to what you feel. It's better to keep moving \nin a constant flow rather than stop and say something like, \"Now, what \nwas that next maneuver \nagain?\" This can be annoying to your partner. \n3 Do no harm: Don't press \ntoo hard or work on areas that may be too deli-\ncate, such as sprains, strains, or scar tissues soon after \ninjuries. Of \ncourse, \navoid all contraindicated areas and conditions. Ask for a physi-\ncian's advice if there is anything that gives you concern. \n3 Stay in the moment: The easiest way to look \nat a massage is piece by \npiece. Concentrate on one movement at a time, and one area. Work on \njust that leg first, and worry about what you're going to do on the arm \nlater. One move at a time, one after another, creates a whole massage. \nA ticklish situation \nSome people out there will flat-out refuse to \neven consider the possibility of \ngetting a mas-\nsage because they're afraid they would giggle \nso hard they would fall right off the \ntable. These \nfolks consider themselves \"ticklish,\" but what is \na ticklish person anyway? \nMost of us are sensi-\ntive when we \nget poked in the ribs or stroked \nlightly on the bottom of the feet, but some people \nclaim any kind of \ntouch at all elicits the \"tickle \nresponse.\" \nWhen someone complains of \nbeing overly tick-\nlish, you can follow \nthese steps to help them get \nover it: \n1.  First, explain that surface tension in the \nmuscles causes excessive ticklishness. \n2.  Explain that you are going to get \"under-\nneath\" this layer by \napplying firm pressure \nthat affects tissues below. \n3.  Gradually apply pressure with as broad a \nsurface as possible, for example, your \nentire palm instead of your fingers. \n4.  After you \"sink down- to a depth that is not \nticklish anymore, make your movements \nslow and steady, gently rocking back and \nforth, pulsing up and down. \nAvoid knead-\ning, pressing, and vibration. \n5.  Move slowly from one area to another, \nstaying away from the \nareas your partner \nreports as most seriously ticklish. \n6.  If your partner shows any signs of discom-\nfort, discontinue movement and simply \napply steady firm \npressure. \nEFTA00008199\n\n754 \nPart III: The Art of Giving Massage  \nThe \nMassage Dance \nSo, \nyou may be asking yourself, \nwhat am I  supposed to be \ndoing with the rest \nof my body \nwhile my hands are massaging \nsomeone? Good question. \nCan you \nguess the right answer? \nA. It doesn't matter, \nas long as you remain in a generally upright \nposition \nand don't fall asleep. \nB. Something constructive, such as learning a \nforeign language with audio-\ncassettes, \nbecause \notherwise you're \njust \nwasting your \ntime. \nC. Absolutely nothing; \nstay as stiff and still as possible so you don't dis-\ntract the person \nyou are massaging. \nD. Make every move a \"whole body move\" \nby engaging your entire self In \nwhat you're doing, turning the massage into a dance. \nThe answer, of \ncourse, is \"D.\" In fact, it's so important to use \nyour entire body \nproperly while giving a \nmassage that massage pros have given this practice a \nname — body mechanics. \nIt may \nseem like a lot of extra effort at first, \nbut in the long run It's easier If \nyou use proper \nbody mechanics and engage your entire body \nwhile giving a \nmassage rather than relying on the \nstrength of your arms and shoulders \nalone. \nActually, using your arms and \nshoulders alone is guaranteed to burn \nyou out really \nquickly. You may end up saying something like \"This is \nWAY \ntoo difficult.\" Then you may quit, offering muscle-fatigue as an excuse to your \npartner after Just ten minutes. \nHere are a few guidelines to help you fine-tune your body mechanics: \nr 3 Root \nyourself•. \nYour \nmovements should feel like they're coming from the \nplace where your body Is rooted to the earth. Don't get off balance and \nlose your center of power. You need to \nground yourself enough so that \nIt's difficult to \nknock you over when you're giving a massage. \n3 \nMove from below: \nWhether you're \nstanding \nor \nkneeling down next to \nyour partner to give the \nmassage, generate your movements from your \nlegs and hips, not Just your upper body, as shown in Figure 10-13. \n3 \nMaintain straight lines: When you apply pressure, do it in a straight line \nfrom your shoulders down to your \nfingertips. Bending your joints and \nthen applying pressure \nputs extra pressure on your thumbs, wrists, and \nelbows, and should be \navoided. Figure 10-14 shows you what I'm talking \nabout. \nEFTA00008200\n\n Chapter 10: All the Right Moves \n155 \nFigure 10-13: \nIf you're \nstanding, \nkeep your \nknees soft \nand move \nfrom your \nhips. If \nyou're \nkneeling, \nstill move \nfrom your \nhips. \nFigure 10-14: \nThe wrong \nway \n(top) \nand the \nright \nway \n(bottom) to \napply \npressure. \nEFTA00008201\n\n156 Part III: The Art of Giving \nMassage  \n3 Be kind to your thumbs and \nwrists: Thumbs take the biggest beating \nwhen giving a massage, and wrists \ncome in a close second. Be extra \ncareful not to rely only on these delicate instruments to do your heavy-\nduty massage work. Give them a break every once in a while by \nusing \nyour knuckles and forearms. \n3 \nLean a lot: Instead of straining your muscles to get the job done, use \nyour body weight. Simply LEAN on the person you're massaging by plac-\ning \nyour center of gravity several Inches away from her, then falling \nforward and supporting yourself on her body. This takes a little practice \nbecause our civilized instincts tell us not to use other people's bodies as \ncounter tops. Go ahead and try it, though. It saves you a lot of work. \nMassage \nGizmos \nEver wander around inside one of those \nexpensive gadget gift shops like the \nSharper \nImage and suddenly realize that about a quarter of the inventory is \nmassage gizmos of one kind or another? They have vibrating chairs, tables \nwith rollers built in, and devices to buzz you, press you, knead you, jab you, \nand squeeze you. Seeing all this, you \ncan definitely come to a couple very \nimportant \nconclusions: \nD\n3 \nMassage gizmos are a great way for manufacturers and retailers to make \nlots of money. \n3 \nMassage gizmos are a great way for you to spend lots of money. \nSo, naturally, the question comes to mind — are they worth it? In my opinion, \nmost of them are. And, fortunately, they don't all cost tons of money either. \nYou can get a nifty little massage device at your local pharmacy for $12.95. \nThere are three main reasons \nwhy people use massage gizmos: \n1. They're fun and kind of neat looking. \n2. They can help save your hands a lot of work. \n3. They actually make you feel better. \nOften, \npeople overlook reason number 3. This is strange, because that's the \nwhole point of using them, right? The little gizmos can really make you feel \nbetter, but you should also exercise the same cautions and observe the same \ncontraindications when using \nthem as you do when using your fingers. \nBefore you go out and purchase your own massage tool, I have a little \nsecret \nfor you, and you have to promise not to tell anyone else. Ready? Here it is: \nJUST ABOUT \nEVERYTHING FEELS GOOD WHEN IT'S RUBBED AGAINST YOUR \nBODY! THE SECRET IS NOT THE TOOL, BUT THE TOUCH. \nEFTA00008202\n\n \nChapter \n10: All the \nRight Moves 157 \nWhoops, I said that kind of loudly, didn't I? Maybe even some of the gizmo \nmakers heard. But it's \ntrue. Don't take my word for it. Go out in the backyard \nand grab a smooth, palm-sized rock. Wash it off, of \ncourse. Then have some-\none take a rounded end and gently rub it against your back \nmuscles. Wow! \nFeels fantastic, doesn't it? \nThe truth is that you don't really need these custom-made massage doohick-\neys, but \nall sorts of neat designs are out there, and some of them, admittedly, \nfeel quite a bit better than \nrocks from your backyard. The ones that apply \nvibration and pressure are especially effective. Everybody should have at \nleast one such gizmo in his or her home. But which one are you going to \nchoose when there are so many shapes and sizes available, as shown in \nFigure 10-15? This section attempts to make a little sense of the whole mas-\nsage device market for you by breaking it down into three categories: \ngravity-assisted gizmos, pressure tools, and mechanical devices. \nFigure 10-15: \nThe choice \nof massage \ngizmos con-\ntinues to \ngrow. \nGravity-assisted gizmos \nThese tools utilize your own \nweight to massage various parts of your body: \n*WO \n3 \nFoot rollers: There are many of these, and most of them look basically \nlike wooden cigars: stubby, brown, and round. Some have grooves \netched into their surface, and others \nhave a series of interconnected \nrolling balls. By running your feet over them, \nyou stimulate nerve end-\nings and reflexology points (see Chapter 14 for more on this). You can \neven buy sandals with hundreds of tiny knobs on the soles that massage \nyour feet as you \nwalk. \nEFTA00008203\n\n755 Part III: The Art of Giving Massage  \n3 Back rollers: Several versions are available. They \nlook similar to the \nrolling pin your mom used to use to make pie crusts. The most famous is \nthe Ma Roller, which has two bumps in the center that are placed on \neither side of your spine. The \ninstructions say not to roll your back \ndown over the knobs, but \nthat's what everyone does, because that's \nwhat feels the best and has the most profound effect. Be careful when \nusing these not to \naccidentally roll hard wood onto your spine itself. \n3 Stretchers: We all need to stretch, and sometimes we could use a little \nhelp from devices like the \"body bridge\" \nwhich is basically a curved \ntable that you bend over \nbackwards on, letting gravity do \nthe stretching. \n3 Body Balancer: A \nmassage pro named Grace Apfel in \nCalifornia, trying to \nrecreate the support and flexibility she offered \nclients with her own \nhands, created the device \nshown in Figure 10-16. You fill the holes with \npegs of \ndifferent heights that you adjust to \nyour particular needs, then \nlie \ndown upon them and just \nrelax It's a good way to let \ngravity do the \nwork in easing \nsome of your back pains for you. \nFigure 10-16: \nMassage \ngizmos have \nbecome \nmore and \nmore \nelabo-\nrate in \nrecent \nyears. \nPressure toots \nAll sorts of devices are \navailable now that you rub on the \nbody with varying \ndegrees \nof pressure. You can get them in specialty \nshops, but they're increas-\ningly available in more common \noutlets such as drug stores. Basically, \nthey \nstimulate acupressure \npoints and trigger points. \nYou can use them to exert \npressure on tough knots and sore \nspots. But be careful: The materials \nused in \nthese tools are \nusually hard, like stone or \nwood. Just a little pressure goes a \nlong way. \nEFTA00008204\n\n Chapter \n10: All the Right \nMoves 159 \n3 \nLittle knobby things: Many little odd-shaped items are now sold that \nyou're supposed to rub across your body (or somebody \nelse's body) for \nfun, pleasure, and relief from stress. Some of them even have names and \npersonalities, like the Happy Massager from the Tender Loving Things \nCompany, Inc. or the Dolphin Massager. You can even order a Handy \nmassage tool from the back of this book, designed by yours truly. It's a \nhand\n-shaped instrument with a perky personality that you can use when \nyour own hands are too tired or not in the mood to give a massage. All of \nthese utilize the same simple concept: Pressing on \npeople makes them \nfeel better. Try them, you'll like them. \n3 \"Captain Hook\" devices: Ever wish you could rubberize your arms and \nreach around to massage a knot in the middle of your back? That, in \nessence, is what these curved devices allow you to do. You can use them \nto hook onto otherwise unreachable tight spots on your posterior sur-\nface. Popular brands Include the Backnobber and the Thera Cane. \n3 \nProfessional pressure tools: There are certain tools that you can only \nget \nin \nmassage clinics that are meant for professional use. One particular \ndevice looks like a sharpened pencil eraser stuck into the side of a \nwooden peg. Neuromuscular therapists use them to work on deep tis-\nsues. If you find professional tools somewhere, you're better off not \nbuying them. They can cause harm if not used by skilled hands. \n3 Rubbing \ngloves: Several brands of textured gloves are now \navailable. \nYou slip \nthem on and then apply pressure and friction over the skin. The \ngloves both exfoliate the skin and stimulate nerve endings. They feel \ngreat, too. \nMechanics! devices \nThere are many mechanical devices on the market that utilize electricity to \ncreate vibration and kneading actions. They range in price from just a few \nbucks to major capital investments. \n3 \nThumper. This is \nprobably the \nbest-known in its \nclass, and its \nname says \nit alit gives a heavy thumping action that simulates a pair of \"chop-\nping\" hands. Great for after workouts or to combat chronic tension, but \nit ain't cheap. \n3 \nVibrating doohickeys: Dozens of these line the shelves, and there's \nalways one that has batteries and is available to test. That's because the \nmanufacturers know that they feel great and that you may want to take \none home when you feel it for yourself. That's a good tactic. However, \nafter you get home, these items tend to see more use as conversation \nstarters than \ntherapeutic devices. \nEFTA00008205\n\n160 \nPart \nIII: The Art of Giving Massage \n3 \nShiatsu massager. This type of unit \nhas kneading lingers\" built into \nit. \nYou put it behind you in a \nchair and lean back \nagainst it. According to \nmany \nreports, they can work \nwonders. Greg, a Journalist friend \nof mine, \nswears by his. He has \na back problem that is exacerbated by \nlong hours \nsitting at the computer, and he credits \nhis Shiatsu massager \nfor \nsaving \nhis career. \n3 \nMassage furniture: \nPanasonic and other well-known \nmanufacturers have \ngotten in on the massage game \nwith electronic chairs and tables that \ngive you a massage while you recline on them. These are fun items to \nhave around the house, but \nthe novelty often wears off pretty quickly, \nand before too long you're left with a \nslightly odd lumpy piece of expen-\nsive furniture. \nThe best gizmo of aft \nWhen it comes to any of these gadgets, the bottom line Is this — they are fun, \nhelpful, and neat, but no amount of technology or ingenuity can create a tool \nmore adaptable, powerful, or sensitive than the human hand. Even the device \nmakers themselves know \nthis. Living Earth Crafts, one of the largest massage \nmanufacturers In the world, has a slogan: \"There is no substitute for the \nhuman touch.\" \nTom Myers, a famed anatomy teacher and structural massage expert, agrees. \nHolding his own hand up for inspection, he \noften comments, \"Twenty-five-\nmillion years in the making. Hard to \nbeat that kind of engineering.\" \nEFTA00008206\n\nChapter 11 \nPutting \nthe Moves \nTogether \nIn This \nChapter \nSetting up \nD \nOil's well that ends well \nMassage rules \nI> The massage \nwas recently watching an episode of the sitcom Friends on 1V, and one of \nthe main themes of the show concerned the effects of massage on friend-\nships \nand \nrelationships. \nThe Monica \ncharacter thought she \ngave a great \nbackrub, but her boyfriend Chandler \nthought otherwise. The whole show \ncentered on how he should break the bad news to her. \nWe humans are sensitive \ncreatures, and when we give something as personal \nas a massage to someone else, we're making ourselves vulnerable to his or her \njudgement. What if they don't like our technique? What if they don't like us? \nWhen you give of yourself through massage, it's natural to be afraid of what \npeople may think and to wonder, secretly, if you're doing it right or if you're \ngood enough. \nI think you should forget all about that stuff. Your massage abilities are not \nsomething to be proud of, or ashamed of. Your abilities are something you \nshould share. \nAs long as you tune in and become sensitive to your partner, you can give a \ngood massage. The idea Is not to focus on being good, but to focus on doing \ngood. \nIf Monica had not been so proud in the beginning, she wouldn't have forced \nher own concept of what she thought was good onto her boyfriend, which set \nthe stage for her to \nfeel rejected and ashamed later. \nBe sensitive. Time \nin. Do good. If you do these things, you never have time to \nworry about whether you're good or not. As long as your heart Is into what \nyou're doing, you're guaranteed to do it the right way. \nEFTA00008207\n\n162 \nPart III: The Art of Giving \nMassage \nSetting Up \nFirst, you need to go over Just a few \npreliminaries to make sure you're set up \nand ready to \ngo. I assume that you've created a \nsuitable inner chamber for \nyour massage experience and that you've practiced a few moves from \nChapter 10. You know what to do and what not to do, and now you just \nhave \nto get \nyourself ready and do it. \nTable \n(or one? \nOne thing you may notice is that the massage in this \nchapter is being given \non the floor. It's pretty much guaranteed that you have a floor available some-\nplace to work on, right? But there's a good chance you don't have a massage \ntable like the ones the pros use. For those of you not familiar with them, mas-\nsage tables are oblong, folding, padded tables. \nMost of them have legs of \nadjustable height, like the one in Figure 11-1. These tables are great tools, and \nif you get serious about massage at some point, you may want to consider \ninvesting in one. New ones cost a few hundred dollars. \nFigure 11-1: \nMassage \ntables look \nlike folding, \nadjustable-\nheight, \noblong, \nupholstered \ncard tables. \n. • \n° \nThe floor can be quite a comfortable place to get a massage, especially if you \nadd a few pillows, a sofa cushion or two, plus a sheet and towels, as you can \nsee \nin Figure 11-2. \nEFTA00008208\n\n Chapter 11: Putting the Moves \nTogether /  63 \nRgure11-t \nYou can \ncreate a \nperfectly \ncomfortable \nmassage \nspace on \nthe floor. \nMany massages have been given on beds, but in those cases the massage \noften leads to other activities — like sleeping! That's right, it's very tempting \nfor the giver to just roll over and lounge around instead of working like he \nshould. When you do give a massage on a bed, arrange some towels near the \nfoot or along one edge, so that you don't have to be up on the bed yourself \nthe whole time \nyou're giving the massage. \nSheets, towels, and so on \nDon't use your best sheets and towels to do a massage on because the oils \nand creams can leave stains and a musty oil smell behind. Also, the color \nwhite seems to show off oil stains the most. Many spas use darker colored \nlinens, like green or blue, for this reason. \nOther things you may want to have around include heating pads, blankets, \nbottle warmers, and other such comfort-creating devices. Nothing's worse \nthan getting a massage and not being able to concentrate on how good it \nfeels because you're shivering the whole time. \n*Mat  It's also a good idea to have some extra pillows to use as bolsters for support \nbeneath your partner. Massage pros use specially made bolsters, as men-\ntioned in Chapter 8, but you can use normal pillows just as effectively. If you \nuse one of your nice pillows, It's a good idea to cover it with a towel to keep It \nfrom getting stained by oil. \nEFTA00008209\n\n164 \nPart The Art of Giving Massage \nOit's Well \nThat Ends Well \nYes, it's true. Massage can be an oily endeavor. In fact, in some countries, \nsuch as India, oil plays a major part in the whole procedure, and about half \nway through a massage people \nin Delhi end up glistening with a layer of lubri-\ncant. This is okay (as long as you have lots \nof towels around to sop up the \nextra oil afterwards). In fact, the Indian system prescribes large amounts of \noil — usually sesame oil — on purpose for its lubricating and detoxifying \neffects. The common wisdom in most other countries, however, is that you \nshould use just enough lubricant to, well, lubricate. \nThis is how you best use oil \nduring a massage: \ntNet \n1. First, choose the oil (see the sidebar later in this chapter). \n2. Second, make sure the oil is not cold. \nWhen you apply cold oil to your partner's skin, it may cause her to hit \nyou or kick you, which is not desirable. The best way to warm the oil is \nto \nplace the bottle in \nhot running water for a few \nminutes, or \nuse a baby \nbottle warmer, until the oil is \nwarm to the touch. Don't microwave the \noil, which can potentially overheat it, causing an equally adverse reac-\ntion from your partner. \n3. Cup one palm and pour a small amount of oil into it. \nIdeally, you want to keep the back of your cupped palm \nin \ncontact with \nyour partner so that you maintain a constant connection. The amount of \noil depends on the size of the area you are massaging, the amount of \nbody hair in the area, and the maneuvers you plan to use. You may have \nto experiment a few times to get the amount right. \n4. Rub your \npalms together for a few seconds to further warm the oil \nand then glide your hands over the skin, \nspreading a smooth layer of \noil over the whole surface you are massaging. \nThe correct amount is the amount that leaves the skin lubricated, but no \npuddles of oil or \"greasy\" spots. \nGetting \ncreamed \nSkin creams and lotions area good alternative \nto oil, and in fact many \nprofessional massage \ntherapists would \nnot be caught using anything \nelse. Cream absorbs more quickly into the skin \nthan oil, so you don't slide around so much. \nGood ones leave a lubricating layer that makes \nit easy to-work. A lot \nof \npros choose a  brand \ncalled Biotone. \nEFTA00008210\n\n Chapter 11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves Together \n165 \nBottle placement \nThere is an age-old feud that has gone on between massage therapists for \ndecades over \nwhere to place the oil bottle during the massage. I  know that \nthis may seem silly to you, but you can rest assured that it's a debate taken \nvery seriously by otherwise intelligent adults. There are basically two \ncamps — those that propose placing the bottle next to the person, where it's \nhandy but liable to get knocked over; and those that propose keeping the \nbottle out of harm's way, on the floor for example, where it's harder to reach \nbut less likely to get kicked or spilled. Some people go as far as to keep their \noil bottles in a specially made holster strung around their waist like a six-gun. \nThis gives the average massage therapist a Wyatt Earp kind of look that is \nperhaps not ideal \nfor inducing relaxation. \nWhere should you put the bottle of oil during a massage? In my professional \nopinion, speaking as a massage therapist who's been working in the field for \nalmost 20 years, it doesn't really matter. Whatever's most comfortable for \nyou is best. \nThe \ntype of \nbottle (and especially the cap) does \nmatter, though. You can \nmake things much easier for yourself if you choose a squeeze-top type cap \nthat pours a tiny bit of oil at a time. Pump tops work well, too. If you use a \nwide-mouth opening, chances are you may end up with oil all over the place, \nespecially if you have your massage area dimly lit with candles. \nYour \nown oil blends \nt%futei. You can \nincorporate the concepts of aromatherapy into your massage by \nadding a few drops of essential oil to the oil you're already using, which is \nthen called the carrier oil. Typical carrier oils include grapeseed, sweet \nalmond, jojoba, avocado, and sesame, which are all good as a base for the \nessential oils. To make your own aromatherapy oil, blend two dozen drops of \nessential oil with 2 ounces of carrier oil. For added aromatherapy benefits, \nplace a few drops in a diffuser to fill the room you're in with the same scent \nyou're using for the \nmassage, as I \nsuggest in Chapter 9. \nTable 11-1 lists the essential oils I  use in my spa therapy workshops and a \ndescription of their basic effects: \nTable \n11-1 Essential oils \nOil Properties \nCedar \nReduces fluids in body tissues, diuretic.

Do no harm. This is the number one rule for giving a massage. Refer to \nChapter 10 and make sure you're aware of the moves that you shouldn't \nmake, the places that you shouldn't press, and the conditions you \nshouldn't treat. \n2. Think &D. Refer to Chapter 4 and try to visualize the physical struc-\ntures beneath the skin that you're affecting with your hands during the \nmassage. \n3. Use your whole \nbody. Remember to use correct body mechanics (see \nChapter 10) in order to save your own body from overexertion while \napplying just the right amount of pressure for your partner. \nA \nEFTA00008212\n\n Chapter 11: Putting the Moves Together 767 \nSo many oils, so little time \nWalk into any bath and \nbody shop or health food \nstore \nand you see at least a  dozen \nchoices in \nmassage oils. Which \nis the best one, you ask? \nIs it the special formula \ndesigned by the spiri-\ntual healer Edgar \nCayce who \"received\" the \nrecipe while in a trance? Or is it the \n\"mango \ntango\" scented blend \nthat your favorite bou-\ntique \ndown the street recently released? \nSeveral oils available straight from the shelf in \nyour local grocery store \nare usable, if not ideal, \nfor massage. Almond oil is used in spas around \nthe world, and you \ncan use sesame oil and olive \noil, too. But the special oils \nformulated just for \nmassage really \nare better. They have more nutri-\nents for \nthe skin, and they create just the \nright \namount of lubrication. In my \nopinion, it's worth \nthe extra money you spend to get a \nhigh-quality \nmassage oil. \nThere are a  few things you want to look for \nwhen \nchoosing an oil: \n3 \nIngredients: Check the ingredients. A \ncommon addition to several oil blends, for \nexample, is lanolin, which comes from art \nanimal source and turns some people \noff. \n3 Scent Make sure the scent is not \noverpow-\nering or synthetic. \n3 \nViscosity: Everyone has his or her own pref-\nerence as far as the right viscosity goes. \n'Thin- oils, such as mineral oil, feel a little \nwatery and spread \nunevenly. This is not \nrecommended. \"Thick\" oils like \ncoconut \nleave a \"greasy\" \nfeeling. Test a little on your \npalm before buying to find an oil somewhere \nin the middle of this \nspectrum that works \nfor \nyou. \n4. \nFocus on the other. This is no time to be thinking about politics, \nsports, \nthe weather, or your upcoming turn to \nreceive. As fully as you can, focus \non your partner, what she's feeling, and how you can make her feel \nbetter. \n5. Go out \nof your mind. \nAfter you figure \nout the \nmoves, \npractice the tech-\nnique, and focus on your partner with all your concentration, then you \ncan stop thinking. That's right. Let go of your \nextraneous thoughts, and \neven \nyour thoughts about doing a good job. \n6. Get creative. Go ahead, go crazy; just let yourself feel \nwhatever you're \nfeeling and go with \nyour intuition. Want to leave one palm on your part-\nner's forehead and the other on her stomach \ncompletely motionless for \nten minutes? That's \nprobably exactly what she needs. As long as what \nyou're doing Is generated from caring and commitment to your partner, \nit Is going to be \nthe right thing. \n7. Let \nlove flow. Certain people develop an ability to send a very distinct \nand palpable sensation of love Into their \nfingers and palms. You can feel it \nwhen \nthey touch you. Everyone else has the potential to develop that abil-\nity. Why not use massage as an opportunity \nto explore your own innate \nabilities to send a powerful message of caring to others through your \ntouch and presence? There are \nworse ways you could spend your time. \nEFTA00008213\n\n168 \nPart \nIII: \nThe \nArt \nof \nGiving \nMassage \nThe \nMassage \nOkay, \nhere \nIt \nis, \nthe \nmoment \nyou've \nall \nbeen \nwaiting \nfor. \nYou \ncan \nonly \ntalk \nabout \nit \nfor \nso \nlong \nwithout \nrealizing \nthat \nmassage \nis \nnot \nreally \nabout \ntalking, \nit's \nabout \nfeeling. \nAnd \nas \nBob \nMarley \nonce \nsaid, \n\"He \nwho \nfeels \nIt, \nknows \nit.\" \nSoon, \nyou \nare \ngoing \nto \nbe \nsailing \naway \ntoward \nhours \nof \nmassage \nbliss. \nAll \nyou \nhave \nto \ndo \nto \nget \nstarted \nis \nfollow \nthese \nfive \neasy \nsteps: \n3 \nCleanliness \nfirst \n3 \nTake \nyour \npositions \n3 \nInvocation \n3 \nThe \nforce, \nLuke, \nremember \nthe \nforce \n3 \nThe \nfirst \ntouch \nCleanliness \nfirst \nYou're \nall \nset \nup, \nthe \nmood \nis \nright, \nthe \nlights \nare \nlow, \nand \nnow, \nbefore \nyou \ndo \nanything \nelse, \nthere's \none \ncritical \nprocedure \nyou \nmust \nfollow \nbefore \nstarting \nthe \nmassage\n—wash \nyour \nhands! \nGood \nhands \nWhat \ndoes \nit \nmean \nto \nhave \n\"good \nhands?\" \nIt's \nthe \none \nquality \nthat \nmillions \nof \nmassage \nlovers \naround \nthe \nworld \nuse \nto \ndescribe \nthe \nessence \nof \nan \nexcellent \nmassage \ntherapist \nAs \nin,\"Oh,that \nwas \nthe \nbest \nmassage \nI \never \nhad. \nYou \nhave \ngot \ngreat \nhands.\" \nBut, \nbecause \nthat \nquality \nis \nso \nvague, \nit's \na \nlittle \ndifficult \nto \nreproduce \nor \nteach \nto \nsomeone \nelse. \nGood \nhands? \nWhat \ndoes \nthat \nmean? \nHaving \ngood \nhands, \nas \nit \nturns \nout, \nis \nnot \nreally \nabout \nyour \nhands. \nIt's \nabout \nYOU. \nIt's \nthe \nway \nyou \nfocus \non \nyour \npartner, \nthe \nway \nyou \nbecome \nsensitive \nto \nher, \nand \nthe \nway \nyou \ncare. \nIt's \nalso \nabout \nfollowing \nsome \nvery \nsimple \nguidelines, \nwhich \nI \ncall \nthe \n\"rules \nfor \ngiving \nmassage: \nYou \ncan \nfind \nthose \nrules \nright \nhere \nin \nthis \nchapter. \nFollow \nthese \nsimple \nprinciples, \nand \nyou \nmay \neven \ngo \nbeyond \nhavinugood \nhands \nto \nhaving \n\"great \nhands\" \none \nday. \nEFTA00008214\n\n \nChapter 11: \nPutting \nthe \nMoves \nTogether 169 \nBut do I have to \ncut my nails? \nOnce I was hired to present a massage work-\nshop \nat a  huge annual convention of nail \ntechnicians (manicurists) in Detroit. I  never \nknew so many manicurists existed before. \nDemonstrating some basic massage moves on \nthe \nfeet of one class member, I then told them to \nexchange similar moves. Soon, the room was \nfilled with sounds of pain and \ndiscomfort. \nThese women had nails an \ninch and a half long. \nSharp nails. Some of them had holes drilled in \nthe ends \nof their nails, and miniature charm \nbracelets dangled throughthem. It was impos-\nsible for them to practice massage. \nIf you have long nails, it's going \nto be awfully \nhard for you to give a good massage. One of the \nfirstthings people are told when they sign up for \nmassage school is to cut their nails, and you can \noften tell a \nmassage pro by her extremely short \nand neatly \ntrimmed \nnails. \nDoes this mean you have to lop off your own \ndearly beloved nails \nin order to give a massage? \nNot necessarily. If your husband is the only \nperson you're going to be massaging, and he \nlikes it when you run your long nails down his \nback, don't worry \nabout cutting them. You can \nimprovise massage moves by using your palms \nand the bottoms of your fingers, keeping your \nnails \nlifted •up.out of the way. However, if your \nnails are \nlong.andyour intention isto.get better \nat massage and perform all the moves \ndescribed here to their fullest, you have some \nserious \nclipping to do in your near future. \nWashing cleanses away dirt and grime, and it also protects you and your \npartner from nasty bacteria. It's a good habit to get into. \nTake your positions \nTo begin the massage, you and your partner both have to be in the \nright posi-\ntions. In the routine shown in this \nchapter, you start with your partner lying \non her back, and you sit up near her head. \nSome \npeople are sticklers about this whole positioning issue, but I don't \nbelieve In starting every massage in \nthe same position every time. In fact, \nstarting over and over again in the same position can lead to complacency \nand a boring massage. It's better to begin each massage where you are drawn \nto begin by your intuition, your partner's suggestion, and your observation. \nIs she all hunched over by tight \nback muscles? Then by all means start the \nmassage with her facedown, working on her back. The sequence of the mas-\nsage shown in this chapter is \nnot the only way. \nEFTA00008215\n\n70 \nPart \nIII: \nThe \nArt \nof \nGiving \nMassage \nInvocation \nYou \nmay \nrecall \nthat \nin
