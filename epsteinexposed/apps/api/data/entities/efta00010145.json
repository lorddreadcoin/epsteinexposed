Thanks, team!! \nFrom \nSe • • \nTo: \nCc \nSubject: Re: Discovery \nEFTA00010145\n\nI can handle, currently unpacking some stuff from trial but will look for the drive and try and load it later this afternoon. \nCould one of you please just let me know what discovery needs to be loaded onto it (or since which date) since I've been \nout of the loop for a bit? \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jul 13, 2021, at 12:29 PM \nHi team, \nwrote: \nAny chance one of you would be able to track down a drive that Maxwell's lawyers dropped off yesterday for \nplease? Or if not, any chance you could point us to someone who would be able to help find the drive? \nWe need to get it loaded with the most recent productions that went to Maxwell on CDs. \n\"mhanks \nFrom \nSent: Monda Jul12, 2021 10:57 PM \nTo \nc: \nSubject: RE: Discovery \nWe dropped off the drive this afternoon.

I wanted to circle back with you about two discovery issues. First, a little while back you said \nthat you would be producing to us additional non-testifying 3500 material. When can we expect to receive that? \nSecond, you produced the last few productions to Ms. Maxwell on disk. Those disks are now not working. We will drop \noff a hard drive to you on Monday. Please reload those productions onto the hard drive and send it to Ms. Maxwell in \nMDC. If the additional non-testifying 3500 material is ready to be produced, please include that on the drive. \nRegards, \n<image00 I  j pg> \nNew \nYork I  Paris I  Washington \nDC \nLondon \n<image002.jpg> \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this e-mail may be confidential and/or privileged.
