Introduction \nA. Affiant \n1. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBP\") since \n2017. During that time, I have participated in numerous investigations and prosecutions of crimes \nagainst children, including the sex trafficking of minors. I have also participated in the execution \nof multiple search warrants. \n2. I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the \"Subject \nPremises\") for the purpose of photographing, video-recording or otherwise documenting the \nappearance of its interior, and to seize the items and information described in Attachment A. This \naffidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and \nmy conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted \nfor the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I  have \nlearned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, \nstatements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in \npart, except where otherwise indicated. \n2 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028389\n\nB. The Subject Premises \n3. The Subject Premises are particularly described as a  nearly 19,000 square foot \nmulti-story, single-family residence located at 9  East 71st Street, New York, New York, and \ninclude all locked and closed containers found therein. As detailed further herein, the Subject \nPremises is believed to be owned, possessed and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, a  target \nsubject of this investigation. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises is included \nbelow: \nC. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses \n4. The Target Subject of this investigation is JEFFREY EPSTEIN. \n5. For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that \nthe Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United \nStates Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors) and Title 18, United States Code, Section \n371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the \"Subject Offenses\") \nby the Target Subject. \n3 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028390\n\nH. Probable Cause \nA. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject's Commission of the \nSubject Offenses \n6. On or about July 2, 2019. a  grand jury in this District returned an Indictment \ncharging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with the Subject Offenses. A copy of the Indictment is attached \nhereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated by reference. \nB. Probable Cause Justifying Search of the Subject Premises \n7. As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least \nin or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in the Southern \nDistrict of New York and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present, EPSTEIN \npossessed and \ncontrolled the Subject Premises, which is described in Exhibit A as \"the New York \nResidence.\" \n8. As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or \nabout 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous \nminor victims at the Subject Premises. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a \nvictim arrived at the Subject Premises, she would be escorted to a room inside the Subject Premises \nwith a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, who were \nas young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully undress \nbefore beginning the \"massage.\" During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and \nscope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping \nand direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also \nmasturbate during these sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, \nand touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. Following each encounter, EPSTEIN \nor one of his \nemployees or associates paid the victim in cash. \n4 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028391\n\n9. As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability \nto abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked and enticed certain \nof his victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform \"massages\" and similarly engage in sex \nacts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both \nthe victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his \nvictims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age. \n10. One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of \nthe FBI's investigation of EPSTEIN, other law enforcement officers and I  have interviewed \nVictim-1i I know from my personal participation of interviews with Victim-1, my conversations \nwith other law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-1, and my review of notes and \nreports of other interviews with Victim-I that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in \nsubstance and in part: \na. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on \nmultiple occasions in the Subject Premises. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was \nunder the age of 18. \nb. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the Subject Premises \nand numerous individual rooms within the Subject Premises. Victim-1 has provided detailed \ndescriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including Victim-1 's \nIn meetings with the Government, Victim-1 has disclosed that, approximately a decade ago, she \ncommitted marriage fraud in order to obtain a green card and, subsequently, U.S. citizenship. She \nhas also disclosed personal substance abuse, primarily involving the abuse of prescription drugs, \nduring various periods between the early 2000s and 2019. Victim-1 has also disclosed having \nworked for approximately a year at a \"happy-ending\" massage parlor, performing paid sex acts. \nVictim-1 is currently pursuing a civil damages claim against EPSTEIN for his sexual abuse of her. \nInformation provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent \nevidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of \nother victims whom Victim-1 has never met. \n5 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028392\n\nmemory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of \nvarious areas within the Subject Premises. \nII. I know from my review of publicly available corporate and property records that at \nall times relevant to the Subject Offenses as alleged in the Indictment, the Subject Premises was \nowned by Nine East 71st Street Corporation (the \"Corporation\"). The President of the Corporation \nis listed as JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and no other officers or occupants are identified on the \nCorporation paperwork. In or around December 2011, the Subject Premises was transferred from \nthe Corporation to another corporate entity, Maple, Inc., which is registered in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, where EPSTEIN was then known to and continues to reside. Though no officer of Maple, \nInc., is identified in the transfer paperwork, the signature of both the buyer and seller in the \ntransaction appear to be the same. Moreover, the deed lists the consideration for the transfer of \nthe Subject Premises as $10, an amount facially inconsistent with a fair market transfer to a third \nparty. \n12. I  know from my participation in this investigation that EPSTEIN has continued to \npossess and control the Subject Premises from at least in or about 2002 to the present. In particular, \nI  know from my review of Sex Offender Registration records that EPSTEIN presently lists the \nSubject Premises as one of his residences. Moreover, as described in paragraph 11, above, \nalthough ownership of Subject Premises was transferred from one corporate entity to another in \nDecember 2011, both corporations appear to be under EPSTEIN's control, and EPSTEIN appears \nto remain the sole owner and occupant of the Subject Premises. \n13. Additionally, although Victim-1 has not been in the Subject Premises since in or \naround 2005, based on my review of publicly available records maintained by the New York City \nDepartment of Buildings (\"DOB\"), it  does not appear that there have been any significant or \n6 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028393\n\nstructural renovations to the interior of the Subject Premises since that time. In particular, the \nDOB reflects only three approved alteration permits for the Subject Premises, one in or around \n2011 which authorized facade restoration but expressly noted that there would be \"no change to \noccupancy, use egress or bulk,\" and two permitting the \"installation of heavy duty sidewalk shed\" \noutside of the Subject Premises at various points, but similarly noting that there would be \"no \nchanges in use, egress or occupancy.\" As such, while it is possible that certain interior decorations \nhave changed since 2005, it is probable that structural components of the interior, such as \nVictim-I's description of the layout of rooms and floors, among other details, would remain the \nsame. \n7 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028394\n\nIII. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions \n14. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe \nthat photographing, video-recording, and otherwise documenting the appearance of the interior of \nthe Subject Premises, and seizing the items described in Attachment A, will yield evidence of the \nSubject Offenses. In particular, evidence depicting the interior of the Subject Premises and \nreflecting the occupancy, ownership, layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of the \nSubject Premises will corroborate Victim-1's account of EPSTEIN's commission of the Subject \nOffenses. I further submit that there is probable cause to believe that such evidence will be located \nwithin the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the items \nand information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure Warrant. \nSpecial Agent \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nSworn \nto before me on \nJuly \n5, 2019 \nTHEHONORABLE BARBARA MOSES \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n8 \n2017.08.02 \nEFTA00028395\n\nATTACHMENT A \nI.

As set forth herein, over the course of many \nyears, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and \nabused \ndozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, \nNew \nYork, and Palm Beach, Florida, among \nother locations. \n2. In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up \nto and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed \nand recruited, and caused to be enticed and \nrecruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New \nYork (the \"New York Residence\") and his estate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida \n(the \"Palm Beach Residence\") to engage in sex acts with \nhim, after \nwhich he would give the victims hundreds of dollars \nin cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his \nsupply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to \nrecruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In \nEFTA00028398\n\nthis way, EPSTEIN created a vast network \nof underage victims for \nhim to sexually exploit in locations including New York and \nPalm \nBeach. \n3. \nThe victims described herein were as young as 14 \nyears old at the time they \nwere abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, and were, for various reasons, often \nparticularly \nvulnerable to \nexploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out \nminors and knew \nthat many of his victims were in fact under the \nage of 18, including because, in some \ninstances, minor victims \nexpressly \ntold him their age. \n4. In creating and \nmaintaining this network of minor \nvictims in \nmultiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired \nwith \nothers, including \nemployees and associates who facilitated his \nconduct by, among other things, contacting victims and \nscheduling their sexual \nencounters with EPSTEIN at the New York \nResidence and at the Palm Beach Residence. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. During \nall time periods charged in this \nIndictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a \nfinancier with \nmultiple residences in the continental United States, including \nthe New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. \n6. Beginning in at least \n2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and \n2 \nEFTA00028399\n\nrecruited, \ndozens \nof \nminor \ngirls \nto \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nhim, \nafter \nwhich \nEPSTEIN \npaid \nthe \nvictims \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash, \nat \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nand \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence. \n7. \nIn \nboth \nNew \nYork \nand \nFlorida, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nperpetuated \nthis \nabuse \nin \nsimilar \nways. \nVictims \nwere \ninitially \nrecruited \nto \nprovide \n\"massages\" \nto \nEPSTEIN, \nwhich \nwould \nbe \nperformed \nnude \nor \npartially \nnude, \nwould \nbecome \nincreasingly \nsexual \nin \nnature, \nand \nwould \ntypically \ninclude \none \nor \nmore \nsex \nacts. \nEPSTEIN \npaid \nhis \nvictims \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash \nfor \neach \nencounter. \nMoreover, \nEPSTEIN \nactively \nencouraged \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nto \nbe \nsimilarly \nsexually \nabused. \nEPSTEIN \nincentivized \nhis \nvictims \nto \nbecome \nrecruiters \nby \npaying \nthese \nvictim\n-recruiters \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nfor \neach \ngirl \nthat \nthey \nbrought \nto \nEPSTEIN. \nIn \nso \ndoing, \nEPSTEIN \nmaintained \na \nsteady \nsupply \nof \nnew \nvictims \nto \nexploit. \nThe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \n8. \nAt \nall \ntimes \nrelevant \nto \nthis \nIndictment, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \npossessed \nand \ncontrolled \na \nmulti\n-story \nprivate \nresidence \non \nthe \nUpper \nEast \nSide \nof \nManhattan, \nNew \nYork, \ni.e., \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence. \nBetween \nat \nleast \nin \nor \nabout \n2002 \nand \nin \nor \nabout \n2005, \nEPSTEIN \nabused \nnumerous \nminor \nvictims \nat \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nby \ncausing \nthese \nvictims \nto \nbe \nrecruited \nto \nengage \nin \npaid \nsex \nacts \nwith \nhim. \n3 \nEFTA00028400\n\n9. When a \nvictim arrived at the New York Residence, \nshe typically would be escorted to a room with a \nmassage table, \nwhere she would perform a \nmassage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant. The victims, who were as \nyoung as 14 years of age, \nwere told by \nEPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully \nundress before beginning the \n\"massage.\" During the encounter, \nEPSTEIN \nwould escalate the nature and scope of \nphysical contact \nwith his \nvictim to include, among other things, sex acts such as \ngroping and direct and \nindirect contact with the victim's \ngenitals. EPSTEIN typically would also \nmasturbate during these \nsexualized \nencounters, ask victims to touch him while he \nmasturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his \nhands or with \nsex toys. \n10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of \nhis employees or associates, \npaid \nthe victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds \nof dollars in cash for each \nencounter. \n11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nthe defendant, knew that many of \nhis New York \nvictims were underage, including because \ncertain \nvictims told him their age. \nFurther, once these minor victims \nwere recruited, many \nwere abused by EPSTEIN on multiple \nsubsequent occasions at the New York Residence. \nEPSTEIN \nsometimes \npersonally contacted victims to schedule appointments \nat the New York Residence. In \nother instances, EPSTEIN directed \n4 \nEFTA00028401\n\nemployees \nand \nassociates, \nincluding \na \nNew \nYork\n-based \nemployee \n(\"Employee\n-1\"), \nto \ncommunicate \nwith \nvictims \nvia \nphone \nto \narrange \nfor \nthese \nvictims \nto \nreturn \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nfor \nadditional \nsexual \nencounters \nwith \nEPSTEIN. \n12. \nAdditionally, \nand \nto \nfurther \nfacilitate \nhis \nability \nto \nabuse \nminor \ngirls \nin \nNew \nYork, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nasked \nand \nenticed \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nto \nperform \n\"massages\" \nand \nsimilarly \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nEPSTEIN. \nWhen \na \nvictim \nwould \nrecruit \nanother \ngirl \nfor \nEPSTEIN, \nhe \npaid \nboth \nthe \nvictim\n-recruiter \nand \nthe \nnew \nvictim \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nin \ncash. \nThrough \nthese \nvictim\n-\nrecruiters, \nEPSTEIN \ngained \naccess \nto \nand \nwas \nable \nto \nabuse \ndozens \nof \nadditional \nminor \ngirls. \n13. \nIn \nparticular, \ncertain \nrecruiters \nbrought \ndozens \nof \nadditional \nminor \ngirls \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence \nto \ngive \nmassages \nto \nand \nengage \nin \nsex \nacts \nwith \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant. \nEPSTEIN \nencouraged \nvictims \nto \nrecruit \nadditional \ngirls \nby \noffering \nto \npay \nthese \nvictim\n-recruiters \nfor \nevery \nadditional \ngirl \nthey \nbrought \nto \nEPSTEIN. \nWhen \na \nvictim\n-\nrecruiter \naccompanied \na \nnew \nminor \nvictim \nto \nthe \nNew \nYork \nResidence, \nboth \nthe \nvictim\n-recruiter \nand \nthe \nnew \nminor \nvictim \nwere \npaid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nby \nEPSTEIN \nfor \neach \nencounter. \nIn \naddition, \ncertain \nvictim\n-recruiters \nroutinely \nscheduled \nthese \n5 \nEFTA00028402\n\nencounters through Employee-1, \nwho sometimes asked the \nrecruiters \nto bring a specific minor girl for \nEPSTEIN. \nThe Palm Beach Residence \n14. In addition to recruiting and \nabusing minor girls \nin New York, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar \nnetwork of minor girls to \nvictimize in Palm Beach, Florida, \nwhere EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large \nresidence, \ni.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently \ntraveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before \nwhich an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims \nwere available \nfor encounters upon his arrival in Florida. \n15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. \nWhen a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she \nwould be \nescorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of \nEPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants (\"Employee-2\" and \n\"Employee-3\") who, as \ndescribed herein, were also responsible \nfor scheduling sexual \nencounters with minor victims. Once \ninside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage \nfor \nEPSTEIN, who \nwould himself typically be naked. During these \nencounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the \nphysical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct \nand indirect contact with the victim's genitals. \nEPSTEIN would \nalso \ntypically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims \n6 \nEFTA00028403\n\nto \ntouch \nhim \nwhile \nhe \nmasturbated, \nand \ntouch \nvictims' \ngenitals \nwith \nhis \nhands \nor \nwith \nsex \ntoys. \n16. \nIn \nconnection \nwith \neach \nsexual \nencounter, \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nor \none \nof \nhis \nemployees \nor \nassociates, \n• \npaid \nthe \nvictim \nin \ncash. \nVictims \ntypically \nwere \npaid \nhundreds \nof \ndollars \nfor \neach \nencounter. \n17. \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nknew \nthat \ncertain \nof \nhis \nvictims \nwere \nunderage, \nincluding \nbecause \ncertain \nvictims \ntold \nhim \ntheir \nage. \nIn \naddition, \nas \nwith \nNew \nYork\n-based \nvictims, \nmany \nFlorida \nvictims, \nonce \nrecruited, \nwere \nabused \nby \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \non \nmultiple \nadditional \noccasions. \n18. \nJEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, \nthe \ndefendant, \nwho \nduring \nthe \nrelevant \ntime \nperiod \nwas \nfrequently \nin \nNew \nYork, \nwould \narrange \nfor \nEmployee\n-2 \nor \nother \nemployees \nto \ncontact \nvictims \nby \nphone \nin \nadvance \nof \nEPSTEIN's \ntravel \nto \nFlorida \nto \nensure \nappointments \nwere \nscheduled \nfor \nwhen \nhe \narrived. \nIn \nparticular, \nin \ncertain \ninstances, \nEmployee\n-2 \nplaced \nphone \ncalls \nto \nminor \nvictims \nin \nFlorida \nto \nschedule \nencounters \nat \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence. \nAt \nthe \ntime \nof \ncertain \nof \nthose \nphone \ncalls, \nEPSTEIN \nand \nEmployee\n-2 \nwere \nin \nNew \nYork, \nNew \nYork. \nAdditionally, \ncertain \nof \nthe \nindividuals \nvictimized \nat \nthe \nPalm \nBeach \nResidence \nwere \ncontacted \nby \nphone \nby \nEmployee\n-3 \nto \nschedule \nthese \nencounters. \n7 \nEFTA00028404\n\n19. Moreover, as \nin New York, to ensure a steady \nstream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, asked \nand enticed \ncertain victims in Florida to recruit other girls \nto \nengage in sex acts.
