I am cc'ing you on a letter to \nJay Lefkowitz, Roy Black, and Jack Goldberger informing them of the request and asking them, as parties to the \ncriminal case, to contact you regarding a possible suit by the Shiny Sheet. \nOn another note, I also will be informing them that I  believe that they still have not filed the complete agreement \nwith the Court, as required by the Judge at the hearing. \nThank you very much for reaching out to us when you received this request, and if you need any help from us, \nplease let us know. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nEFTA00014172",
