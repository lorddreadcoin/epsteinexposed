Long story short, a friend of a family friend was a model in NYC 20 years ago and was taken to Epstein's \ntownhouse one night. Not sure what happened be I  haven't spoken to her yet, but I understand something \nhappened. She has talked to David Boise, and his firm is now all over her with calls and she doesn't know what \nto do. I said i  would talk to you but don't know if your office is still involved in the case at all or is in touch with \nvictims. If so, I can steer her in the right direction. I  know it's an odd text, so thanks for any connection you can \nmake for me. Thanks and look forward to seeing you in DC. \nEFTA00024434",
