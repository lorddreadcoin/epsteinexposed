This practice and approach resonates with the law as set out in United \nStates v. Allen, 864 F.3d (2d Cir.2017). We also attach an extract from the publication `Montgomery and Ormerod on \nFraud: Criminal Law and Procedure' (2008) which summarises the approach taken by the Serious Fraud Office (see A7-\n327) to the limitations and protections on use when their compulsory powers are used in MLAT requests, an approach \nwhich reflects such cases as Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441 (1972) as well as decisions in UK domestic law. We \nreiterate the protection at Article 7 (2) of the MLAT treaty although there is no need to attach it. \nKind regards \nDaniel Cundy \nI \nPartner \nRANKED IN • \nCliaml)ers \n11:11 II \nBlackfords LLP I I London I EC4M 7EF \nlb UK AP \n:1111I \nI www.blackfords.com \nCt. \nIto si(y)0 \nCOVID-19 —  Please see our websiteherefor our updated position in relation to Coronavirus. \nIn the meantime if you need to speak to one of our lawyers, please leave a voicemail by dialling \nwhere we will respond to the messages in the order they are received or by emailing your \nenquiry to \nBlackfords LLP is a limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number OC325398 at \nCroydon, CR0 LEA.
