Except for \nItem 8, this request seems fairly contained—and they have expressly cabined their request to not seek documents that \nwould interfere with ongoing proceedings. Please let me know if we need to discuss. Otherwise, I'll draft a letter once we \nhave the dots gathered (happy to do redactions again if helpful). \nThanks, \nFrom: Robert Glassman c \nSent: Monday, June 8, 2020 3:08 PM \nTo: \nCc: >; Nathan Werksman Keilah \nBetts \nSubject: Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request); Jane Doe v.
