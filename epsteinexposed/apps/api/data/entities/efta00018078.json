I  think we should include everything we got. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn \nJan 30, 2020, at 7:21 PM,  l> wrote: \nI apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the \norder, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it \ndoesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents —that may be because they're not referenced in any \nwill? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless \nsomebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any \ndocuments on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with and/or tomorrow on any of this, \nor just ignore it if I've misread. \nthanks, \nFrom: \n(USANYS)1. \nSent: Thursday, January 30, 2020 12:05 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein Sharing Order Part II \n(USANYS) \n> \nJust wanted to circle back on this —MR are you signed off?

If so, I'll just add it to every mention of each document, but if not then it's \nunnecessary. I don't think those are substantive dots but I defer. \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Wednesday, January 29, 2020 15:55 \nTo: \n•=> \n(USANYS) \nEFTA00018078\n\nCc: \ncz'; \nSubject: RE: Epstein Sharing Order Part II \nII \nPlease add it in the right place and send me the order.

Would you take a look when you can? \n- I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. \nWould you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized \nthe new stuff we're looking to share? \nThanks, \n<2019.12.19 Epstein 6(e) App Order.ebd.ajr.docx (002) (002).docx> \nEFTA00018079",
