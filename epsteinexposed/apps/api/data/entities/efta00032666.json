She granted Maxwell's motion to \nsever the perjury counts but denied the remaining motions, except for the suppression motions with respect to the Boies \nSchiller materials, which she punted on. \nThere is some mildly positive language in here about our discovery approach in this case, and she notes that our pretrial \ndisclosure schedule is generally reasonable and will allow Maxwell to prepare for trial in July (which hopefully bodes well \nfor the trial adjournment motion). \nDeputy Chief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nDesk \nCell \nEFTA00032666",
