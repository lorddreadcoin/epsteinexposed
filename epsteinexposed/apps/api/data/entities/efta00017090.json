    "text": "\n\nJeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple, for the last 11 years. \nThey are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart —  I almost always \nsee them \ntogether \nGhislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an \ninfectious laugh who always puts one at ones ease, and \nalways makes one \nfeel \nwelcome. \nJeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun \ntogether. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew \nup amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment. \nThey share a love of travel and art. She \nspeaks 5 languages. She enjoys \nspending time visiting auction houses (she says that is the best way to learn \nabout art and antiques —  your \nexpected to look touch and ask questions) \nGhislaine also has her own interests and has \nher own business pursuits —  she \nis independent and strong willed - something which Jeffrey loves about her -\nShe is adventurous -  she flies helicopters, she is athletic — she rides horses, \nplays tennis, skis and scuba dives. She \nis a serious photographer (she always \nhas a camera in hand) who is collaborating with some of the leading people \ninvolved at the cutting edge of digital photography. \nJeffrey and Ghislaine compliment each other really well and I cannot \nimagine one without the other. On top of being great partners they are also \nthe \nbest of friends. \nEFTA00017090",
