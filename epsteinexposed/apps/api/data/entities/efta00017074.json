(\"Miami Herald\") respectfully submit this response to \nMs. Maxwell's Memorandum Brief in Support of Her Objections to Unsealing Sealed Materials \n(Dkt. 1057) (\"the Objections\")} \nARGUMENT \nMs. Maxwell's objections to the unsealing of Dkt. Entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 (and \nrelated submissions) are entirely without merit, and these documents should be unsealed in their \nentirety. The objections mischaracterize the governing law, including the Second Circuit's ruling \nin Brown v.  Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41 (2d. Cir. 2019); rely upon general \"alleged countervailing \ninterests\" against disclosure that are not supported by the extensive body of case law addressing \nwhether a judicial document may be sealed by the Court; and assert unsubstantiated, generalized, \nand speculative harms based on the alleged countervailing interests that are insufficient to \noutweigh the presumption of access to these judicial documents. \nAs set forth in detail below, there is no basis identified in the Objections for the Court to \ncontinue sealing Dkt. Entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 (and related docket entries identified by \nMs. Maxwell). \nI. Ms. Maxwell Mischaracterizes Brown v. Maxwell. \nMs. Maxwell's filing selectively quotes from the Second Circuit's ruling in Brown v. \nMaxwell in an attempt to minimize the right of access that attaches to all judicial documents. \nMaxwell's repeated assertion that these documents are entitled to \"a minimal presumption of \naccess\" is directly contradicted by the Second Circuit's conclusion that \"the presumption of access \nto \"materials submitted in connection with, and relevant to, discovery motions, motions in limine, \n' Counsel for Intervenors has not seen these documents and submits this response based on the list \nof Decided Motions prepared by counsel for the Parties and Ms. Maxwell's Objections. \nEFTA00017075\n\ncasgemgW6143§tiumeneekt-OrgefifilVo4fheifigf23028v4ef31th 10 \nand other non-dispositive motions\" is \"substantial.\" Brown v.  Maxwell, 929 F.3d at 53 (2d. Cir. \n2019). \nIt is also well-established that the party requesting that documents remain sealed bears the \nheavy burden of demonstrating that there are compelling competing factors that outweigh the \npresumption of access that attaches to each of the judicial documents at issue here. See Delta Air \nLines, Inc. v.  Bombardier, Inc., No. 1:20-CV-3025-GHW, 2020 WL 2614704, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. \nMay 22, 2020); Bernsten v. O'Reilly, 307 F. Supp. 3d 161, 168 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Lytle v. \nJPMorgan Chase, 810 F. Supp. 2d 616, 621-22 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Those factors and the harm of \ndisclosure must be identified with specificity. Lytle, 810 F. Supp. 2d at 621-22. None of Ms. \nMaxwell's Objections meets this heavy burden. \nII. Ms. Maxwell's General Objections Are Without Merit. \nMs. Maxwell asserts objections based on alleged \"countervailing interests\" that are not \nrecognized in the extensive body of case law addressing whether a  judicial document may be \nsealed by the Court. \nA. Reliance on a Protective Order By a Party or Non-Party \nMs. Maxwell argues that, if a party or non-party relies on a protective order or sealing order \nand provides information in discovery, the information must remain sealed. This is incorrect. \nFirst, courts in this Circuit have routinely ordered unsealing of documents in cases with \nprotective orders or confidentiality provisions. See, e.g., Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d \n133, 143 (2d Cir. 2004) (unsealing judicial document despite party's claim that it had settled claim \nto \"avoid public disclosure at trial of the temporarily sealed documents\"); Bernsten v.  O'Reilly, \n307 F. Supp. 3d 161 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (unsealing documents submitted in support of motion to \ncompel arbitration despite parties' agreement to file them under seal); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. \nWales LLC, 993 F.Supp.2d 409, 414 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (holding the fact that the agreement \n2 \nEFTA00017076\n\ncasgamgfic26143 Piton enbigniefiFili00446g2teagcsthefat 10 \n\"contains a confidentiality clause is not binding here, given the public's right of access to `judicial \ndocuments'\").2  Courts do so, recognizing that \"[t]he presumption of public access would become \nvirtually meaningless if it could be overcome by the mutual interest of the parties...\" Wolinsky v. \nScholastic Inc., 900 F.Supp.2d 332, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). \nAnd second, here, the plain terms of the Protective Order do not support Maxwell's reliance \nargument. The Protective Order at issue specifically provided that it  would \"have no force and \neffect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial.\" Dkt. 39-1, at 6. Therefore, \nthe Protective Order contemplated certain information becoming public at trial, and any party's \nreliance on the Protective Order to prevent all sensitive information from becoming public is \nunfounded. \nB. Prevention of the Abuse of Court Records and Files \nMs. Maxwell again mischaracterizes Brown v. Maxwell in stating that the Court should use \nsealing orders to prevent abuse of court records and files. In Brown v. Maxwell, the Second \nCircuit's instruction that courts should manage their dockets to ensure that court filings are not \nabused was made in the context of providing alternatives to sealing, which the Court noted are \n\"often preferable\" to sealing, including \"explaining on the record that the statements appear to lack \ncredibility\" and striking from the record materials that are \"redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or \n2  The case relied on by Maxwell is not to the contrary. Instead, Martindell v.  Int'l Tel. & TeL \nCorp., 594 F.2d 291, 297 (2d Cir. 1979), addresses only whether reliance on a  valid protective \norder may be a considered as a countervailing interest to disclosure. But here, the Second Circuit \nhas already held that the protective order was not valid, as implemented. See Brown v. Maxwell, \n929 F.3d 41 (2d. Cir. 2019). Therefore, Martindell is not applicable. Further, in later cases, the \nSecond Circuit limited Martindell's ruling to cases involving documents that were not \"judicial \ndocuments\" subject to a presumption of access. See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. \n1995). \n3 \nEFTA00017077\n\ncasQam§feZot4AceguneoUgnieAFP95?044leiPtit§f2V28aftbef51M 10 \nscandalous.\" Brown, 929 F.3d at 49 n.28, 51-52. Ms. Maxwell's argument, here, turns that \nreasoning on its head. \nMs. Maxwell also provides no basis for her conclusory statements that the documents at \nissue \nwere \"abusively filed\" court records and files. \nC. Annoyance, Embarrassment, Oppression, and Undue Burden \nRule 26 allows protective orders to issue that allow the sealing of materials upon a showing \nof good cause that they are likely to cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue \nburden. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26; Brown, 929 F.3d at 51. \nSimply stating that questions were \"intrusive\" or \"embarrassing,\" however, is insufficient \nto meet the good cause standard of Rule 26, especially when the allegations at issue in the litigation \nconcern the sexual abuse of young girls at the hands of the wealthy and powerful. Framing \nallegations of sexual abuse as \"private\" protects perpetrators at the expense of victims. The Miami \nHerald's coverage of Mr. Epstein's and his associates' alleged crimes has nothing to do with \nconsensual sexual preferences and everything to do with the abuse of young girls, whether that \ncrime was justly prosecuted or, instead, whether it was quietly dispensed with by the legal system \nto protect the reputations of well-connected adults. This is not information that could be \nreasonably characterized as exposing Ms. Maxwell to \"annoyance\" or \"embarrassment\" in a way \nthat could support continued sealing under the good cause standard of Rule 26. \nD. Rights of Suspects Under Criminal Investigation \nMs. Maxwell also claims that the mere existence of criminal investigations into Mr. Epstein \nand his associates' conduct warrants the sealing of materials because it is \"unclear who are \nwitnesses or targets of any investigation.\" Dkt. 1057, at 6. The cases she relies on stand for the \ngeneral proposition that documents may sometimes be sealed to protect the integrity of criminal \n4 \nEFTA00017078\n\ncasceamgQAR6nag'49kcnenbt•NeffFiWo*lieZt3&@f2V2f?an§ef61•9f 10 \ninvestigations. See United States v. Longueuil, 567 F.App'x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2014) (finding it was \nnot an abuse of discretion to allow continued sealing of discovery materials that were not judicial \ndocuments and that reflected sensitive information about cooperating witnesses and the \ngovernment's investigative methods and techniques); Hardy v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of \nUnited States, 697 F. App'x 723, 725 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting generally that protection of ongoing \ninvestigations and safety of witnesses may be countervailing interests). \nHowever, Ms. Maxwell's generalized assertion that there are ongoing criminal \ninvestigations is wholly insufficient to warrant sealing. See United States v. Huntley, 943 F. Supp. \n2d 383, 387 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying request to seal in high-profile case and noting \"Where will \nbe no surprises to the potentially accused by the revelations of their names. Interference with \nongoing investigations will be of almost no significance.\"). Further, it is completely unreasonable \nto allow Ms. Maxwell —  a potential target of investigations —  to assert this as a \"countervailing \ninterest\" under the circumstances. This would lead to an absurd result in which court documents \nthat could shed light on how Mr. Epstein's alleged crimes were kept secret for so long would be \nsealed to protect the perpetrators at the expense of victims and the public. \nE. Improper Submission of Documents \nMs. Maxwell contends that documents submitted for a \"non-merits purpose\" should remain \nsealed or redacted if there is any interest in sealing or redaction. The case she cites, SEC v. \nTheStreetcom, 273 F.3d 222 (2d Cir. 2001), does not support this argument, nor are Intervenors \naware of any case supporting this position. This position is directly in conflict with Brown v. \nMaxwell. \n5 \nEFTA00017079\n\ncasgamgric26140-9swienbt-ilnlefiFili004belt3gfrateafthef718f 10 \nAll of the documents at issue appear to have been submitted to the Court for purposes of \nan adjudication call upon the court to exercise its Article III powers and are judicial documents.' \nMs. Maxwell's arguments to the contrary are wholly unsupported. \nF. Untrustworthy, Unreliable, and Incorrect Information \nMs. Maxwell contends that material submitted to the court should not be unsealed because \nit  is untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect. Again, Ms. Maxwell offers little support for those \nconclusions, relying on hearsay requirements found in the Federal Rules of Evidence.4   This \nargument conflates the admissibility requirements and sealing requirements. See Burton v. \nZwicker & Assocs., No. CV 10-227-WOB-JGW, 2012 WL 12925759, at *1 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 24, \n2012) (\"[D]efendant cites no authority—nor has the Court independently located any—which \nsupports the sealing of documents based upon alleged evidentiary problems.\"); Krause v. Rhodes, \n535 F. Supp. 338, 354 (N.D. Ohio 1979), aff'd, 671 F.2d 212 (6th Cir. 1982) (\"It is not a ground \nfor a  protective order as suggested by deponents' counsel, that the depositions contain hearsay \nanswers or answers whose relevancy or competency might be suspect. The test of the propriety of \na discovery deposition question or answer is not admissibility at trial, nor is admissibility at trial \nthe test for entry of the depositions into the public domain.\"). \n3  Additionally, Ms. Maxwell's reference to issues that were briefed in various undecided motions \nin limine put those motions at issue. Therefore, under the Court's January 13, 2020 Order, these \nmotions should also be unsealed. See Dkt. 1018. \n4   While Ms. Maxwell is correct that the Amodeo II court allowed some portions of a  report \ncontaining hearsay to be sealed, it did so on the basis of specific assertions regarding the material, \nrather than the generalized assertions Ms. Maxwell offers. \n6 \nEFTA00017080\n\ncasQarr.q.6t43-q_cutneobainieAF1195?04(lie713@§kvakklasnibeiVM 10 \nIII. The Specific Objections for Each of the Documents at Issue Also Do Not Justify \nSealing. \nNotwithstanding the 17-page brief submitted by Maxwell, she has failed to identify with \nthe required specificity any countervailing interest sufficient to overcome the substantial \npresumption of access. Instead, Maxwell repeatedly cites generalized concerns and asks the Court \nto broadly continue to seal entire documents based on those generalized concerns. These alleged \n\"countervailing interests\" are wholly insufficient to support the continued sealing of documents in \nthis case. See New York v. Actavis, PLC, No. 14 CIV. 7473, 2014 WL 5353774, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nOct. 21, 2014) (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124) (decisions to seal must be supported by \"specific, \non-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the sealing \norder is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim\"). \nA. Dkt. 143 and Related Submissions \nMs. Maxwell contends that these pleadings all concern Plaintiff's attempt to compel Ms. \nMaxwell to answer intrusive questions about her sex life. However, the related exhibits and \nsubmissions appear to be much broader and include deposition transcripts, a \"Flight Log Summary \nChart\" and flight logs, and police reports. \nNone of the reasons Ms. Maxwell identifies warrants sealing these materials: \n• J. Does 1  and 2  have not asserted any objections with regard to these materials, despite \nreceiving notice and an opportunity to be heard. \n• Sexual content alone is insufficient to justify continued sealing of Ms. Maxwell's \ndeposition transcript. This case concerns allegations of sexual assault and trafficking of \nminors. There is no recognized privacy interest in allegations of sex trafficking. Any \nprivacy interest Ms. Maxwell may have is substantially outweighed by the public interest \n7 \nEFTA00017081\n\ngitga$ij@f916410\nin disclosure, which will shed light on the abuse of young girls and women—and the \nsystem that allowed the abuse to continue. \n• There is no support for Ms. Maxwell's claims that the third-party depositions are \nunreliable. She simply claims that her counsel did not cross-examine the witnesses under \noath. But this is the hearsay standard, not the sealing standard. See Section II.F. \n• Whether Ms. Maxwell is identified as a \"suspect, a perpetrator, or participant\" in the police \nreports is irrelevant to whether the police reports should be unsealed. Additionally, the \npolice reports are public records under Florida's Sunshine Act. See Fla. AG Advisory \nOpinion AGO 80-96 (\"...crime and arrest reports are not exempt from the inspection \nprovisions of the Public Records Law...\"). This lends additional support to the release of \nthese documents in full here. \nB. Dkt. 153-1, Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7 \nMs. Maxwell claims that the third-party depositions are unreliable and inadmissible. Again, \nthis is not the correct standard for sealing. See Section II.F. \nC. Dkt. 172 and Related Submissions \nMs. Maxwell contends that this request was filed for an improper purpose because it could \n\"have been a straightforward request by Plaintiff to exceed the presumptive 10 deposition limit set \nby the Court.\" Dkt. 1057, at 8. What this filing could have been is irrelevant to the Court's analysis: \nThe relevant inquiry turns on what it was. \nMs. Maxwell does not dispute that the Plaintiff made this request to the Court seeking \njudicial action and that the Court acted. The remaining arguments that Ms. Maxwell makes, \nincluding that these are not judicial documents, are all addressed above and/or are non-sequiturs. \nD. Dkt. 199 and Related Submissions \n8 \nEFTA00017082\n\ncasafr.iet43gitsimmenbgirrieAFil4404thelPilskfigawafrcifolilf 10 \nFor the reasons set forth above, there is no basis for continuing to seal these documents. \nSee \nSections II.A, B, C, D. \nFurther, Ms. Maxwell's claim that the Court's ruling on these documents is premature \nbecause they name other third parties who have not yet received notice is inconsistent with the \nCourt's note in Dkt. 1053. There, the Court said that it was \"amenable to unsealing portions of \ndocuments mentioning non-parties rather than waiting to unseal the entirety of a given document \nuntil all non-parties have provided input.\" Intervenors ask that the Court follow the approach set \nforth in Dkt. 1053. \nE. Dkt. 164 and Related \nSubmissions \nIt  appears the Court has received no objections regarding these submissions, and they \nshould be released (as to J. Does 1  and 2). \nF. Dkt. 230 and Related Submissions \nIt  appears the Court has received no objections regarding these submissions, and they \nshould be released (as to J. Does 1  and 2). \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Intervenors respectfully request that this Court unseal in \ntheir entirety Dkt. entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 and their related submissions (as they pertain \nto J. Does 1 and 2). \nDated: New York, New York Respectfully submitted, \nJune \n24, 2020 \nIs/ Christine N. Walz \nSanford L. Bohrer \nChristine N.
