    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of Justice \nFederal Bureau of Prisons \nCentral Office \n320 First St., NW \nWashington, DC 20534 \nJanuary 9, 2020 \nDanielle Ivory \nThe New York Times \n620 Eighth Avenuse \nNew York, NY 10018 \nRequest Number: 2020-01336 \nDear Ms. Ivory: \nThis is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. \nOn 01-02-2020, you submitted a FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). \nA copy of your request is attached. \nAfter reviewing your request, the BOP determined the request should be aggregated \ninto one request, which is request number 2020-01336. This request was made on 12-\n12-2019, which is the date you submitted the earliest request being aggregated. This \nwill ensure you are not disadvantaged by our action. \nDepartment of Justice regulations provide for the aggregation of requests where \"a \ncomponent reasonably believes that a requester...is attempting to divide a single \nrequest into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees....\" The regulation \ncontinues, \"Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a \n30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees.\" 28 C.F.R. § 16.10(h) (2015). \nBOP's decision to aggregate is based on the time both requests were filed and the \ninterrelation of the records sought in each request. We do not know if any fees will be \nassociated with this request and will inform you of any estimated fees prior to us \nsearching for or copying any responsive records. \nRegarding your request for expedited treatment, you provided insufficient information to \nsupport your claim regarding an urgency to inform the public. This Office cannot identify \na particular urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government \nactivity beyond the public's right to know about government activities generally. \nYou provided insufficient information to support your claim you are primarily engaged in \ndisseminating information that would warrant placing your request before all other \nrequests. \nTherefore, your request will be processed in the order in which it was received. \nEFTA00023433\n\nIf you would like to discuss how to make your request less burdensome, please feel free \nto contact the undersigned, this office, or the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) FOIA \nPublic Liaison, , 320 First Street NW, Suite 936, \nWashington DC 20534, o \nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at \nthe National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation \nservices they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of \nGovernment Information, Services, National Archives and Records Administration, \nRoom 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, Colle e Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at \ntelephone at ; toll free at ; or facsimile at \nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively \nappeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States \nDepartment of Justice, Sixth Floor, 441 G St., NW, Washington, DC 20001, or you may \nsubmit an appeal through OIP's FOIAonline portal by creating an account at: \nhttps://www.foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/home. Your appeal must be \npostmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to \nyour request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should \nbe clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\" \nSincerely, \nSupervisory Attorney \nEFTA00023434",
