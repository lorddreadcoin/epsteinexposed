As \nset forth herein, over the course of many years, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, sexually exploited and abused \ndozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and \nPalm Beach, \nFlorida, among other locations. \n2. In particular, \nfrom at least in or about 2002, up to \nand including at least in or \nabout 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and \nrecruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New \nYork (the \"New York \nResidence\") and his estate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida \n(the \"Palm Beach Residence\") to engage in sex acts with \nhim, after which he would give the \nvictims hundreds of dollars \nin cash. \nMoreover, and in order to maintain and increase his \nsupply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid \ncertain of his victims to \nrecruit \nadditional minor girls to be similarly abused by \nEPSTEIN. In this way, EPSTEIN \ncreated a vast network of \nEFTA00021252\n\nunderage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a daily \nbasis, in locations \nincluding New York and Palm Beach. \n3. The \nvictims described herein were as young as 14 years \nold at the time they were abused \nby JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly \nvulnerable to \nexploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN, who \nintentionally sought out \nminors, knew that many of victims were \nin fact under the age of 18, including because, in some \ninstances, victims expressly told him that they were underage. \n4. In creating and maintaining this network of minor \nvictims \nin multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked with \nothers, including \nemployees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among \nother things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual \nencounters with \nEPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the \nPalm \nBeach Residence. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. During all time periods charged \nin this Indictment, \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with multiple \nresidences in the continental United States, including the New \nYork \nResidence and the Palm Beach Residence. \n6. Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and \nrecruited, dozens of minor girls to \nengage in sex acts with him, \n2 \nEFTA00021253\n\nafter which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds \nof dollars in \ncash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. \n7. In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar \nways. Victims were \ninitially recruited to \nprovide \"massages\" to EPSTEIN, which \nwould be performed nude or partially nude, became increasingly \nsexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex \nacts. EPSTEIN paid his victims \nhundreds of dollars in cash for \neach encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively encouraged certain \nof his victims to \nrecruit additional minor girls to be similarly \nsexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims to become \nrecruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars \nfor each minor girl that \nthey brought to EPSTEIN to be sexually \nabused. In so doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new \nvictims to exploit. \nThe New York \nResidence \n8. At all times relevant \nto this Indictment, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story \nprivate residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, \nNew York, \ni.e., the \nNew York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 \nand in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at \nthe New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited \nto engage in sex acts \nwith him, after which EPSTEIN would \nprovide the victims \nwith hundreds of dollars in cash. \n3 \nEFTA00021254\n\n9. When a victim arrived at \nthe New York Residence, she \nwould be escorted to a room with a massage table, where she \nwould \nperform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant. The \nvictims, \nwho were as young as 14 years of age, were told by \nEPSTEIN or other individuals to \npartially or fully undress \nbefore beginning the \"massage.\" \nDuring the encounter, EPSTEIN \nwould escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his \nvictim to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping \nand direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. \nEPSTEIN typically \nwould also masturbate during these sexualized \nencounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, and \ntouch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. \n10. In connection with each \nsexual encounter, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, or one of his employees or associates, \npaid the victim in \ncash. Victims typically were paid hundreds \nof dollars for each encounter. \n11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, \nknew that certain of \nhis \nvictims were underage, including because certain victims \ntold him their age. Further, \nonce these minor victims were \nrecruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent \noccasions at the New York Residence. \nEPSTEIN sometimes \npersonally contacted victims to schedule appointments for \n\"massages\" at the New York Residence. In other instances, \nEPSTEIN directed employees and associates, including a New York-\n4 \nEFTA00021255\n\nbased employee (\"Employee-1\"), to communicate \nwith victims via \nphone to arrange for these victims to return to the \nNew York \nResidence for additional sexual \nencounters with EPSTEIN. \n12. Additionally, and to \nfurther facilitate his ability to \nabuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, \nasked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit additional \nminor girls to perform \"massages\" and \nsimilarly engage in sex \nacts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor \ngirl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim\n-recruiter and the new \nvictim hundreds of dollars \nin cash. Through these victim-\nrecruiters, \nEPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse \ndozens of \nadditional minor girls. \n13. In \nparticular, certain recruiters brought dozens of \nadditional minor girls \nto the New York Residence to give \n\"massages\" to and engage in sex \nacts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional \nminor girls by offering to pay these \nvictim-recruiters for every \nadditional minor girl \nthey brought to EPSTEIN to be sexually \nabused. When a victim-recruiter \naccompanied a new minor victim \nto the New York Residence to be exploited by EPSTEIN, both the \nvictim-recruiter and the new minor \nvictim were paid hundreds of \ndollars by \nEPSTEIN for each encounter. In addition, certain \nvictim-recruiters routinely scheduled these encounters through \n5 \nEFTA00021256\n\nEmployee-1, who sometimes asked the recruiters to bring a \nspecific minor girl for EPSTEIN. \nThe Palm \nBeach Residence \n14. In addition \nto recruiting and abusing minor girls in \nNew York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, created a similar \nnetwork of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, \nwhere EPSTEIN \nowned, possessed and controlled another large \nresidence, i.e., the Palm Beach \nResidence. EPSTEIN frequently \ntraveled from New York to Palm Beach by \nprivate jet, including \non occasions in which an employee or associate would ensure that \nminor victims were \navailable for encounters upon his return to \nFlorida. \n15. At the Palm \nBeach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. \nWhen a victim initially arrived at \nthe Palm Beach Residence, she \nwould be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of \nEPSTEIN's, including, \nat times, two assistants who, as described \nherein, \nwere also responsible for scheduling the sexual \nencounters with minor victims \n(\"Employee-2\" and \"Employee-3\"). \nOnce inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude \nmassage for EPSTEIN, who would himself \ntypically be naked. \nDuring \nthese encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and \nscope of the physical contact to include sex acts such as \ngroping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' \n6 \nEFTA00021257\n\ngenitals. EPSTEIN \nwould also typically masturbate during these \nencounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, and \ntouch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. \n16. In connection with each \nsexual encounter, JEFFREY \nEPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, or one of his employees or associates, \npaid the victim in \ncash. Victims typically were paid hundreds \nof dollars for each encounter. \n17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, \nknew that certain of \nhis \nvictims were underage, including because certain victims \ntold him their age. \nIn addition, as with New York-based \nvictims, many Florida \nvictims, once recruited, were abused by \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on \nmultiple additional \noccasions. \n18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, \nwho during the \nrelevant time \nperiod was frequently in New York, would arrange \nfor Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in \nadvance \nof EPSTEIN's return to Florida to ensure appointments \nwere scheduled for when he \narrived. In particular, in certain \ninstances, Employee-2 placed phone \ncalls to minor victims in \nFlorida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At \nthe time of certain of those phone \ncalls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 \nwere in New York, New York. Additionally, \ncertain of the \nindividuals victimized \nat the Palm Beach Residence were \ncontacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. \n7 \nEFTA00021258\n\n19. \nMoreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady stream of \nminor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the \ndefendant, asked and enticed \ncertain victims in Florida to recruit other minor girls to \nengage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-\nrecruiters for each additional minor girl they brought to the \nPalm Beach Residence to be sexually abused by EPSTEIN. \nSTATUTORY ALLEGATIONS \nCOUNT \nONE \n(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) \n20.
