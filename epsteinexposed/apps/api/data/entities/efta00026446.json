Could you guys do a \nsuper quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today — sorry \nfor the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). \nAlso, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC — please send it back to me. \nThanks, \n<FY20 Request Form- Large Case Related Expenses.docx> \n<FY19 Request Form - Large Case Related Expenses - 650 Fifth Fraud.docx> \nEFTA00026446",
