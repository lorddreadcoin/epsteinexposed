Judge Nathan endorsed that letter with an order that the parties confer and provide another \nupdate letter by Tuesday 12/1. Attached is the defense letter with Judge Nathan's endorsement. \nWould you be available tomorrow (11/25) afternoon to discuss, please? Apologies for the late request, but we are hoping \nto address this before the Thanksgiving holiday. \nThanks very much, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew Y rk NY 10007 \nEFTA00017820",
