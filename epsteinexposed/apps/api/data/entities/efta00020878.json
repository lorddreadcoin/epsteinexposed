I'm actually very surprised. If you still wanted to chat and share what exactly you're looking \nfor, I'd be happy to recommend someone who might be a better fit. \nWith that being said, I just testified earlier this week in a Daubert Hearing for Federal Prosecutor \n  . I'm sure that you might find the hearing transcript of interest at a minimum, and it \nsheds light in the content of my testimony. Similarly, the trial transcript for this case, where I  testified for the \nprosecution: https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/06/10/infamous-danville-sex-trafficking-case-comes-to-trial-\ndefendant-spyder-featured-on-americas-most-wanted/ \nBest, \nKim \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct \n29, 2020, at 10:26 AM, > wrote: \nThanks very much for sending these materials.
