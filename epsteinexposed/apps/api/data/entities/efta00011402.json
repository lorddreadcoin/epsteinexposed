If you could \nsend those early this week? And then we likely can schedule an attorney proffer for later this coming week or the \nfollowing, via phone. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, July 10, 2020 07:20 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: This Epstein accuser is 'ecstatic' over Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest \nThanks M. What is your thinking on scheduling? We need to clear everything with our client.= can send you the \nComplaint by early next week and we can take it from there. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jul 8, 2020, at 16:32, \n) < \n> \nwrote: \nFollowing up on your email below, I believe our last communication was in January 2020, when you advised us that none \nof your nine clients were interested in speaking with the Government—we're happy to hear that view has changed, at \nleast for one of your clients, and we are interested to hear their accounts. At the outset, it would be very helpful for us \nto get some basic threshold information. To help us become familiar with the background, could you please send us the \nlawsuits filed on behalf of your clients? I imagine this is due to my relative unfamiliarity with the New York State online \nfiling system, but I haven't been able to locate those filings. \nAnd then as I mentioned in January, in the first instance, to the extent this is possible, it would be very helpful for us just \nto be provided the names of your client(s)—we would not attempt to contact them outside of our discussions with you, \nof course, but having that information will help us avoid inadvertently approaching individuals who are in fact already \nrepresented, and would also help us identify to you any particular individual(s) who might be known to us already. \nOnce we're able to do a quick review of our current information to gather any relevant information we might already \nhave, the most efficient next step is usually an attorney proffer, so we can talk with you about relevant details first, in \nadvance of any interviews. \nThanks again for reaching out, and we look forward to being in touch. \nBest, \n Original Message \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, July 04, 2020 10:01 \nTo: \nCc \nSubject: Re: This Epstein accuser is 'ecstatic' over Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest \nEFTA00011402\n\nThank you for being in touch, we appreciate it, and I expect we will likely be able to reach out to you this coming week. \nThanks again for following up. \n> On Jul 2, 2020, at 21:01, wrote: \n> \nDear \n> You previously reached out to me but my client is ready to help.
