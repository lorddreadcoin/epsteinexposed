It depends on availability and delivery. Do we have a \ncopy of the data that goes with the drive? \nAlso with the ever changing policies in BOP, can you confirm that they will allow her to have a laptop. Not sure the rules \nat MDC. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct 28, 2020, at 2:22 PM, <> wrote: \nPerfect, thanks so much.

Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we \nwould like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit \nreview of standard files —  word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we \ndid something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a \nhuge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. \nThanks so much—\nEFTA00018626",
