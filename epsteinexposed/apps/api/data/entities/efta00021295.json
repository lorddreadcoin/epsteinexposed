As you are also aware, \nbetween August 10, 2019, and August 16, 2019, at OCME's request and in order to assist OCME \nin determining the cause and manner of Mr. Epstein's death, the \nUSAO \nand FBI gave OCME \naccess to certain materials and information gathering during the Criminal Investigation. \nAs discussed by phone, while the OCME autopsy is now complete, the Criminal \nInvestigation remains ongoing. As such, and in order to avoid compromising the Criminal \nInvestigation, we request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party any documents, \nevidence or information made available to OCME by the \nUSAO \nor FBI—including documents, \nrecords, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within the OCME case file that \ninclude, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the \nUSAO \nor FBI. We also \nrequest that you withhold from any disclosure the names and identifying information of any federal \nlaw enforcement agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the \nsubstance of any statements or interviews made by those agents or employees. \nEFTA00021295\n\nPage 2 \nWe appreciate your willingness to comply with this request. Should you decide at any \nfuture point, notwithstanding this request, to produce any of the above-referenced material to any \nthird party, we request that you notify us before you do so, so that we may seek additional process. \nPlease contact us with any further questions. \nVery \ntruly yours, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nby: /s/ \nEFTA00021296",
