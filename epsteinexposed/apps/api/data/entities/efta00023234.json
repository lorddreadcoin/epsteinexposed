Was this trip booked through CWT by phone \nor online? If either scenario, I'll need the cancelled record locator to see if it's refundable, and ask them to send me a \ndocument stating it was refunded to your government travel card. Thanks. \nU.S. Attorney's Office (SDNY) \nLegal Assistant, Public Corruption \nFrom: \nSent: Sunday, May 26, 2019 2:31 PM \nTo: \nSubject: FW: travel approval request \nEFTA00023234\n\nHi \nI have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this \nweekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate \nthe reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different \nreservations—I'm sorry about that!). \nBecause I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, • approved my second leg flight to go \nstraight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are: \nTuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI \n- JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) \nTuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach \n- Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 \nThursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) \n- Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. \nIf these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day \nbefore to at least make the reservations. \nLast question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because \nthere were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back \nto New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? \nPlease let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 21:24 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nApproved \nSent from my iPad \nOn May 24, 2019, at 7:21 PM, \n> \nwrote: \n-- I have previously-scheduled travel to San Francisco next Thursday for a wedding, and the way our victims have \nasked to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to \nend on Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just \nbook the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a  5:30 \na.m. flight but that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any \ninconvenience but wanted to check —thank you! \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 16:01 \nEFTA00023235\n\nTo: \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nThanks • —  have a great weekend. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, May 24, 2019 15:55 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nAll approved. \nSent from my iPad \nOn May 24, 2019, at 2:57 PM, \nS \n> \nwrote: \nAgain in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately \nthree days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly \ndown Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling \nallows). \nUnfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will \neither be me and or and but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't \ndoing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to \nreserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. \nthanks very much, \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 20:57 \nTo: \nSubject: RE: travel approval request \nThank \nyou \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 20:46 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: travel approval request \nApproved \nSent from my iPad \nOn Apr 3, 2019, at 8:02 PM, wrote: \nEFTA00023236\n\nFor the same case as below, United States v.
