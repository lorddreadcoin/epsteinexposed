    "text": "\n\nGood afternoon, my name is Geoffrey Berman, I am the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District \nof New York. Almost exactly one year ago today, I announced a two-count indictment of Jeffrey \nEpstein by this Office for sexually abusing young girls. \nA lot has changed since then. \nRather than face criminal prosecution, Epstein chose — as he so often did — to act selfishly, by \ntaking his own life just mere feet from here in the shadow of the very building where we \nannounced his indictment. Immediately after Epstein committed his final act of cowardice, I \nannounced that the search for those who enabled his hideous conduct would not end. And it \nhas not. \nEpstein's suicide could not extinguish the voices or resolve of his victims, he only emboldened \nthem. Rather than let him have the final word, they chose to speak. Loudly. And with their help, \nI am announcing the indictment of Ghislaine Maxwell, for [enumerate charges and detail her \nconduct] for her alleged connection to the sex crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. \nThis case has been attention-getting and polarizing for so many reasons, the least of which is \nthat the victims of Epstein and Maxwell refuse to remain in the shadows, and their courage and \ndetermination have been critical in bringing today's charges. These women have found their \nvoice and I hope serve as examples for other victims of abuse to come forward. Your voices are \nbeing heard and you no longer need to remain in the shadows of abuse. These women deserve \nrespect, empathy, compassion, and most of all, justice. \nAs we stand in front of the historic federal courthouse, I'll conclude by saying that today's \ncharges remind us: no matter how wealthy, powerful, or well-connected you may be, justice is \nblind in the eyes of the law, and if you abuse young women in this District, you will face justice. \nEFTA00029807",
