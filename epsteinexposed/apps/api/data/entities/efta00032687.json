NJ 07640 \nReply to Newark Off ice [X] \nOf Counsel \nDouglas Mitchell. Esq. \nLinda Childs, Esq. \nSENT VIA ECF \nHonorable Analisa Torres \nU.S. \nSouthern District of NY \n500 Pearl Street \nNew York, NY 10007 \n30 Wall Street P Floor \nNew York, NY 1005 \nRe: USA v Michael Thomas, et al. \nDocket No.: 1:19-cr-00830 \nAddendum to Letter Brief in Support of Deferred Prosecution \nYour Honor, \nPlease accept this addendum as a supplement to my letter brief, in support of Mr. Michael \nThomas' Application for Deferred Prosecution. \n1. Additional Adverse Impacts \nMr. Thomas' life has spiraled down-hill ever since losing his livelihood and reputation \nafter being charged in this case. Most notably Mr. Thomas this prosecution has caused Mr. \nThomas to suffer extreme anxiety and depression. Prior to the events in this case, Mr. Thomas \nwas in precarious financial situation, that required him to work as much overtime as possible to \nEFTA00032687\n\nmeet his financial obligations. Subsequently, Mr. Thomas has no money to support himself. His \nbills are all past-due and he sees his family, including his children, less than before. He feels a \ntremendous amount of guilt and embarrassment because of his actions. This had led him to rarely \ngoing out in public and distancing himself from friends and family. Prior to this incident, Mr. \nThomas was well liked and popular among his co-workers at MCC. Many have reached out to \nshow support and check on his well-being however, Mr. Thomas's depression has prevented him \nfrom strengthening those relationships. \nAdditionally, Mr. Thomas is deeply affected by the publicity this case has created. This \nhas made it virtually impossible for him to secure another job to support himself and his \nchildren. Moreover, in almost all the instances wherein he has tried to get another job he has \nbeen recognized. Once he fills out an application with work history wherein, he includes working \nat MCC, employers recognize him as \"  the guard who fell asleep on the job.\" Alternatively, if he \nattempts to hide his previous employment, he has nothing to put on the application for the last 16 \nyears as to his recent employment which also becomes a huge red flag to potential employers. As \na  result, Mr. Thomas has not been able to secure any employment since losing his job at the \nMCC. \n2. Factors that merit leniency \nThere are several factors that militate toward the government showing leniency in this \ncase. Most notably, as previously mentioned, Mr. Thomas has strong record of service to his \ncountry in the armed services. Anyone who serves out country deserves our thanks and praise; \nhowever, Mr. Thomas' experience was different than many others. Mr. Thomas' military service \nentailed being involved in live action combat where he saw people killed and severely injured. \nEFTA00032688\n\nMr. Thomas knows what dead bodies smell and look like. This experience has had lasting mental \neffects on Mr. Thomas that he has not shared with anyone. \n3. Events in Question \nPrior to being charged in this case, Mr. Thomas immediately revealed what happened the \nnight Mr. Epstein died to prosecutors via his attorney. On August 10, 2019, Mr. Thomas reported \nto the midnight shift to work overtime after working multiple overtime shifts in addition to his \nregular full time shifts in the days and hours preceding this time. He checked in, signed onto the \ncomputer system, and handled some preliminary paperwork for the upcoming shift. He \nremembers briefly going online to check some sports scores and look at some classifieds. He \nbelieves that he was on the Internet for well under one hour's time. The next thing he remembers \nis being awakened around 5:00am by the arrival of the morning food cart. Commotion ensued \nand he immediately rushed to check on the inmates, at which time he found Mr. Epstein hanging \nin his cell. \nMr. Thomas has always maintained that he worked himself too hard and that he was too \ntired when he showed up to that midnight shift. He had worked an excessive number of shifts \nwithout adequate sleep and rest. As previously discussed, Mr. Thomas was not working the \nmultiple over-time shifts out of greed or to save for a boat. He worked the additional shifts to pay \nhis rent and child support which required the overtime income. It bears noting to any lay person \nlooking at the schedule worked by Mr. Thomas, that it  would be impossible for him effectively \ndischarge his employment duties. Nonetheless, the administration and the culture of the MCC \nnot only allowed this behavior but in many instances encouraged and required it. \nEFTA00032689\n\n4. Acceptance of responsibility \nAt approximately 6:00am in the morning immediately following Mr. Thomas attempting \nlifesaving CPR on Jeffrey Epstein, it  has been reported that Mr. Thomas immediately accepted \nresponsibility for his actions. He has never wavered from acknowledging his wrongdoing and the \nmistakes that he has made. Indeed, from all accounts, it appears that Mr. Thomas alone has stood \nup and acknowledged his failure. This incident could not have happened unless many others also \nfailed in the duties but there seems to be little information of anyone other than Mr. Thomas \naccepting responsibility for this tragedy. \n5. \nCooperation \nMr. Thomas is the only person who saw Jeffrey Epstein hanging in his cell. Mr. Thomas \nis one of a very few people to have lengthy conversations with Jeffrey Epstein prior to his death. \nMr. Thomas will cooperate with all government agencies if this case is resolved with a deferred \nprosecution. \nLAW OFFICES OF MONTELL FIGGINS, LLC \nMontell Figgins, Esq. \nAttorneys for Defendant Michael Thomas \nEFTA00032690",
