Apologies for the delay, I really struggled with this one. I think our \narguments in the first half are strong, but I'm really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your \ncomments/edits. I've also flagged a few issues for consideration/discussion. If you're able to review tomorrow morning, \nthat would be great. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00025194",
