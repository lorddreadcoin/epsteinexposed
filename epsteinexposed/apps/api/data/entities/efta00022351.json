London papers roundup. \nU.S. Department \nofJustice Attach€ \nU.S. Embassy London \nU.K. Mobile: \nFrom the U.S.: \nFrom: Press Office, U.S. Embassy London \nSent: \nTuesday. \nJune 9.2020 9:21 AM \nTo: \nSubject: The SW11, Tuesday, June 9, 2020 \nYour daily digest of top UK news stories from U.S. Embassy London Public Affairs \nThe SW11 \nJune 9, 2020 \nWhat the Papers Say \nMost headlines are leading with Prince Andrew and his involvement in \nthe Epstein inquiry. Telegraph writes \"In the latest twist in the saga \nconcerning Prince Andrew's links to the billionaire paedophile, the \nDuke's legal team insisted he had offered to speak to the US authorities \nEFTA00022351\n\n\"on at least three occasions this year\". Revealing the Department of \nJustice (DoJ) had confirmed that the Duke \"is not and never has been a \ntarget of their criminal investigations into Epstein\", the statement by \nBlackfords law firm accused US prosecutors of \"seeking publicity rather \nthan accepting the assistance proffered.\" The Daily Mail say ' In \nchallenging the veracity of America's Department of Justice, which has \naccused him of refusing to cooperate with its investigation into Epstein's \nsex-trafficking network, he is taking on the most powerful law agency in \nthe world. And in a further twist last night, U.S. authorities responded \nto the Prince's intervention. In a statement, the Justice Department said \nAndrew had sought to 'falsely portray' himself as a  willing participant in \ntheir inquiry and said he had 'repeatedly declined' to be interviewed. In \nother news, The Times leads with the toppling of the Colston statue by \nantiracism protestors. \"The home secretary had a 'firm' conversation \nyesterday with Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset, \nand demanded an explanation for what had happened in Bristol on \nSunday. She made clear that she expected those who pulled the statue \ndown to face criminal prosecution. There have been no arrests so far\". \nThe Guardian says \"Conservative group leader, Mark Weston, who called \nit \"a wanton act\". Bristol's mayor, Marvin Rees, the son of a Jamaican \nmigrant, said that although the statue had been an \"affront\" throughout \nhis life, he could not \"condone criminal damage\". \"But at the time, \nseveral of those present told the Guardian, the mood was not \nvandalistic but righteous. After all, more formal attempts to bring about \nthe figure's removal had become so bogged down that even an attempt \nto affix a new plaque to better reflect Colston's history had been \ndelayed indefinitely\". \nThe FTwrites, \"more than half of Boris Johnson's cabinet are pushing for \nDowning Street to cut the two-metre social distancing rule to contain \ncoronavirus, in a move that would provide a huge boost to the \nhospitality industry\".   City H.M.  reports, \"Tory MPs have blasted Huawei's \nUK media blitz as a \"ridiculous\" attempt to gain British sympathy, amid \nincreasing pressure for Boris Johnson to cut ties with the Chinese \ntechnology firm. In an open letter to the British public Huawei today \nemphasised its commitment to the UK over the past two decades and its \ncredibility as a telecoms provider. 'For nearly 20 years, we've supplied \nthe UK's mobile and broadband companies with 3G and 4G. But some \nnow question our role in helping Britain lead the way in 5G,' it said\". The \nIndependent  says, \"Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing \nthat it was still \"our current working plan\" that they will not reopen \nuntil September \"at the earliest\". \"On Tuesday, Boris Johnson will speak \nto his Cabinet before the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, delivers \na  statement to Parliament on the wider reopening of schools\". \nAccording to The Times  \"Boris Johnson has been urged to offer all Hong \nKong residents the right to live in the UK to show that Britain is \nEFTA00022352\n\n\"serious\" about its obligations to the territory. The prime minister, who \nhas promised to give three million Hong Kong citizens extended visa-free \naccess, was told by senior Tories that he should allow them to remain \npermanently. \nEditorial: Question \nTime: The Duke of York \nhas a moral obligation \nto assist US law \nenforcement agencies -\nTimes \nJonathan Saxty: Brexit \nBritain has a much \nbetter alternative than \nthe EU: Canzuk -\nTelegraph \nJane Dalton: Boris \nJohnson is dropping his \npromise not to import \nchlorinated chicken \nafter Brexit.
