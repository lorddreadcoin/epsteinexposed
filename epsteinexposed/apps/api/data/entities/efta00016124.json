Marra is now considering the \npossible remedies for the violation, which could potentially include tearing up the non-prosecutions agreement. \nEpstein, 66 -- who at one time socialized with former President Bill Clinton, Great Britain's Prince Andrew and President \nDonald Trump -- was arrested on July 6 for alleged sex trafficking of minor girls in Florida and New York. Some of the \ncharges date back to the early 2000s. \nEFTA00016124\n\nHe was indicted on a child sex trafficking and conspiracy charges in which prosecutors charge that he \"sexually exploited \nand abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations,\" \nusing cash payments to recruit a \"vast network of underage victims,\" some of whom were as young as 14 years old. \nEpstein has pleaded not guilty to the latest charges and his defense attorneys have argued in court that the new \nindictment is tantamount to \"double jeopardy,\" the constitutional right that prevents a person from being tried on the \nsame (or similar) charges twice, based on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. \n\"It is our belief that this is basically a  re-do,\" Epstein defense attorney Reid Weingarten told the judge at a bail hearing \nearlier this month. \"This is basically the feds today, not happy with what happened in the decision that led to the NPA, \nredoing the same conduct that was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. \nWe think that is the heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our defense.\" \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors claimed Epstein tried to buy off potential witnesses and charged that he had \ndemonstrated a  \"willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation.\" \nProsecutors allege that late last year Epstein wired $100,000 from a trust account to a person who had been named in the \n2008 case as a possible co-conspirator of Epstein's and then three days later wired $250,000 to another suspected co-\nconspirator. \nWeingarten did not respond at the time to an ABC News request for comment on prosecutors' claims of potential witness \ntampering. \nWhat Jail Is Like for Jeffrey Epstein \nWall Street Journal \nBy Ben Chapman \n7/27/19 \nNow sleeping in the bottom bunk of a windowless 8-by-8-foot cell, the financier earlier was denied house arrest at his \nsprawling Manhattan townhouse \nSince his arrest on sex-trafficking charges, financier Jeffrey Epstein has spent much of his time in the bottom bunk of a \nwindowless 8-by-8-foot cell, according to the lawyer of his former cellmate. \nThe cell is in a wing of a  federal jail in downtown Manhattan that is known as \"the box\" and has been the subject of \ninmate complaints about mice and insect infestations, as well as standing water on the floor, according to lawyers of \ninmates. \nMr. Epstein's roommate until Tuesday was Nicholas Tartaglione, a retired police officer accused of killing four people, \naccording to Mr. Tartaglione's lawyer, Bruce Barket. \n\"It is dark and it's disgusting,\" Mr. Barket said of the jail cell Messrs. Epstein and Tartaglione shared. \nMr. Epstein, 66 years old, was arrested July 6 and was later denied bail when a judge rejected his lawyers' request that he \nbe placed on house arrest in his sprawling Manhattan townhouse, which is valued at $77 million. \nMr. Epstein had built a fortune of more than half a billion dollars by cultivating his ties to rich and powerful individuals. \nProsecutors this month said they found a \"piles of cash\" and dozens of diamonds in a locked safe at his New York \nmansion. \nThe financier has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a yearslong \nscheme from 2002 to 2005 to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls. \nEFTA00016125\n\nFollowing his arrest, he has mostly been at the Manhattan jail, which is known as the Metropolitan Correctional Center. \nHe was moved to a suicide-watch unit after being found unconscious in his cell Tuesday morning, according to people \nfamiliar with the matter. \nA lawyer for Mr. Epstein declined to comment. Mr. Tartaglione was interviewed in connection with Mr. Epstein's injuries \nbut had no part in them, Mr. Barket said. \nThe jail houses 774 inmates, most of them awaiting trial. It has been home to such high-profile inmates as Mexican drug \nlord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison. \nFederal records show that the current occupants include Cesar Sayoc, who pleaded guilty to sending bombs to prominent \nDemocrats and is awaiting sentencing, and Sayfullo Saipov, accused of killing eight people by driving a truck on to a \nManhattan bike path. Mr. Saipov has pleaded not guilty. \nMr. Epstein and other inmates are allowed to leave their cells for an hour of recreation each day, as well as meetings with \nlawyers, according to a correction officer. \nMr. Barket said that Messrs. Tartaglione and Epstein were friendly and frequently spoke while they were bunkmates. Mr. \nTartaglione was arrested in 2016 for killing four people in Chester, N.Y. He has pleaded not guilty. \nMr. Tartaglione's lawyer has been a vocal critic of the conditions in the jail, filing complaints to correction officials about \nrodents and bugs. \nLawyers for Mr. Guzman blamed frigid temperatures, lack of clean blankets and contaminated water at the jail as reasons \nfor their client's failing health. \nSerene Gregg, a case worker at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and president of the correction workers' union \nchapter, said there are mice and broken toilets and sinks. \nRepresentatives for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which manages the Metropolitan Correctional Center, didn't respond to \nquestions about the conditions there. \n\"There is no worse place you can find yourself,\" Mr. Barket said. \nLawmaker says she was warned to back off Jeffrey Epstein case: 'Little girl, you don't know what you're getting into' \nTampa Bay Times \nBy Miami Herald \n7/26/19 \nFlorida Sen. Lauren Book has reached out to Capitol police after receiving an anonymous warning connected to her \ndemand for a state inquiry into Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw's handling of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's \nlenient work release program, the Miami Herald has learned. \nBook, a vocal advocate for child sexual assault survivors, said she also received more than a dozen calls from Bradshaw's \npolitical supporters asking her to back off on her call for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement \ninto Bradshaw. \nOn Monday, Book, a Democrat, wrote a letter to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis asking him to authorize a probe into how \nEpstein, accused of molesting dozens of underage girls and a registered sex offender, was permitted to leave the Palm \nBeach County Jail and spend much of his 2008-2009 incarceration in an office in West Palm Beach. \nEFTA00016126\n\nDeSantis said Thursday after a Cabinet meeting that he would \"certainly consider\" an investigation but that he has yet to \ndecide how the state should respond. \n\"I saw someone sent me a letter. I looked at it,\" he said. \"I've got to figure out what the proper role of FDLE [is). I know \nthey are investigating it down in Palm Beach.... Clearly when you look at how that happened, if even like 10 percent of \nthe things about him are true, then that whole agreement was obviously suspect and willfully below what he should have \nfaced.\" \nWhile the governor was still weighing the merits of the senator's request, the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office issued a new \nstatement that its previously announced internal affairs investigation of the deputies who guarded and supervised Epstein \nduring his work release had become a criminal investigation as well. No further elaboration was provided. \nMeanwhile, Book, in an interview with the Herald, said she had asked the Capitol police, who handle security for state \nlawmakers, to look into claims made on a Russian website alleging that Bradshaw was behind an effort to access her \nphone and emails by using the pretext of \"imminent danger\" to obtain her personal information. \n\"I've received countless phone calls saying 'Little girl you don't know what you're getting into; and telling me that I should \njust stop;' said Book, a child sexual abuse survivor herself who has worked to pass strict sex offender laws in Florida. \nIn a statement, the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office said it had no knowledge of anyone trying to threaten or pressure Book. \n\"Nor has (the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office) made any effort to access her phone or emails as alleged on a salacious website \nrun by a disgruntled former employee;' the statement said. \nPbsotalk.org, the website in question, is a blog tied to a former Palm Beach sheriff's deputy who moved to Russia after \nstarting the site, which claims it is dedicated to exposing corruption in the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office. The former deputy, \nJohn Dougan, fled to Moscow in 2016 following an FBI raid on his Palm Beach home that he claims was politically \nmotivated. \nThe pressure against Book came on the same day that Epstein, 66, was found injured in his cell at the Metropolitan \nCorrectional Center in New York, where he is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges brought earlier this month by the \nU.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. His arrest stemmed from alleged behavior with underage girls dating \nback more than a decade in New York and Florida. Epstein was taken into custody July 6 after arriving at New Jersey's \nTeterboro Airport from Paris on his private jet. \nEpstein was found unconscious in his cell Wednesday evening amid speculation that he may have tried to commit suicide \nor been attacked by another inmate. Jail officials said he was in the lockup Thursday. \nLast Friday, Bradshaw announced the internal affairs investigation after reports emerged that Epstein — while on work \nrelease in Palm Beach — was allowed female visitors to his office, including at least one visit that led to a sexual \nencounter. The terms of Epstein's incarceration were detailed by the Herald as part of a series published last year about \nEpstein's case, Perversion of Justice. \nwho represents several of Epstein's victims, said it is ludicrous to think that Bradshaw is able to investigate \nhis own department. \n\"The allegations are against the sheriff and there's no way a credible investigation can be conducted by the sheriff's office \nwhen the allegations extend to the very top of the organization;' said. \nBook, whose father, Ron Book, is perhaps the most powerful lobbyist in Florida, said she intends to pressure the governor \nfor a  full and thorough investigation. \n\"The privileges that Epstein received in Palm Beach County were outside the scope of what anyone else would receive. \nWe need an independent body to identify whether this was an issue of individual failures or systemic failures. And if it was \nEFTA00016127\n\nan individual failure, we need to hold those individuals accountable,\" she said. \nBradshaw, who is running for his fifth term, wields tremendous power in Palm Beach, where the agency has also been the \nlead law enforcement detail assisting the Secret Service during President Donald Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago. The Palm \nBeach Sheriff's Office spent $5.6 million for Trump's 2017-2018 trips, the Palm Beach Post reported in April. The \ndepartment is reimbursed for the work. \nEpstein was found on the floor of his jail cell with injuries to his neck, according to a report from NBC New York late \nWednesday. \nThe television station said another inmate had been questioned and that Epstein is on suicide watch. A source told CBS \nNews the injuries were not life threatening. The New York Post reported that Epstein was taken to a  nearby hospital and \nmay have intentionally hurt himself in order to win a transfer out of the federal facility. \nQuoting unnamed law enforcement officials, The New York Times said prison officials were treating the incident, which \nleft Epstein with \"bruising around the neck,\" as a possible suicide attempt. \nThe jet-setting financier was denied bail last week after a federal judge said he posed a  danger to young women. His \nlawyers have filed their intent to appeal, saying he should be released to his palatial Upper East Side Manhattan \ntownhouse. \nEpstein, who has pleaded not guilty, roamed the halls of power before dozens of underage girls accused him of sexual \nassaults. After preparing a 50-plus-page indictment on sex trafficking charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida shelved the charges and allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in state court. That's how \nEpstein ended up in the Palm Beach County Jail —  and then on work release approved by Sheriff Bradshaw. \nA fixture on the high-society social circuit, he was known to associate with figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and \nPrince Andrew of Britain. He owns homes around the world, including a mansion in Palm Beach. His lawyers pegged his \nwealth at $559 million in court documents. \nIn an email, the Bureau of Prisons said Epstein was currently at the federal jail Thursday morning, not a hospital, but did \nnot address his condition or whether an incident had occurred. \n\"As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their \nconditions of confinement,\" the Bureau of Prisons said. \nThe federal detention center where Epstein is locked up has been described by The New York Times as \"less hospitable \nthan Guantanamo Bay.\" It has also held Joaquin Guzman Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, Ponzi schemer \nBernie Madoff and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who plotted the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, according to the Times. \nThis story was written by Miami Herald staff writers Julie K. Brown and Nicholas Nehamas. Times/Herald Tallahassee \nBureau staff writer Elizabeth Koh contributed to this report. \nOne of the earliest known accusations against Jeffrey Epstein was reported to Santa Monica police in 1997 \nInsider \nBy Kat Tenbarge \n7/26/19 \nIn a police report obtained by The New York Times and published Thursday, a then-27-year-old model named \naccused the wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein of a now all-too-familiar sequence of events resulting in what Santa Monica, \nCalifornia, officers classified as sexual battery. \nEFTA00016128\n\nEpstein, who registered as a sex offender after a  2008 case, is being held without bail in the Southern District of New York \non charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy involving dozens of underage girls from at least 2002 to 2005. \nEpstein has pleaded not guilty. \nThe newly unearthed police report is one of the earliest known accusations against the financier— iled her \naccusation with the Santa Monica Police Department in May 1997. \nIn that accusation, .M said Epstein identified himself as a talent scout for Victoria's Secret before inviting her to a hotel \nroom in Santa Monica for an interview that was told could have landed her a spot in the lingerie company's catalog. \ntold the police she \"started having reservations\" before her appointment with Epstein, because \"generally, \ninterviews are not conducted in hotel rooms.\" \nRead more: How Jeffrey Epstein, the mysterious hedge-fund manager arrested on sex-trafficking charges, made his \nfortune \nWhen met Epstein in the hotel room for her interview, she told the police, she was \"unsure of whether she was \nsafe\" because he \"was attempting to get her to act in an unprofessional manner for a  model.\" She said that included \nEpstein asking her to undress, twice, and on the second time pulling her blouse and skirt up and groping her buttocks \nwhile saying, \"Let me manhandle you for a second.\" \nM\ntold The Times she fled in tears and went to the police the next day. She put her report on the record a week later, \nworried that Epstein, whose hands she called \"weopons,\" would use his Victoria's Secret connection to assault other \nwomen. \nAccusations from other women include descriptions of similar tactics. A former Italian model named aid \nEpstein also used his Victoria's Secret connection to attempt to coerce her into sex acts in 2004. \nWhat's more, The Times reported that two senior executives at L Brands, the company owned by Epstein's only known \nfinancial-services client and then friend knew Epstein was posing as a Victoria's Secret talent scout. L Brands \nwas, and still is, the parent company of Victoria's Secret. \nThe Times cited the two unnamed former executives as saying they had learned in the mid-1990s that Epstein, then \nserving asll financial adviser, was pitching himself to women as a  recruiter for the Victoria's Secret catalog. The \ntwo executives signed nondisclosure agreements while working for but told The Times he was made aware that \nEpstein was posing as a Victoria's Secret talent scout. \npromised to take care of the situation at the time, the executives said, but theremained \nextraordinarily close with Epstein until 18 months after Epstein was charged with an array of sexual misconduct in Palm \nBeach, Florida. After pleading guilty to state prostitution charges in that case, Epstein is now facing new charges accusing \nhim of trafficking girls as young as 14. \nIn a letter to L Brands employees this month about the new charges, said he was \"NEVER aware of the illegal \nactivity charged in the indictment\" and \"would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago \ncould have caused such pain to so many people.\" \nThat being said, the relationship between and Epstein was extensive, with The Times reporting that \ntransferred Epstein's Manhattan mansion, private 727 Boeing jet, and Ohio estate to him from his and L Brands' previous \nassets and that he gave Epstein full control over all his finances from 1991 to 2007. \nEFTA00016129",
