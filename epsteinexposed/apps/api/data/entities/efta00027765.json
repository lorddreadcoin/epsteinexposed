Also, she plans to make the \nphone calls we discussed today and tomorrow on her own. She will contact me once she has connected with two \nindividuals she's reaching out to and I will reach out to you in turn. \nHappy to discuss anything, if that's helpful. \nThanks, \nAlex \nAlex Conlon I  Kaplan Hecker \n& \nFink LLP \n(W) nol:n \nEFTA00027765\n\nI(M) nel:› \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, May 14 2019 4:49 PM \nTo: Alex Conlon \nCc: Alexandra Elenowitz-Hess \nAlex, \nSubject: RE: SDNY investigation /  interview \nJust tried calling but missed you — wanted to briefly follow up on our conversation last week to let you know that \nwe certainly don't have an ob'ection to someone from your firm (whether attorney or staff) taking notes in \nconnection with Ms. conversations to tell the individuals we discussed that our office is interested in \nspeaking with them. I expect we might request a copy of the notes, and, as discussed, whoever is with her would \nbe a potential, theoretical witness, but no issue on our end with any of that. \nSeparately, if it's possible, could you please ask Ms. if there is a time next week or the following that \nwe could meet with her? We're hoping to cover all the information we need to in this first set of discussions \nbefore June, when I think it will be even more inconvenient for her to meet. I expect the next meethir, \naddress difficult topics, including Giglio subjects and some review of Epstein's conduct with Ms. in \nparticular; but, I also expect that once we get through those issues, we won't need to meet with her again for at \nleast a little while. \nWe can generally make ourselves available whenever works on her end, with some combination of our team \n(e.g., if it's the latter half of next week, will likely be me and our new team member , but let us know if \nthere are any issues with that), and as always can work around her schedule. And happy to come to your office \nfor the final push. \nDon't hesitate to give a call if any other info would be helpful, or if any questions or issues, and thanks very \nmuch. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nThis email and its attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or protected from disclosure by \nthe attorney-client, work product or other applicable legal privilege.
