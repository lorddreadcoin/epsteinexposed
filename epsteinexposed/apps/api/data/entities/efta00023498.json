Isn't this something that you all \nwould have a copy of from when you scanned our files? Just trying to track it down. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, February 17, 2021 7:45 PM \nTo: \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: Question re SDFL Epstein file \nHi \nHope you're doing well. We have a small follow-up question about the Jeffrey Epstein file. I'm attaching a privilege log \nfiled by your office in connection with the CVRA lawsuit. We were hoping you might be able to send us the item on page 5 \nof the log, which has the following description: \"File folder entitled se (N.Y. AUSA)\" containing attorney \n() handwritten notes.\" The log gives the following identifiers for the document: \"Box tfl P-003679 Thru P-\n003680.\" \nThanks very much —  we're currently briefing an issue relating to this, so we really appreciate your help. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00023498",
