I'm sure I've missed some items, but this is a starting point at a  least. \nFor context, I think we currently expect to call at least the following witnesses at trial: \n>; \n•  *Records custodian from Interlochen \n•  *Records custodian from the Professional Children's School \n•  *Court reporter(s) from GM depositions \n*We haven't identified/spoken to these witnesses yet, so that's on the trial prep to-do list as well. \nThe following are some potential next steps —  either individuals to interview or re-interview, records to search for/identify, \nand so forth. \n•  Relativity review of GM emails \n•  Identify an Interlochen employee (likely retired) who managed donor relations with Epstein/can authenticate \ndocuments \n•  Identify a PBPD detective who can authenticate items recovered from search of PB house \n•  Talk to to make sure I. has searched all her emails for relevant communications \n•  Potentially interview \n•  Potentially re-interview \n•  Meet with \n•  Interview \n•  Interview \n•  Interview Jo Jo Fontanella \n•  Re-interview \nclient \nEFTA00027435\n\n•  Interview and \n•  Review victim interview notes and interview any outcry witnesses we haven't spoken to yet, including \n•  Interview mother \n•  Investigate immigration records/travel records re: \n•  Re-interview IM (with counsel) \n•  Interview. \n•  Review deposition transcripts for GM (keeping in mind IMI is approaching) \n•  Tip-line leads that flagged \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00027436",
