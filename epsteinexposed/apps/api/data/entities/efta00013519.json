    "text": "\n\nIN RE: \nINVESTIGATION OF \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN \nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT \nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 of the \nNon-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter \"paragraph 7\"), that agreement is modified as follows: \n7A. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility for \nconsulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney \nrepresentative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the United States elects to assign \nthis responsibility to an independent third-party, both the United States and Epstein retain the right to \nmake good faith objections to the attorney representative suggested by the independent third-party prior \nto the final designation of the attorney representative. \n7B. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party regarding \nthe role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to pay such attorney \nrepresentative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing such victims subject to the \nprovisions of paragraph C, infra. \n7C. Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney \nrepresentative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not obligate \nEpstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of \npotential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s \n2255 or elects to pursue any other \ncontested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay \nthe costs of the \nattorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay \nreasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney \nrepresentative, \nshall cease. \nBy signing this Addendum, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and explained \nto him. Epstein hereby states that he understands the clarifications to the Non-Prosecution Agreement \nand \nagrees to comply with them. \nR.
