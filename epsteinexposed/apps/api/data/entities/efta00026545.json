    "text": "\n\nU.S. Department of \nJustice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n300 \nQuarropas \nSower \nWhite Plains. New York 1060! \nJanuary 8, 2020 \nBY ECF \nThe Honorable Kenneth M. Karas \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \n300 Quarropas Street \nWhite Plains, NY 10601 \nRe: United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) \nDear Judge Karas: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court \nregarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the \nMetropolitan Correctional Center (\"MCC\") on July 22 —  July 23, 2019 (the \"Requested Video\"). \nOn or about December 19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it \nhad confirmed with MCC staff that the Requested Video had been preserved, and that the \nGovernment was working to obtain a copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the \nGovernment has learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within \nthe MCC, and, as a result, video from outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 2019 no longer \nexists. \nOn or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded \nto the cell (\"Cell-1\") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, \ndefense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from \nJuly 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal \ncounsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked \nup the defendant's cell in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC staff \npreserve video from outside of the cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member \nconfirmed that the video had been preserved. \nOn or about January 3, 2020, the Government obtained a  copy of the Requested Video \nfrom the MCC, and converted it into a playable format. After reviewing the video, it appeared to \nthe Government that the footage contained on the Requested Video was for the correct date and \ntime, but captured a  different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located because the Requested \nVideo did not show corrections officers responding to any of the cells seen on the video. After \nspeaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government understands that the MCC computer system \nincorrectly listed the defendant's cell for the time period in question (\"Cell-2\"). Therefore, when \nEFTA00026545\n\nJanuary 8, 2020 \nPage 2 of 2 \nMCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be preserved, the MCC \npreserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1. \nThe Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that the only other \nsource of video from outside of Cell-1 would be on the DVR system that housed all video for the \nSpecial Housing Unit (the \"SHU\"). Following the death of \nJeffrey \nEpstein at the MCC on or about \nAugust 10, 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") seized the DVR. The Government \nunderstands from speaking with an FBI agent that the FBI seized two DVR systems: one that \ncaptured video from the common area of the SHU, and one that captured the SHU tiers (the \"Tier \nDVR\"), including the tier where Cell-1 is located. The Government further understands that the \nFBI has determined that, on or about July 29, 2019, the Tier DVR suffered a system failure. As a \nresult, the FBI been unable to recover any footage from the Tier DVR, and is unlikely to recover \nany video. \nRespectfully submitted, \nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN \nUnited States Attorney \nBy:  Is/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nCc: Counsel \nof record (by ECF) \nEFTA00026546",
