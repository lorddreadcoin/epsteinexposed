In light of \na recent request, can we please review your notes from inmates in the SHU on the date of the attempted suicide to \ndetermine if there are any inmates who gave statements that corroborate Tartaglione's account that he saved Epstein's \nlife? We think this could arguably be penalty-phase Brady, so we'd like to review this in the first instance, and then discuss \nwith you any disclosures we think need to be made. \nCo-Chief, Narcotics Unit \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00023227",
