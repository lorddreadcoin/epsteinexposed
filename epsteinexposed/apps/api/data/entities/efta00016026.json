As noted, a consent in the US would not be binding \non a court in the UK. (I can pull the relevant Extradition Act provisions cited below) While I suggested in our \ncall this is like the kind of colloquy necessary for a guilty plea, I am reminded that consent to extradited is \nirrevocable and not appealable —  no so with a plea. \nI  will try to write something up today, but my DOJ computer has been acting up. \nFrom: Anne-Marie Kundert \nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2020 10:22:36 AM (UTC+00:00) Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London \nTo: \nCc: Punam Chopra (Sensitive) \nSubject: RE: Extradition question \nDear all \nThe standard principle is that extradition should be sought only where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. If a RP \nindicated a willingness to fully abide by conditions of bail etc then it would be a matter for the US authorities as to \nwhether to accept those terms. If the RP returned to the UK but then reneged on the deal, then the failure to comply \nwith such undertakings would inevitably lead to a Request for extradition and would be a factor on whether the person \nis detained on bail or in custody. If the RP was to offer a consent, the Judge in court would need to satisfy himself that \nthe RP had received appropriate legal advice ( because it is irrevocable and there is no ground of appeal. The SSHD \nwould then have 2 months to arrange the surrender. The only consent that matters is the one before the extradition \njudge in the UK and it will usually be determined at the initial hearing but can be offered at any time before the \nextradition hearing has concluded. There is no caselaw on this to my mind but the relevant statutory provisions are s 72 \n(7)(b) and 72(8) for full order, s74 (7)(b) and s74 (8) for provisional arrest and s127 and s128 on consent- irrevocable \npoint/legal advice and sending of case to SSHD. \nHope this helps! \nAnne-marie \nAnne-Marie Kundert, Unit Head, Extradition \nInternational Justice and Organised Crime Division \nCrown Prosecution Service \nSBU -LAW ENFORCEMENT \nEFTA00016028\n\nFrom: \nSent: 09 Decem er 2011.11\nT \nCc: Punam Chopra (Sensitive) < \nSubject: RE: Extradition question \nDear \nThanks for your email. \nAnne-Marie Kundert \nI think the difficulty here is as you mention —  the consent given to the US authorities would not be binding on the RP in \nthe UK or on the UK court. Consent to extradition must be given irrevocably in writing to the UK court under s72 (8) \nExtradition Act 2003. In other words what the RP is offering in the US is a promise to consent before the UK court, which \nis unenforceable. \nI hope that assists —  I don't have a case to hand.

Any thoughts on this? \nMany thanks, \nFrom: \nI \nSent: Wednesday, Decem • \nTo: Anne-Marie Kundert \nCc: Punam Chopra (Sensitive) \nSubject: Extradition question \nDear Anne-Marie -  I  hope you are well. It has been too long since we have talked! \nI  have a UK extradition question which has been raised by a UK citz facing a US crime and currently \nbeing detained in the US. The defendant is seeking bail in the US and wants to execute a \nprophylactic \"consent to be extradited\" from the UK as proof that he is not a flight risk. \nEFTA00016029\n\nMy understanding of UK law is that even if \na defendant consents to be extradited, a UK judge still \nhas to independently be satisfied that the extradition comports with UK law. So, for instance, if the \ndefendant is released, flees to the UK, and then faces UK extradition, that consent may be evidence, \nbut a UK judge would still have to decide on all factors potentially applicable at the time of the \nextradition. (The defendant may also claim that his prophylactic consent was coerced by his \ncondition in the US.) Do I have that right? Is there a case or two which I can cite which stands for \nthat \nproposition? \nMany thanks! \nBest, \nU.S. Department ofJusticeAttaché \nUnited States Embassy -  London \nThis email has been scanned by the Symantec Email Security.cloud service. \nFor more information please visit http://www.symanteccloud.com \n*********************************************************************4. \nThis e-mail is private and \nis intended only for the addressee and any copy recipients. \nIts unauthorised use, disclosure, storage or copying is \nnot permitted. \nIf you are \nnot an intended recipient, please advise the sender immediately by reply e-\nmail and delete this message and any attachments without retaining a copy. \nActivity and use of departmental systems and the Criminal \nJustice Extranet is monitored \nto secure their effective operation and for other lawful business purposes. \nCommunications using these systems will also be monitored and may be recorded to secure \neffective operation and for other lawful business purposes. \n******** * * * * * * * * * * * * \n************************************************* \nCPS \nEFTA00016030",
