NATHAN, District Judge: \nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on \nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language \nallowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public \nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. \nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their \ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial \nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order. \nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), \"[a]t any time the court may, for \ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" \nThe good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether \ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of \nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's interest in the \ninformation.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party \nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good cause. Cl Gambale v. Deutsche \nBank \nAG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). \n1 \nEFTA00018562\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 2 of 3 \nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with \nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and \nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a \ngeneral matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the \nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of \ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should \n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or \ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery \nmaterials\"); see also United States v.  Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at \n*11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for \nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because \nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements \nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a \nfar different matter than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey \nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no \nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy \ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks \nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by \nlaw. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly \nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allows the \nDefense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant ... to Potential \nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the \ndefense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-1, ¶ 5. This proposal adequately balances the interests at \n2 \nEFTA00018563\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 3 of 3 \nstake. And as the Government's letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense \nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make \napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis. \nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use \ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The \nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal \nmatters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions \nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and \nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow. \nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with \nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of \ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to \nwhat materials were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's \npapers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a \nfair trial. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective \norder, \nwhich will be entered on the docket. \nThis resolves Dkt. No. 29. \nSO \nORDERED. \nDated: July 30, 2020 \nNew York, New York \n3 \nALISON J. NATHAN \nUnited States District Judge \nEFTA00018564",
