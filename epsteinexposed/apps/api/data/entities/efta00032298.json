Reyes' lawyer is only available to do a proffer this Friday, and given the ongoing investigation, it \nwill be difficult to make agents available for a takeout order. Would the USM make an exception and produce Reyes for a \nproffer on Friday? Thanks. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nTe \nEFTA00032298",
