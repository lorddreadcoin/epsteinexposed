Allison\" \nCc: r\">,\nSubject: RE: JPMorgan Chase Production \nDate: Fri, 08 Nov 2019 20:14:53 +0000 \n>, \"Sahni, Anjan\" \nTo update you on the wire collection, we anticipate making a production next week. We are trying to confirm now, but we \nbelieve that there are only five JPMC accounts —  two for Epstein and three for Maxwell —  for which there is wire data. \nSeparately, we also anticipate producing wire data for transactions related to Epstein, Maxwell, and where JPMC \nacted as a  correspondent bank. \nWe are also making progress on collecting other information, including account opening documents, KYC documents, and \naccount statements. Per our earlier conversations, we are compiling this information to make a single production rather \nthan providing it on a rolling basis. \nFinally, we also understand that JPM National Subpoena Processing heard from at the FBI. We called him just \nto say that to the extent he has questions, he can direct them to us. \nThanks, \nAllison \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, October 29, 2019 7:25 PM \nTo: Sahni, Anjan \nCc: \nSubject: RE: JPMorgan Chase Production \nc=> \nStoddart, Allison \nEXTERNAL. SENDER \nAnjan, \nThank you for checking in, and we look forward to receiving the update later this week. Regarding the subpoenas, I think \nthere was one subpoena served by the FBI just a day or two before we were first in touch, dated September 3, 2019, \nrelating to and then it appears we did inadvertently let the FBI serve one after we were in touch with \nyou, dated October 8, 2019, relating to .  If you've received any subpoenas addition to those (other than the \nones we've already previously discussed), please let us know, and otherwise we certainly will send any additional process \ndirectly to you—apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused by the separate service. \nThanks again, and talk soon. \nEFTA00030702\n\nFrom: Sahni, Anjan \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2019 23:21 \nTo: \nCc: \nIC\n; \nSubject: RE: JPMorgan Chase Production \n; Stoddart, Allison \n> \nHope all is well. We expect to have an update for you later this week on the timing of the wire production and our other \nongoing collection efforts. On a related note, we learned from JPMorgan's National Subpoena Processing that they \nreceived a couple subpoenas directly from the FBI, which I assume are related to the same investigation we've been \ndiscussing. For any additional subpoenas in this investigation directed to JPMorgan, could you please direct them to us? \nThat will help us get them to the appropriate team more quickly. \nThanks, \nAnjan \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, September 30, 2019 5:25 PM \nTo: Stoddart, Allison \nCc: Sahni, Anjan \nSubject: RE: JPMorgan Chase Production \nEXTERNAL SENDER \nAllison, \nReceived, thank you, and we were able to access the materials. \nthanks again, \nFrom: Stoddart, Allison \n< \nSent: Wednesday, September 25, 2019 20:12 \nTo: \nCc: Sahni, \nAnjan < \n>*, \n> \nSubject: [Not Virus Scanned] [Not Virus Scanned] JPMorgan Chase Production \nAttached is a letter on behalf of our client, JPMorgan Chase, along with an encrypted zip.
