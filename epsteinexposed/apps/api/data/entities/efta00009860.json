For now, we would like to look into having a vendor \nscan the entire file and make copies of any CDs and cassette tapes in the files. Would you be able to send us the names of \nvendors you have used in the past please? \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nI  St. Andrew's Plaza \n• 007 \nFrom \nSent: \nTo: USANYS \nCc: \n(USANYS) \n[Contractor] \nSubject: Re: SDFL Epstein-related documents \nSorry it took time to get back to you. In answer to the questions from the call. \n1. You are welcome to come to our office in West Palm Beach. We can set up a  floor where you will be reasonably alone \nand can safely scan materials. There is a Marriott within a block of our office if you decide to come. \n2. Turns out we cancelled our copy service earlier this year and never got it going again due to Covid. I can get names of \nvendors we used in the past if you want to go that route. \n3. There are cds and cassette tape in the materials according to the legal assistant that has done the inventory. \nFeel free to contact me with any other questions. \nBest regards \nEFTA00009860\n\nSent from my iPhone \nOn Aug 25, 2020, at 11:02 AM, \n(USANYS) < \n> wrote:\nThanks very much for the quick response 3pm today works for us.

Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow \nduring the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don't \nwork, let me know and we will work out an alternate time. \nIn the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the \ncase files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the 0PR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also \n0PR has their own inventory of the materials. \nWhen 0PR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the \ndocuments that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own D0J accounts. I was overseas at the \ntime on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well. \nA copy of our inventory is attached. \nI look forward to assisting you in this matter. \nBest regards, \nManaging Assistant United States Attorney \nWest Palm Beach Regional Office —  SDFL \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSe \nTo: \nEFTA00009861\n\nCc: \n•*>: \n(USANYS) \n(USANYS) [Contractor] \nSubject: SDFL Epstein-related documents \nWe supervise the team in New York that is currently prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell, and \nsuggested we reach out to you.

Please let us know if you have time for a call in the near future to discuss further. \nAlternatively, if there is a more appropriate point of contact on this issue, please feel free to point us in that direction. \nThanks \nvery \nmuch \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00009862",
