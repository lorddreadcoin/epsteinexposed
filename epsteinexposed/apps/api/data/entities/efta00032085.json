I said my assumption was that we had no position or view at all with respect to \nEFTA00032085\n\nwhat victims' counsel should or should not do, and wouldn't direct victim counsel on something like that, but that I \nwould let him know if that was incorrect. So please let me know if we should convey something else, and I'm happy to \npass it along, otherwise I've conveyed our neutrality. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00032086",
