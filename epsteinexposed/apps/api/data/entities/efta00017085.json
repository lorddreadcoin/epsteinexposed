Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nAugust 5, 2020 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 \n(MN) \nDear Counsel: \nThis letter provides discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure (\"Fed. R. Crim. P.\"), and seeks reciprocal discovery.' \nDisclosure by the Government \nBased on your request for discovery in this case, enclosed please find copies of the \nmaterials listed in the attached index, which materials are stamped with control numbers \nSDNY GM 00000001 through SDNY_GM_00012841. If you wish to inspect any of the physical \nevidence referenced in these materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us \nknow, and we will make arrangements for you to do so. \nThe Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), \nand its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This \ndisclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information \nconstitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. \nSpecifically, the Government discloses the following: \n• \nThe Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 \n(1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule set by \nthe Court. \nIn addition to information provided herein, please note that this Office periodically posts content \non social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Members of the public may \npost comments in response to the Office's postings. We do not control these user-generated \ncomments, nor do we monitor or regularly review such comments. You may directly access these \nsocial media platforms in the event you believe someone may have posted information relevant to \nthis case. \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00017085\n\nPage 2 \nDisclosure by the Defendant \nIn light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests \nreciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow \ninspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the \ndefendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as \nevidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental \nexaminations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies \nthereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to \nintroduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the \ndefendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of \nwitnesses he \nwill call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We \nrequest that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the \ndefendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. \nSentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility \nThis Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines \navailable for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations \npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks \nprior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions \nremain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court \nsix weeks in advance of the trial. \nFinally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, \nno plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives \nof the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not \nreduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not \nconstitute a \"formal offer\" or a \"plea offer,\" as those terms are used in Lefler v.  Cooper, 132 S.Ct. \n1376 (2012); Missouri v. Flye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012). \nBates Start Bates End \nConfidential Non-PDF \nFiles \nSummary Description \nConfidential \nDocuments \nSDNY_GM_00000001 SDNY_GM_00000002 \nGhislaine Maxwell Joint Automated \nBooking System Summary \nSDNY GM 00000003 SDNY GM 00000044 \nPen Register Orders and \nApplications \nSDNY_GM_00000045 SDNY_GM_00000717 Search Warrants and Applications Confidential \nSDNY_GM 00000718 SDNY GM 00000833 \nImmigration and Travel Records for \nJeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine \nMaxwell \nSDNY_GM_00000834 SDNY_GM_00000905 \nUnsealing materials pertaining to 15 \nCiv 7433 (RWS), 19 Misc 149 (CM) \n06.20.2018 \nEFTA00017086\n\nslozorco \n1 돠！8W크J아lsanbau \nDDI／寸 913'S어刃0 I4E) 人NOS 1 SIPS어）001 IM91人NOS \nIB11u히기！\nu0그 \n1 돠)JODa)J ua니D이iawp VLt'SOOOO I시9 人NOS \n1 \nZ8LPO어）OV'J9人NOS \nH,,,. 刃； ,，』.羽』 IIweiS弑 \n\"  \"  \" 凹 \"  \"  \"   \" \" \" \n1\n9LLV0000'\nVI9ANaS \naMxe1M \naute1司니9 \n1 101 \nU이18山兀刈！ \nspioaai a函Do9 \n19LP0000INV\n' \nANGS \no1 \nSurteiai spioJai \niapaJ \n4580) \nP戶D \n\"  \"  \" 凹 \"  \"  \"   \" \" \"  1ZUP0 叩0\n\"    INS \nANGS \n떠luapijuoj \n1pue \n1BS9P0000 \nINS \nANGS \n口瑥誥蒜裁烈 \nI@\nMXBVI \naulel돠니S \n04   2uiieiai SPJ03a)J   e!padx크 \nLS9P0 凹0 \nINS ANGS 1LS9P0 \n凹0\n\" \nINS \nANGS \nI8!\n1UaP小刃D \n1 \n959P0 \n凹0' \nINS ANGS !\n1\n959P0 \n凹0' \nINS \nANGS \nI8!\n4UaP小刃D \n1OS9P0000 \nINS ANGS \n1 ,．只 \naU!\nBS!
