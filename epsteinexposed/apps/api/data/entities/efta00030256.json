It is similar to \nwhat \nsays she \nwas \ntold when she witnessed young girls coming to the NY mansion —  that they were there for \n\"modeling interviews\" with Victoria Secret. It is redacted so you \ncan't tell who recruited her but \nit appears to be a \nfemale. \nGood luck \nwith everything, \nSigrid \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \n401 E.
