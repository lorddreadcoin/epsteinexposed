If that's right, \ncould you please let us know who that person will be? So far we've just gotten the request from one plaintiff's counsel, \nRobbie Kaplan at Kaplan Hecker, and her request is very narrow but we want to set up the system in a way that will work if \nwe get additional and/or more expansive requests going forward. And we would like to let her know how she should \nproceed relatively soon because that case has a status conference on January 10 and I think they'd like to make the \nrequest before then. \nPlease let us know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks as always. \n= \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00031088",
