M is willing to provide us with a copy of the \nagreement, but he indicated that he believes he needs a subpoena before he can do so. His firm has already provided \nus with copies of all other court filings and deposition transcripts from the civil case voluntarily. The settlement \nagreement resolving the case is relevant to our ongoing investigation into Maxwell's participation in the abuse of \nand other underage girls. \nThanks, \nMaurene \n<2021.03.26, \nsubpoena to IM> \nEFTA00027727",
