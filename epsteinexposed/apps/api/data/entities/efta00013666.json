Tein, Esq. \nLewis Tein, P.L. \n3059 \nGrand Avenue. \nSuite 340 \nCoconut \nGrove, FL 33133 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Mr. \nTein: \n500 South Australian Ave.. Suite 400 \nWest Palm Beach. FL 33401 \n(5611820-8711 \nFacsimile: (5611 820-8777 \nJuly \n17, 2008 \nThe \nOffice \nhas reviewed \nyour \n\"Notice of Continued Pendency \nof \nFederal \nCriminal \nAction,\" \nand we feel that it misrepresents the posture of the federal investigation. For \nexample, you cite to In re Grand Jury, No. FGJ 07-103 (WPB), as evidence that the federal \ncriminal action remains pending. That is a  citation to Mr. Epstein's Motion to Quash a \nsubpoena for computer equipment removed from Mr. Epstein's home after he and his \nattorneys were aware of the existence of the state investigation. Pursuant to the Non-\nProsecution Agreement, that motion was supposed to have been withdrawn several months \nago, and, \ntherefore, is not \"pending\" in \nour estimation. \nThe Non-Prosecution Agreement calls for deferment of federal prosecution \"in favor \nof prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the [enumerated] \nconditions and the requirements of th[e] Agreement . . .\" (Non-Prosecution Agreement, p. \n2 (emphasis \nadded).) One of those conditions is Epstein's agreement that the subject Jane \nDoes, \nwhile \nminors, were victims of a \nviolation of an \noffense \nenumerated in Title 18, United \nStates Code \nSection 2255, and \nthat \nthey \"will have the \nsame rights to \nproceed under \nSection \n2255 as [they] \nwould have had if Mr. Epstein had been tried and convicted \nof an enumerated \noffense.\" (United States Attorney's December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez.) \nIf, in fact, your position is that the \nfederal criminal action is still pending such that the \nCourt \nmust stay \nthe \ncivil \nproceedings. then \nthe Office proposes that \nwe seek the \nprompt \nresolution of the Motion to Quash, so that the computer equipment can be analyzed and the \nEFTA00013666\n\nMICHAEL TEIN, ESQ. \nJULY 17,2008 \nPAGE 2 \nfederal investigation can \ncontinue. If, instead. Mr. Epstein intends to fully abide by the Non-\nProsecution Agreement, then the \"federal Grand Jury investigation will remain suspended, \nand all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until \n[Epstein] violates any term of [the Non-Prosecution Agreement].\" (Non\n-Prosecution \nAgreement, page 5.) \nPlease advise \nwhether you intend to correct the representations to the \nCourt regarding \nthe status of the federal \ninvestigation. \nSincerely, \nBy: \ncc: Jack \nGoldber er, Esq. \n, \nEsq. \nR.
