Such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall be of \nthe same make and model \nnumber as \nthe Engine or APU suffering the Event of Loss and shall be free and clear of all Liens and shall \nhave a value, utility and useful life at least equal to, and be in as good \nan operating condition as, the Engine \nor APU suffering the Event of Loss, assuming such \nEngine or APU was in the condition and repair required \nby the terms \nhereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of \nLoss. Borrower, at its own cost \nand expense, \nshall fumish Agent with such documents to evidence such \nconveyance and make such filings \nas \nAgent shall request to subject such engine or auxiliary power unit, as \napplicable, to the lien of this \nAgreement. Each such \nreplacement engine or auxiliary power unit, as \napplicable, shall, after such \nconveyance be deemed an \"Engine\" or \"APU\" (as defined \nherein), as applicable, and shall be deemed part \nof the same Aircraft as was the \nEngine or APU \nreplaced \nthereby. \n(c) Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all \nproceeds payable by any insurer with \nrespect to an Event of Loss, by any manufacturer with respect to a  Retum \nto Manufacturer or by any \ngovernmental authority with \nrespect to any Requisition of Use, as the case may \nbe; provided, however, that \nso long as no \nDefault or Event of Default then exists and Borrower has \ncomplied with the provisions of this \nSection 2.7, \nthen Agent shall remit such proceeds to Borrower. \n(d) If the Airframe, any Engine, APU \nor \nmajor Part has \nsuffered any damage \nrequiring the FM \nto be notified of such damage by \nuse of an FAA Form 337 or otherwise, then within ten \n(10) days \nof such \nnotification to the FM, Borrower \nshall notify Agent of such damage, and Agent \nand. Borrower shall consult \nfor the purpose of determining the diminished value of the Aircraft \nresulting from such damage history. The \ndiminished \nvalue of the Aircraft shall be the amount by which the fair \nmarket sales value of the Aircraft \nwithout such damage history \nexceeds the fair market sales value of the \nAircraft with such damage history. \nFor purposes hereof, fair market sales value \nshall be determined on the following basis: (i) the value shall \nbe the \namount which would be obtained in an arm's length \ntransaction between an informed and willing \nbuyer (who is not a used aircraft \ndealer), and an informed and willing seller under no \ncompulsion to sell; (ii) \nthe \ncosts of removal \nof the Aircraft from \nits \nthen location shall not be \na \ndeduction from such value; and (iii) in \ndetermining any \nsuch value, it shall be assumed (whether or not the same be \ntrue) that the Aircraft has been \nmaintained by \nBorrower and is in the condition \nin which it  is required to be \nin accordance with this \nAgreement and that the total number of Airframe flight hours \n(including any component with hourly overhaul \nschedules) accumulated \nfrom \nthe Closing Date to \nthe date of such \ndamage do not exceed the product of the \nflight hours limitation set forth in \nAnnex B hereto times the number of twelve month \nperiods and any portion \nthereof from the \nClosing Date to such date. \nWithin ten (10) days after Borrower and Agent agree upon the \ndiminished value of the Aircraft, \nBorrower shall pay \nAgent the amount of such diminished value, which payment \nAgent shall apply as a \npartial \nprepayment of the Obligations without any \nprepayment penalty. If Borrower and Agent cannot \nagree \non the \ndiminished value of the Aircraft within ten (10) days after \nnotification of such damage to the FM, \nthen Agent shall appoint an independent appraiser \n(reasonably \nacceptable to Borrower) to determine \nsuch \nvalue. Borrower agrees to pay the costs and \nexpenses of \nany \nsuch determination \nand appraisal. The \nindependent appraiser shall be required to complete such \ndetermination as promptly as practicable, but in \nany event, not later \nthan forty (40) days after the date on which it is appointed. A \nfinal determination by the \nindependent \nappraiser regarding the extent of any diminished value of the \nAircraft shall be binding on \nBorrower and \nAgent. \nWithin ten (10) days after the \nindependent appraiser's determination of \nthe \ndiminished \nvalue of the Aircraft, Borrower \nshall pay Agent the amount of such diminished \nvalue, which payment \nLenders shall apply as a \npartial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty. \n2394767 \n9 \n(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT) \nEFTA00012253\n\nI \nEFTA00012254\n\nSECTION 3.

Without limiting \nthe \ngenerality \nof the foregoing, Borrower \nagrees that upon the occurrence \nof an Event of \nDefault, Agent, \nwithout \ndemand or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or \nprivate sale) to or upon Borrower or any other Person (all and each of which \ndemands and/or notices are \nhereby expressly waived), in \nAgent's sole discretion, may exercise \nany one \nor more of the following \nremedies: (i) proceed at law or in equity, to \nenforce specifically Borrower's performance or to recover \ndamages; (ii) terminate the right of any third party to use, possess or control the Aircraft; (iii) to the extent \npermitted by Applicable Law, enter the premises where the \nAircraft is located and take immediate \npossession of and \nremove (or disable in place) the Aircraft (and/or any Engines, APU and/or Parts then \nunattached to the Aircraft) by self-help, \nsummary proceedings or otherwise without liability if conducted in \naccordance with Applicable \nLaw; (iv) use Borrower's premises for storage without liability, \nexcept for its \nown gross negligence or willful \nmisconduct; (v) preserve the Airframe, Engines, APU and/or Parts, and \ntheir respective \nvalue \n(but without any \nobligation to do so), immobilize \nor \nkeep idle the Airframe and/or \nany \nEngine, APU \nor Part, manage, sell, \nlease, assign or otherwise dispose of the Airframe and/or any \n2394767 \n12 (RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT) \nEFTA00012259\n\nEFTA00012260\n\nEngine, APU or Part or any of the other Collateral, whether or \nnot in Agent's possession, in one or more \nparcels, at public or private sale or sales, with no less than ten (10) working days' prior notice to Borrower \nof any proposed sale or lease of \nthe Airframe or any Engine, which Borrower acknowledges as \nconstituting \n\"reasonable prior notice\" for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention, at such prices as \nAgent may deem best; (vi) apply any deposit, other cash collateral, or collect and apply \nproceeds to \nreduce any amounts due to Agent and/or Lenders; (vii) terminate any Third Party Agreement, \nwithout \nregard as to the existence of any event of default thereunder and recover, or cause Borrower and any \nparty to any Third Party \nAgreement and any \nPerson taking by or through any of \nthem to relinquish \npossession and return the Aircraft, including the Engines, APU \nand Parts, pursuant to this Section 5, \nand/or exercise any \nand all other remedies under any Third Party Agreements, or in Borrower's stead, to \nthe extent provided for under, or otherwise available to \nBorrower in connection with any Third Party \nAgreement; (viii) collect, receive, appropriate and \nrealize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof; (ix) \ndemand and obtain from any court speedy relief pending final determination available at law (including, \nwithout limitation, \npossession, \ncontrol, custody or immobilization of \nthe Aircraft or \npreservation of the \nAircraft or its fair market value); (x) procure the deregistration (whether by utilizing the IDERA or \notherwise) and/or export and \nphysical \ntransfer of the Aircraft from the territory in \nwhich it is then \nsituated; \nand (xi) exercise any and all other \nremedies allowed by \nApplicable Law, including, \nwithout \nlimitation, the \nCape \nTown Convention and the UCC.

Borrower further agrees, at \nAgent's request, \nto assemble the \nCollateral, make it available to Agent at such places as \nAgent shall reasonably select, \nwhether at \nBorrower's \npremises or elsewhere. Agent shall deliver to each Lender its \npro \nrata share \nof the \nnet proceeds of any such realization (after deducting \nall reasonable costs and expenses of every kind \nincurred in \nconnection therewith) (\"Net \nProceeds\")  based on \nsuch Lender's pro \nrata share of the \nObligations then outstanding first, to \nbe applied to the \npayment in whole \nor in part of the Obligations in such \norder and manner as Lenders may elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be \ndisbursed to \nBorrower. To \nthe extent \npermitted by \napplicable law, Borrower waives \nall claims, damages \nand demands against Agent and each Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or other \ndisposition of the Collateral, except any claims or damages related \nto or arising out of the gross \nnegligence or willful \nmisconduct of Agent or such Lender and any claims to any excess Net Proceeds \nremaining after the application of any Net Proceeds in accordance with the \nimmediately preceding \nsentence. \nBorrower \nagrees that Agent need not give more than \nten (10) \nworking \ndays' notice (as \ncontemplated under the Cape \nTown Convention) of the time \nand place of any \npublic \nsale or of the time \nafter \nwhich a \nprivate sale may take \nplace and that such notice is reasonable notification of such matters. \nBorrower shall be liable for \nany \ndeficiency if the proceeds of \nany sale or disposition \nof the Collateral are \ninsufficient to pay \nin full the \nObligations. \n5.2 Relief Pending Final Determination. \nWithout limiting the generality of Agent's other \nremedies set forth in this Section 5, in the event Agent \nadduces evidence of an Event of Default by \nBorrower, Agent may, pending final determination of its claim, obtain from a court speedy (as defined in \nArticle 20 \nof the Cape Town Convention) \nrelief in the \nform of such one or \nmore \nof the \nfollowing orders as \nAgent requests: \n(a) preservation of the Aircraft \nand its value; \n(b) possession, control or custody of the Aircraft; \n(c) \nimmobilization of the Aircraft; \n(d) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the \nAircraft and \nthe income therefrom; and \n(e) if  at any time Borrower and Agent specifically agree, \nsale and application of \nproceeds \ntherefrom. \nIn furtherance thereof, Agent and Borrower hereby agree to exclude the \napplication of paragraph , \n4  of Article 20 \nof the Cape Town Convention. Nothing in this Section 5.2 \nshall \nlimit the availability to \nAgent of other forms of interim relief. \n2394767 \n13 \n(RK•244 \nSECURITY AGREEMENT) \nEFTA00012261\n\nEFTA00012262\n\n5.3 No Waiver: Cumulative Remedies.

No express or implied \nwaiver by Agent and/or Lenders of any Default or \nEvent of Default hereunder shall in any way be, or be construed \nto be, a  waiver of any future or \nsubsequent Default or Event of \nDefault. The failure or delay of Agent and/or Lenders in exercising any \nrights granted it \nhereunder \nupon the occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not \nconstitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or \nreoccurrence of any such contingencies or \nsimilar \ncontingencies, and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by Agent and/or \nLenders \nshall not \nexhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided for or otherwise \nreferred to \nherein. After the \noccurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the acceptance by Agent \nand/or Lenders \nof any \ninstallment of \nprincipal \nand/or interest or of \nany other sum \nowing hereunder or under the \nother \nLoan Documents shall not constitute a waiver of such Default \n(unless such Default arose from the failure \nto pay such installment and such installment was paid in full) or \nEvent of Default, regardless of Agent's \nand/or either Lender's knowledge or lack of knowledge \nthereof at the time of acceptance of any such \npayment and shall not constitute a reinstatement of this \nAgreement if Agent and/or either Lender has sent \nBorrower a  notice of default, unless Agent shall have agreed in \nwriting to reinstate this Agreement and \nwaive the Default or Event \nof Default. To the extent permitted by \nApplicable Law, Borrower \nwaives any \nrights now or \nhereafter \nconferred by statute or \notherwise that limit \nor modify any rights or remedies of \nAgent and/or Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, \nthe provisions of Articles 11(2) \nand 13(2) of the Convention and Article IX(6) of the Protocol. \nSECTION \n6. \nMiscellaneous.\n6.1 Notices.
