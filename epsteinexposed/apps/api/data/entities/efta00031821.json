We do not need this to be a signed declaration, but it would helpful if you \ncould please provide statement in a separate pdf with whatever attribution she is comfortable with. We will plan \nto publicly file that pdf as an exhibit to our memorandum of law in opposition to the bail motion. \nFeel free to call my cell if you'd like to discuss or have any questions. \nBest, \nFrom: Sigrid McCawley \nSent: Monday, December 14, 2020 8:39 PM \nTo: \nCc: Sigrid McCawley \nSubject: \nFiling \nHello \nI hope you are doing great. This is the statement that \nit in? Should it be as a signed declaration? She is comfortable having it attributed to her name. \n\"I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more request that \nGhislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of myself, but all of the other \ngirls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and \nthe government has the responsibility to make sure that she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will \nhappen or that any of her victims will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, \nabusing her position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would \nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior. \nwould like to submit. What format would you like me to send \nEFTA00031821\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has lived since that time, \nI believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children and young women is evidence of \nher disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has demonstrated a complete failure to accept to \nresponsibility in any way for her actions and demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in \nprocuring victims for Epstein. She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, \nconsistent with what many of her victims have described. She has frequently lied to others, including \nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle relying on Epstein \nand others to fund her lavish existence. \nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and that she is willing to \nharm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She will not hesitate to leave the \ncountry irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially for her actions because she lacks \nempathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. She would in fact be highly motivated to flee \nin order to reduce the possibility of continued imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously \ncomplained. Her actions over the last several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that \nbeing comfortable is more important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she \nhas the ability to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a \nlifetime. I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her \nincarcerated until her trial.\" \nSigrid McCawley \nPartner \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER \nwww.bsfllp.com\nThe information contained in this electronic message is confidential information Intended only for the use of the named reciplent(s) and may contain information that, among \nother protections, is the subject of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.
