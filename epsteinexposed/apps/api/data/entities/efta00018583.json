Paglluca \nP11 \nIIIIIIIMPPOIMIIIMPIIIMPIO \nwww.hmflaw.com \nAugust 9, \n2020 \nVIA EMAIL \nAssistant United States Attorney \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: Conferral Concerning Use of Discovery Materials GM_00000847-962 \nDear \nMs. Maxwell is actively litigating issues related to disclosure of confidential material \nin ME v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) and a related appeal in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 20-2413. \nWe intend to ask Judge Nathan for permission to refer to and attach, as exhibits, the \nabove referenced discovery materials which relate to the Government's efforts to \nobtain civil litigation discovery material (\"the Unsealing Materials\") in two, settled, \ncivil matters in which Ms. Maxwell was named a defendant. These materials would \nbe disclosed to Judge Preska and designated as part of the appendix to Ms. Maxwell's \nappeal in the Second Circuit. We have no objection, at this point, to filing the \nmaterials under seal in both courts. \nIn your letter to defense counsel dated August 5, 2020 you designated the Unsealing \nMaterials as Confidential. We understand that the Unsealing Materials were filed ex \nparte and remain sealed in the miscellaneous actions. The documents, however, do \nnot contain confidential information as that term is defined in paragraph 8 of the \nProtective Order entered by Judge Nathan. The Unsealing Materials are ex parte \npleadings filed by the Government, transcripts of ex parte hearings regarding those \npleadings, and ex parte rulings on the pleadings. As least one set of individuals \noutside this prosecution, the Boies, Schiller & Flexner lawyers cooperating with the \nGovernment, are aware of the Unsealing Materials. Moreover, these are the types of \npleadings that the Second Circuit has characterized as judicial documents with a \npresumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. \n2019). Ms. Maxwell, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order in this case, notifies \nEFTA00018583\n\nAugust 9, 2020 \nPage 2 \nthe Government that she objects to the confidential designation and requests that the \nGovernment withdraw the designation. \nThe relevance of these documents to the unsealing protocol currently in process \nbefore Judge Preska and the related appeal are readily apparent and I believe that the \ngovernment should, in the interest of justice, agree to these requests. If that is not the \ncase, I  am happy to confer further about the issue as soon as possible. The Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals established an expedited briefing schedule and Judge Preska \nordered that the parties in 15 Civ. 7433 meet regarding modification to the unsealing \nprotocol by August 10, 2020. Accordingly, we will need to raise this issue with Judge \nNathan this week. \nPlease let me know your position on the matter and, if you would like to discuss the \nrequest further, your availability on August 10 or 11, 2020. \nVery truly yours, \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nEFTA00018584",
