NATHAN, District Judge: \nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule \n17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell's \nmoving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and \nFlexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the \nGovernment submitted a letter requesting that it be given notice of all pending and future \nsubpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents \nproduced. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's motion as to Requests 1 \nthrough 8 and Request 12 and reserves judgment on Requests 9 through 11. The Court also \ndenies the Government's requests, though it will direct the Government to notify the Court of its \nviews as to Requests 9 through 11. \nI. Legal Standard \nRule 17(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of \"books, papers, documents, \ndata, or other objects.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of \npersonal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by \ncourt order. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). \n1 \nEFTA00020298\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 2 of 9 \nThe purpose of Rule 17(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to \ntrial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, \n418 U.S. 683, 698-99 \n(1974) (citing Bowman Dairy Co. v.  United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951)). It is not intended \nto provide an additional means of discovery or to serve as a general \"fishing expedition.\" Id. at \n698-700. As a result, courts must be mindful not to allow the Rule 17(c) process to become a \n\"broad discovery device\" that would undermine the discovery procedures set forth in Rule 16. \nUnited \nStates v.  Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Thus, if an item is not \ndiscoverable under Rule 16, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under \nRule 17. United States v.  Barnes, No. S9 04-CR-186 (SCR), 2008 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. \nApr. 2, \n2008). \nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the \nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700. In Nixon, the Supreme Court \nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must show: (1) that \nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably \nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for \ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such \ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good \nfaith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition.\"' Id. at 698-700. To clear that hurdle, \nthe Court considers (1) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. Id. at 700. \nII. Discussion \nA. The BSF Subpoena \nThe proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents \nthat Maxwell believes will be relevant at trial. For others, the proffered relevance relates to \n2 \nEFTA00020299\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 3 of 9 \nMaxwell's pending motions to suppress evidence. While ordinarily Rule 17(c) is \"trial-focused\" \nand \"may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial,\" at least some courts \nhave held that Rule 17(c) can be used to compel the production of documents in connection with \na suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. 04-CR-203 (LTS), 2005 WL 180885, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2005). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated below. \nRequests 1  through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon's specificity \nrequirement. Requests 1  through 5 all target communications between \"any\" owner, \nshareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil \nlitigation, from 2015 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject, \nthe requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule 17(c) subpoena would be improper. As \nset forth in the subpoena, the term \"communications\" encompasses \"all forms of correspondence, \nincluding regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other written communication of \ninformation of any kind.\" The use of the terms \"all\" and \"any\" \"do not evince specificity.\" \nUnited States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19-CR-472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, \n2021). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose \ncommunications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. \n2017) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new \nrequested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it identified a specified set of \nindividuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass \"all\" forms of \ncorrespondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period \nbetween 2015 and 2021, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the \nkind of \"fishing expedition\" that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bowman \nDairy Co., 341 U.S. at 221. Indeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. \n3 \nEFTA00020300\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 4 of 9 \nSee United States v. Avenatti, No. (SI) I9-CR-373 (PGG), 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. \nJan. 6, 2020). But Rule 17(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 698; \nWey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253. On the specificity prong alone, Requests 1  through 5 fail to satisfy \nthe Nixon standard. \nRequests 1 and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials \nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests 1, 2, and 8 all seek documents \nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests 1 and 2 seek \ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2015 \nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that \nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule 17(c) \nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government's failure to comply with its \ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be \notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 418 \nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the \nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government \nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule 17(c) subpoena process is not the proper \nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly \njoined, Maxwell must make some showing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief \nfrom this Court. \nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement letters between BSF \nand two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required showing \nunder Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule 17(c) \napplication. The only plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell's papers is that these \n4 \nEFTA00020301\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 5 of 9 \ndocuments are necessary for purposes of impeachment. But as a general matter, the need to \nimpeach witnesses generally \"is insufficient to require [materials'] production in advance of \ntrial.\" Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701. Many courts have held that impeachment material does not \nbecome relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No. 15-CR-317 \n(ICMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), ), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. \n2021) (collecting cases); United States v. Scaduto, No. 94-CR-311 (WK), 1995 WL 130511, at \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 1995) (\"Potentially impeaching statements `ripen into evidentiary \nmaterial. . . only if and when the witness testifies at trial....\" (citation omitted)). See also \nAvenatti, 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings \nin question prior to trial in order \"to demonstrate witnesses' bias or self-interest.\"). The \narguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance \nthe materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is little risk that \nreview of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, \ngiven their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. I6-CR-467, 2017 WL 4838311, at *2 \n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2017). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF \nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require \nproduction of the engagement letters to the Court so that the information can be made available \nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See United \nStates v.  Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at \n*3 \n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992); \nUnited States v.  Ferguson, No. 3:06-CR-137 (CFD), 2007 WL 4577303, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. \n26, 2007). \nMaxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials' production under Rule 17(c) is \njustified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand \n5 \nEFTA00020302\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 6 of 9 \njury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that \nproduction suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through \nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain how the contents of those letters may be relevant to \nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the \nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce \nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is little more than an attempt to \ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not \nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents \nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion & \nOrder resolving some of Maxwell's pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good \nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to \ncomply with them. This Court knows well that the Government has not always lived up to those \nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good \nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum, \nnone of Maxwell's theories justify production of these documents under the Rule 17(c) process. \nRequest 12, which seeks \"any\" submission to the Epstein Victims' Compensation \nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks \n\"any\" submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell \noffered to narrow this request to just those materials submitted on behalf of victims who \nultimately testify in this action. \nThe request's failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of \nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this \nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submitted to the EVCP. \n6 \nEFTA00020303\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 7 of 9 \nSee United States v. Aguilar, No. CR 07-00030 (SBA), 2008 WL 3182029, at *6 (ND. Cal. Aug. \n4, 2008). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary \nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are \nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be \nimpeachment evidence does not render them \"relevant\" for purposes of Rule 17(c); if at all, those \ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2018 WL 2254538, \nat *2. Maxwell's argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is \nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or \nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are \nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for \npurposes of cross-examination, leaving little doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And \nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be \nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why \nthat expectation might be reasonable. The \"mere hope\" that the documents may contain some \nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule 17(c) subpoena (or, as here, \nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984). Maxwell's reliance on cases \ninvolving the Government's obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment \nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request \n12's \ncompliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell \nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose \nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At \nthat time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to \n7 \nEFTA00020304\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 8 of 9 \nthe Court so that the information may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the \nconclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See Giampa, 1992 WL 296440, at *3; Ferguson, \n2007 WL 4577303, at *3. \nThe Court will reserve on Requests 9 through II in order to allow the Government to \nweigh in on the propriety of the requests. The Court assumes that the Government has enough \ninformation, based on the public filings, to provide its views. If the Government seeks the \nspecific subpoena requests, it shall confer with defense counsel and raise any dispute with the \nCourt. The Government shall file its response within one week of this Order. \nIn sum, for Request 1  through 8 and 12, the Court will not authorize service of the \nproposed subpoena on the basis that Maxwell has failed to establish that the requests are \nsufficiently specific and that the materials sought are relevant or admissible. Maxwell may \nrenew more tailored requests in compliance with this Order. The Court sees no basis for doing \nso on an ex parte basis. For Requests 9 through 11, the Court will reserve its decision until it \nhears from the Government. \nB. The Government's Subpoena-Related Request \nThe Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future \nsubpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and production of any information obtained \ntherefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena \nfor which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the \nCourt would likely consider the Government's briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty \nto ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon. See United States v. Bergstein, No. \nI6-CR-746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017). But ex parte Rule 17(c) \nsubpoenas are possible in some circumstances if justified. See Sicelos, 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 \n8 \nEFTA00020305\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 9 of 9 \n(collecting cases). As a result, the blanket ruling sought by the Government is improper and \ndenied. \nIII. Conclusion \nThe Defendant's motion for an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) \nis DENIED. The Government is ORDERED to respond to Requests 9 through 11 of the \nproposed subpoena within one week of this Order. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: April 27, 2021 \nNew York, New York ALISON J.
