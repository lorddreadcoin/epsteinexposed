Refer to Chapter 10 \nand make \nsure \nyou're aware of the moves that you \nshouldn't \nmake, the places that you \nshouldn't \npress, and the conditions you shouldn't \ntreat. \nye Think 3-D: Refer to Chapter 4 and try to \nvisualize \nthe invisible physical \nstructures beneath the \nskin that you're affecting \nwith your hands during \nthe \nmassage \nso \nUse your \nwhole body. Remember to use \ncorrect \nbody \nmechanics in order to save your own \nbody \nfrom overexertion while applying \njust the right \namount of \npressure for your partner. \nto• Focus on the \nother. This is no \ntime to be thinking \nabout politics, sports, the \nweather, or your \nupcoming turn to receive. As fully as you can, \nfocus on \nyour partner, what she's feeling, \nand \nhow you can make her feel \nbetter. \nso \nGo out of your mind: After you figure out \nthe \nmoves, practice the \ntechnique, \nand focus \non \nyour \npartner with all \nyour \nconcentration, then \nyou can stop thinking. Let go of your extraneous \nthoughts — and even your thoughts about doing \na good \njob. \nso \nGet \ncreative: Go \nahead, \ngo \ncrazy: just let \nyourself feel whatever you're feeling \nand go \nwith your \nintuition. \nAs long as what you're doing \nis generated \nfrom caring and \ncommitment to \nyour partner, it is going \nto be the right thing. \nso \nLet love flow \nCertain people \ndevelop an ability \nto send a  very \ndistinct and palpable \nsensation of \nlove into \ntheir fingers and palms. You can \nfeel it \nwhen they touch you. Everyone \nelse has the \npotential to develop that ability. Why \nnot use \nmassage as an opportunity to explore your own \ninnate \nabilities to send a powerful \nmessage of \ncaring to others through your touch \nand \npresence? \nOse \nMassage-English, \nEnglish-Massage \nDictionary \nTerm \nDefinition \nRolled Deep massage \nwork on fascia that \nrealigns the \nbody with gravity \nBody A practitioner of \nmassage or \nworker similar hands-on healing techniques \nStructural Massage that realigns the body's \nwork structure \nSpa Health facility where people go \nto learn \nholistic practices, eat \nhealthy foods, exercise, and receive \nmassages and spa \ntreatments \nAyurveda An ancient healing \nsystem from \nIndia \nthat \nuses \ndiet, meditation, \nherbs. and massage to balance the body \nSwedish \nThe most \nwell-known and widely \npracticed form of massage \nin the \nWestern world, Consisting of \nstroking, \nkneading, applying pressure, stretching, \nand so on \nTrigger \nA tight, \ntender spot in muscles \npoint that responds \nwell \nto \ntargeted \nmassage \nConnective The web of tissue \n(primarily collagen\ntissues fibers) \nthat surround \nyour every \nmuscle. \norgan, and \nbone, \nholding \nyour body \ntogether \nDeep A type of massage \nthat targets the deeper \ntissue layers of muscle and \nconnective tissue \nEnergy Type of \nmassage that \nfocuses on \nvital. \nwork \ninvisible energies in \nyour body \nAdhesion Muscle and \nconnective \ntissue \nfibers \nthat \nare stuck together, which massage \ncan \nseparate \nDrape \nTowels, \nsheets, and so \non, used \nto cover a \nperson \nreceiving a \nmassage \nKnots Tight bands \nof muscle \nfibers \nand \nconnective tissues that \nmassage \noften \nSoftens \nOn-site Seated and clothed massage given \nmassage \nin \nspecial chairs — \nusually \nin offices, in \nstores, \nor at \nspecial events \nParlor \nPlace \nwhere people \neat \nice \ncream \nFull \nbody \nmassage \nRelaxation \nmassage \ntreating the \nwhole \nbody as compared to \nremedial \nmassage \ntreating a \nlocalized area \n...For \nDummies : \nBestselling \nBook \nSeries \nfor \nBeginners \nEFTA00008021\n\nMassage For \nDummies' \no 0 V \nN., \n'wv\nA \n• 'es \nV V \" \" e •   V \nNJ \nDanger \nZones \nThese areas \ncontain \nimportant pieces \nof \nyour anatomy in exposed and vulnerable \npositions. Highly \ntrained \nto stay\ned\ntherapists can actually work in these areas, but if you're not a  massage professional yourself, \nit's boner\naway from the \nfollowing spots: \nvs \nFront of the neck/throat: You've heard of the \nexpression, \n\"Go for the \njugular,\" right? Well, this is where you \nfind it. Unless you're \ntrying to choke \nsomeone, it's a good idea to stay away \nfrom this area that \nalso \ncontains the carotid artery and major nerves. \niv Side of the neck: Not quite \nas sensitive as the \nfront of \nthe \nneck, \nyou \nshould still treat delicately. \nV \nThe \"ear notch\": \nJust behind your jawbone and beneath your ear you find a little notch. It's not a good idea \nto jam a  finger into this notch, unless you're trying to extort money or favors from \nthe person receiving the \nmassage, as it \ncontains \na sensitive \nfacial nerve. \nv The eyeball: \nUnless you're trying to do a \nThree Stooges massage \n(popular amongst college \nmales). don't \npoke your fingers directly into the person's eyes. \nv Th\ne exilic \nThis is a fancy term for the armpit \nwhich, as you \nknow, is a  sensitive \narea, filled \nwith nerves, \narteries, and lymph glands. Not to mention, most people are very ticklish there. \nv The upper inner arm: Just down from the armpit, along the inside of the \nupper arm, is a sensitive, \nnerve \nfilled area along \nthe length \nof the arm \nbone. Pressing \nhere too \nfirmly gives you that yucky•nervy feeling. \nV The ulnar notch of the elbow: Otherwise known as \nthe \"funny bone,\" this spot contains the ulnar nerve \nwhich, if \nyou touch it too hard, \ncauses normally discrete \npeople to curse in \nseveral \nlanguages. \nv The \nabdomen: Houdini was \nkilled by \nan \nunexpected \npunch \nto this area, which is filled with many squishy \nimportant bits known as organs. Be especially gentle around the upper abdomen along the ribs, where you \nfind the liver, gall bladder, and spleen. \nv The \nlower back: Just to both sides of the spine, and \nbelow the \nribs, is where \nyou find \nthe \nkidneys. Don't \npress too hard here or pound on them. Kidneys don't like it when you do that. \nv \nThe \nfemoral \ntriangle: Not to be \nconfused \nwith the Bermuda triangle, \nthis area is \noften referred \nto \nas the \n\"groin.\n- It's \nthe \ninner part of the line in \nfront \nwhere your leg \nmeets your \nbody. If you press \ntoo hard here \nyou can actually cut off circulation to the leg. \n3 \nPopliteal area: Popularly known as the back of the \nknee, \nyou should always treat this spot gingerly. It's \nvery \nsensitive to pressure. \nVI\nv \nw \nW W V \nCopyright O \n199916G \nBooks \nWorldwide, Inc. \nAll rights reserved. \nCheat \nSheet \nass \nvalue. \nItem \n51724 \nFot \nmore \ninformation \nabout \n106 \nBooks, \ncall 1400-7624971 \n...For Dummies \n: Bestsetting Book \nSeries (or \nBeginners \nEFTA00008022\n\nPraise \nFor \nMassage \nFor \nDummies \n\"Touch \nis \na \npowerful \ntool \nin \nany \nrelationship, \nand \nlearning \nto \nuse \nthat \npower \nwith \n, \nwisdom, \ncompassion \nand \nskill \nis \nwhat \nMassage \nFor \nDummies \nis \nall \nabout. \nI \nrecommend \nthis \nbook \nfor \neveryone \nwho \nwould \nlike \nto \nmake \nthe \nart \nof \nmassage \na \npart \nof \ntheir \nlives.\" \n—John \nCray, \nauthor, \nMen \nAre \nFrom \nMars, \nWomen \nAre \nFrom \nVenus \n- \nThe \nonly \nbad \nthing \nabout \nthis \nbook \nis \nthat \nSteve \nCapellini \nno \nlonger \nworks \nat \na \nspa \nwhere \nI \ncan \nget \nhis \nrevitalizing \nmassage. \nLearning \nhow \nto \nget \nthe \nbenefits \nat \nhome \nthrough \nMassage \nFor \nDummies \nis \nthe \nnext \nbest \nthing \nto \nbeing \nIn \nSteve's \nhand.\" \n—Bernard \nBurt, \nauthor \nof \nFodor's \nHealthy \nEscapes \nand \nSenior \nEditor \nSpa \nManagement \nJournal \n\"I \nhave \nlong \nrecommended \nmassage \nas \nan \nimportant \ningredient \nof \na \nholistic, \nself\n-\nnurturing \nlifestyle. \nFinally, \nthere \nis \na \nbook \nfor \nthe \naverage \nperson \nthat \ngives \nyou \nevery-\nthing \nyou \nneed \nto \nknow \nabout \ngiving \nand \nreceiving \nmassages. \nI \nhighly \nrecommend \nthis \nbook.\" \n—Jack \nCanfield, \nco-author \nof \nthe \nChicken \nSoup \nfor \nthe \nSoul \nseries \nI've \nreceived \nmassage \nfrom \nexperts \naround \nthe \nworld \nand \nhave \nbecome \nsomewhat \nof \nan \nexpert \nin \nthe \nart \nof \nreceiving. \nSteve \nCapellini \nIs \ndefinitely \nthe \n'best \nof \nthe \nbest.' \nand \nI've \nbeen \none \nof \nthe \nmost \nloyal \nclients \nfor \nover \ntwelve \nyears \nnow. \nIf \nreaders \nof \nMotown\nFor \nDummies \ncome \naway \nwith \neven \na \nsmall \nfraction \nof \nthe \nskills \nand \nknowledge \nhe's \nshared \nwith \nme \nover \nthe \nyears, \nthey'll \nbe \nwell \non \ntheir \nway \nto \nsome \nof \nthe \nmost \nincredi-\nbly \nhealthy, \nrelaxing, \nand \nspiritually \nnourishing \nexperiences \nof \ntheir \nlives. \nEnJoyr \n—Phyllis \nSandler \n\"Massage \ntherapy \nhits \nthe \nbig \ntime! \nWhat \na \nwonderful \napproach \nto \nthe \nart \nand \nscience \nof \nmassage. \nMassage \nFor \nDummies \nblends \nfactual \ninformation \nwith \na \ngood \nsense \nof \nhumor. \nEven \nthough \nwe've \nbeen \nin \npractice \nfor \nover \ntwenty \nyears, \nwe \ncouldn't \nput \nIt \ndown. \nWe \nhighly \nrecommend \nthe \nbook \nto \nlaypeople \nas \nwell \nas \nthose \nIn \nthe \nfi\neld.\" \n—Dan \n& \nTekla \nUlrich, \nSuncoast \nSchool \nof \nMassage, \nTampa, \nFlorida \n\"Massage \nFor \nDwnmies \nis \nan \neasy \nread: \ndelightfully \nfunny, \nthought\n-provoking \nwithout \nany \nwork \non \nthe \npart \nof \nthe \nreader. \nThere \nis \na \nwealth \nof \ninformation \nthat \nis \nalmost \nauto \nmatically \nabsorbed. \nSteve \nis \na \nborn \nteacher. \nThe \nauthors \nuse \nhumor \nand \nwit \nto \nhelp \nyou \nunderstand \nthe \nmany \nfacets \nof \nmassage. \nThey \nhelp \nyou \nvisualize \nthe \nmaterial \nand \nsee \nthe \nadvantages \nof \ntouching \nand \nbeing \ntouched. \nWith \na \nsingle \npen \nswipe, \nthey \ndestroy \n. \nmyths, \ncreate \nmirth, \nand \nfoster \ncuriosity. \nThe \nbook \nis \nwell\n-designed \nfor \neasy \naccess \nto \ntechnically \nsound \nmaterial, \nand \ncan \nbe \nused \nas \na \nreference, \nquick \nread, \nor \na \nteaching \n• \ntext \nfor \na \nwide \naudience. \nI \nhave \nover \ntwenty. \nfi\nve \nyears \nin \nthis \nbusiness, \nand \nI \nwas \nenter-\ntained, \nlaughed \na \nlot, \nand \nappreciated \nthe \nauthors' \ntechniques \nand \ncompetent \nteaching \nmethods.\" \n—Nancy \nW. \nDail, \nLMT, \nDirector, \nDowneast \nSchool \nof \nMassage \n- \nEFTA00008023\n\ntapellini and Van \nWelden literally take their readers by the hand and gently lead them \ninto the delightful practicalities of massage.

I'm of course talking about massage. \nLogging 20,000 miles a year may \nhave made me somewhat of an \nexpert on the lifestyles of the rich and famous, but it also taught \nme to value some of life's simple pleasures, like massage. \nWhenever I arrive at a new destination, be it the Oriental Hotel in \nBangkok, Thailand, or the \nCanyon Ranch Spa at the Venetian in Las \nVegas, the first thing I do after I check in is escape to a good \nmas-\nsage. \nIt's the only cure for whatever ails you. Being a devotee of the \nart of a good massage, my mania isn't \nconfined to Just when I'm \ntraveling. I have a massage table in my home in Jumby Bay, \nAntigua, and \nSueHua, my Chinese \nmasseuse, is \na \ndaily treat.... \nPerhaps the best thing about \nmassage \nis that \nabsolutely everyone \ncan enjoy it, recreating one of the greatest pleasures of the jet-set \ncrowd right at home. And now, finally, there's a way for all of us to \nlearn the secrets from one of the great masters of massage, Steve \nCapeRini. This book reveals dozens of healthy tips to help you \nachieve inner harmony, peace of mind, and an entirely new level of \nwell-being, whether you're receiving your massage at a \ngreat \nluxury hotel on \nthe island of Maui, or on your very own living room \nfloor. \nMassage is truly one of the greatest gifts that is a \ndelight to receive \nand a joy \nto give. Have fun as you read along and practice because \nyou may even \nmake a few new friends. \nRobin Leach \nEFTA00008045\n\nAtni \nMassage For \nDummies  \nEFTA00008046\n\nIntroduction \nF\nn\nor\nthose \nof \nus \nwho've \nalready \ndiscovered \nit, \nmassage \nIs \njust \nabout \nthe \nniftiest \nthing \non \nthe \nplanet. \nBetter \nthan \nchocolate. \nBetter \nthan \npizza. \nIt's \na \ngreat \nway \nto \nfeel \nbetter, \nlook \nbetter, \ntreat \npeople \nbetter, \nand \ntreat \nyourself \nbetter, \ntoo. \nIt's \none \nhundred \npercent \ngood \nfor \nyou, \nwith \nno \nartificial \nadditives \nor \ningredients, \nand \nit's \neasy \nto \ndo. \nIn \nfact, \none \nof \nthe \nbest \nthings \nabout \nmas-\nsage \nis \nthat \nyou \ndon't \nneed \na \nlot \nof \nfancy \nexpensive \nequipment \nin \norder \nto \nget \none \nor \ngive \none. \nAll \nyou \nreally \nneed \nto \nget \nstarted \nis \na \nhuman \nbody. \nGot \none? \nGreat! \nThen \nyou're \nready \nto \ngo. \nFirst, \nlet \nme \nintroduce \nmyself \nand \nexplain \nwhat \nqualifies \nme \nto \nteach \nyou \nabout \nthis \nsubject \nin \nthe \nfirst \nplace. \nI've \nbeen \nmassaging \npeople \nfor \na \nliving \nsince \nI \nwas \n23 \nyears \nold. \nThat's \nmore \nthan \n16 \nyears \nand \nwell \nover \n10,000 \nmassages. \nI've \ntrained \nother \nmassage \ntherapists \naround \nthe \nworld \nat \nresorts, \nin \nwork-\nshops, \nand \nin \nmassage \nschools, \nand \nI've \nwritten \na \nfew \nbooks \non \nthe \nsubject. \nBut \nthere's \nsomething \nmore \nto \nit \nthan \nthat. \nIf \nall \nI \nwere \noffering \nyou \nwas \ntech-\nnical \nexperience, \nanalytical \nknowledge, \nand \nrah\n-rah \nenthusiasm, \nI \nwouldn't \nblame \nyou \nfor \napproaching \nthis \nbook \nwith \nindifference \nor \neven \nboredom. \nYet \nanother \nbook \nabout \nthe \nbeauties \nand \nwonders \nof \nmassage \nstrokes \nand \nmaneuvers? \nWax \non, \nwax \noff. \nYawn. \nThe \nMassage \nAdventure \nWhat \nI \nhope \nto \noffer \nyou \nis \nmore \nthan \ntechnique, \nmore \nthan \nknow-how, \neven \nmore \nthan \nincreased \npleasure \nand \ngreater \nhealth \nin \nyour \neveryday \nlife. \nWhat \nI \nwill \nbe \ntrying \nto \nget \nacross \nin \nall \nof \nthe \npages \nto \nfollow \nis \na \nnew \nway \nto \nbe. \nI've \ntransformed \nmy \nown \nlife \ninto \nan \nongoing, \nunfolding \nmassage \nadventure \nand \nwould \nbe \nmost \nsincerely \nhonored \nto \nact \nas \nyour \nguide \nalong \na \nsimilar \njourney \nof \ninner \nand \nouter \nexploration. \nThere's \na \nbig, \nwild \nworld \nout \nthere, \nand \nthere's \nan \neven \nbigger, \nwilder \nworld \ninside \nyour \nown \nbody \nand \nmind. \nMassage \nis \nan \nexcellent \nvehicle \nthrough \nwhich \nto \nexplore \nboth. \nTouching \nother \npeople \nwith \nthe \nintention \nof \nmaking \nthem \nfeel \nbetter \nand \nimproving \nthe \nquality \nof \ntheir \nlives \nis \none \nof \nthe \nmost \nworthy \nways \nto \nspend \none's \ntime \nas \na \nhuman \nbeing. \nMassage, \nin \nthis \nsense, \nIs \nmore \nthan \na \nJob. \nIt's \na \ncalling, \na \ncause, \na \nmission. \nI \nrealize, \nof \ncourse, \nthat \nthis \nmay \nsound \na \ntad \noverzealous. \nNot \neverybody \nfeels \nthis \nway, \nwhich \nis \ngood \nbecause \nif \nthey \ndid \nEFTA00008047\n\n2 \nMassage For Dummies \nfeel this way, then they'd all be massage therapists like me, and there would \nbe nobody \nleft to \ndo other important \nJobs \nlike delivering \noffice \nfurniture, \npiloting commercial \nairplanes, and making incorrect predictions about the \nstock market. \nBut regardless of their \"real\" jobs, whether they know it or not, everybody in \nthis world is a living, breathing massage sponge. Take you, for example. \nRight \nnow, before you get to the next paragraph, take a moment to become aware \nof your body. Where are you? What \nis touching you? A chair on your bottom? \nA bed on your whole backside? A carpeted floor pressing against your feet? \nSomewhere, something is touching you, unless you are reading this introduc-\ntion to Massage For Dummies in free fall during a skydiving expedition (In \nwhich case your clothing and the harness over your shoulders are still touch-\ning you, not to mention the \nfriction of the air rushing by). In fact, this entire \nworld is reaching out and massaging you 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nGravity is the grip, and everything else is the hand. \nThose people with a more spiritual bent may even be tempted to say that \n\"God\" or the \"Supreme Being\" or the \"Ultimate Massage \nTherapist\" is touch-\ning us all the time, as \nreflected in mystical songs throughout the ages, such \nas the ancient Gregorian chant, Omnis Mundus In Manus Hobe°, which, \nroughly translated, means \"He's got the whole world in His \nhands. He's got \nthe whole \nwide world....\" \nYou're not atone \nThe world is filled with millions of people who have already \nstarted their own \nmassage adventures. \nIn fact, in the U.S. alone, approximately 28 million \npeople have received a professional massage, and that number is growing \nquickly. Millions more have exchanged massages on a \nnon-professional basis \nwith friends and family. \nInsurance companies are starting to reimburse for it, \ndoctors are Including it in their practices, and practically every hair salon in \nevery city is turning Into a day spa and offering massage to clients. \nYou've \nprobably seen massage on shows like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. It's \neverywhere, and yet, if you're like most people, you still \nhaven't received a \nmassage, and you have \nquite a few questions about \nhow it works \nand \nwhat it \ncan do \nfor you. If that's the case, then this is the book \nfor you. \nYou don't have to be a hippie \nLet me reassure you right here at the beginning that I'm not going to \nask you \nto do anything you're \nuncomfortable with. In fact, if you want to receive a \nmassage while \nwearing a formal, ankle-length ball gown or a \nfootball uniform \nEFTA00008048\n\n \nIntroduction \n3 \ncomplete with pads, that's \nfine with me. It may cut \ndown on the effectiveness \nof certain \nmassage techniques, but \nI'm not here to tell you \nwhat your style \nshould be. I'm \nhere to help you feel \ncomfortable about including massage in \nyour life in whatever ways you see fit. \nIn this book, you're \ngoing to find lots of ways to \nmake massage a part \nof your \nday-to-day activities so that it \nbecomes as natural as \nbrushing your teeth, dri-\nving your car, \nor peeling the stickers off \nsales items you buy as \nChristmas \npresents. And in order to help \nyou accomplish this, I've \nenlisted the help of a \npretty impressive \ncharacter, my \nco-author, Michel Van Welden. \nFirst of all, \nyou should know that \nMichel is a man. In \nFrance, where he's from, many \nmen \nare \ncalled Michel. He's a physical \ntherapist and naturopathic \ntherapist who's \ntraveled the world \nteaching other therapists and \nphysicians about massage. \nAn expert on physiology \nand the skin, he has been \npersonally responsible for \ngetting the \nFDA in this country to sit up \nand pay serious attention to \nthe \neffects of certain kinds of \nmassage. The way he \naccomplished this was \nthrough \nseveral highly complex \nlaboratory experiments studying \n(I'm not \nmaking this up) the \neffects of massage on \npigs. I defer to \nMichel's clinical \nexpertise on many \ncrucial issues, and my hope \nis that his scientific \nknowl-\nedge sets your \nmind at ease \nregarding the \neffectiveness and safety of \nmassage. \nThroughout your average, \neveryday \nparagraphs in this book, \nthough, it will be me, \nSteve, acting as your guide. \nTogether, Michel and I have \ncreated a book that \ngoes beyond any \nother of its kind to offer \nyou everything \nyou need \nto know to change \nyour life from a dull, \ndrab, non-massage \nexis-\ntence into an exciting massage adventure. \nThis Book \nIs for You \nIt... \nAs I \nstated earlier, this book \nis for anyone with a \nbody, which \nshould qualify \nalmost every \nsingle reader. \nDisembodied spirits and \npoltergeists may find it \ndifficult to get the \ncorrect amount of friction \nnecessary to perform \neffective \nmassage \nmaneuvers and should \ntherefore abstain. \nCertain people in \nparticu-\nlar will \nquickly discover the most \nobvious benefits in reading these \npages; \nyou \nknow who you are, and \nthis book is especially for \nyou if ... \n3 You've ever wanted to \ntouch another person with \ngrace, compassion, \nand \ncaring. \n3 You want to share a \nnew level of \ncommunication with the \npeople you're \nclose to. \n3 You want to increase \nyour well-being and reduce \nmany types of pain. \n3 You have a desire to \nenhance various aspects of your life, \nincluding ath-\nletic \nperformance, job efficiency, and \neven your love life. \n3 You have a handicap of some kind \nand would like to discover how in \nfact massage is the \ntherapy of choice for many people with physical \nlimitations. \nEFTA00008049\n\n4 \nMassage For \nDummies \n3 You want to pursue this adventure more \nseriously and are perhaps \nthinking about becoming a massage pro yourself. \n3 You think knowing how to give a good massage may be a neat way to get \nmore dates. \nSo How Do I Get Started Already) \nBy now you're probably saying, \n\"Alright, Steve. You've convinced me. My \nmuscles are sore and I'm ready to get going. How do I get \nstarted with this \nwhole massage thing anyway?\" \nThe best way to use this book Is to choose the subject that interests you \nmost and then \njump right in at that point. Many of you may be eager to start \ngiving a massage right away, in which case, you can zoom ahead to Part Ill.

So, you might ask, if massage is so \ndam popular and \neveryone loves It so much, why haven't \nI been informed? \nIn \nthis part ... \nDon't feel bad. You're in the majority. Most people have no \ndue about the rich tradition that \nmassage has to offer, and \nthat's because they were \nnever taught by their parents, or \ntheir peers, or a respected teacher in grade school. Learning \nmassage is kind of like learning \ngeometry, or your ABCs. If \nno one teaches you, how \nare you supposed to find out? \nThere are \ncertain controversies that \nstill swarm around \nthe whole issue of \nmassage, most of them based on \nideas \nheld-over from the Victorian age. In this first part of the \nbook, I'm going \nto completely quash all such concerns into \nlittle tiny \nbits, leaving you with a jaw-agape \nappreciation \nfor the tremendous benefits massage can \nhave for you, \nyour family, and \nfriends. \nWhether you're already somewhat \nfamiliar with massage \nand are raring to \ngo, or you're a trembling neophyte, \nslightly \nintimidated by the very \nconcept of touching \nanother person, or being touched, \nPart I will quickly usher \nyou into a \nnew world filled with the millions of us who \nalready know and enjoy the many \nbenefits of massage. \nWelcome to the club. \nEFTA00008056\n\nChapter 1 \nNot Just a Rub: How Massage \nCan Improve Your Life \n0 OOOOOOOOO 0 • • • 0 OOOOO G 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nIn This Chapter \nD \nWhat makes massage \nwork \np. Types of massage and how they help you \nWhatdoes massage really do for you anyway? Sure, it feels incredible to \nreceive one, and it looks nice to watch beautiful people massaging \neach other on how-to videos, but what's going on beneath the surface? Is it \nworth it to actually \nfork over your hard-earned cash to have someone rub \nyour skin for an hour? Should you spend your precious time and energy \nlearning how to give a good massage yourself? Is massage \nreally effective, or \nis It Just an unnecessary, flashy indulgence, like fish eggs on toast? \nWell, being a \nmassage junkie \nmyself, I \nfind it \ndifficult \nto imagine why \nanybody \nwould not want to get a massage, anytime, \nanyplace, for any reason at all or \nno reason at all. For me, massage has just always seemed like such an obvi-\nously good thing to \ndo, \nstarting way back in 11th grade \nwhen Grace \ncame \nover to visit at my parent's house one \nafternoon, and nobody else was home. \nBeing a typical seventeen-year-old, I was hoping that we were soon \ngoing to \nengage in some good old-fashioned hanky-panky, and when Grace told me to \nloosen my belt and lie down on the carpet, I began singing \nHandel's Messiah \nsilently to myself. \nGrace touched me then, on the small of my back, and I'll never \nforget the sen-\nsation. \"This \nis \na massage technique \nthat somebody \ntaught me,\" she \nsaid. \n\"How does it feel?\" \n\"Ah, it feels, um, kind of, uh, unbelievable!\" I said, and unbelievable was \nexactly the right word. Grace \nwas doing something clearly non\n-sexual, and I \ncould not believe that anything \nnon-sexual could feel so good. I could not \nEFTA00008057\n\n12\n \nPart I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health \nand Happiness  \nbelieve that there was a way to be so \nintimate with somebody and yet not get \nin trouble with her father, if he were to find out about it. In short, I could not \nbelieve \nthat something \nthat was \nneither \nillegal, \nimmoral, nor \nfattening could \nbe so \nsumptuously pleasurable. \nI asked Grace to keep doing what she was doing, and as she did so, \nI began \ndevising, right there with my face buried in my parent's green shag carpeting, \na future lifestyle that would include \nthe absolutely highest number of mas-\nsages \npossible. \nThis early experience pointed out a fundamental truth about massage ther-\napy, but one that is often missed by those people who judge it \nbefore they \neven give it a try. That truth: There is a difference between sex and massage \ntherapy. There, I said it, right here in Chapter 1, and I'm glad. Some people \nout there will forever be mixing the two up, which does a disservice to every-\nbody else, especially those \npeople who have shied away from massage over \nthe years because of a perceived less-than-pristine image. \nI discovered, in that youthful, eye-opening \nexperience, that massage does \nindeed feel unbelievable, and that discovery was a great place to \nbegin. Now, \nmore than 20 years later, after studying massage and teaching massage and \nexperiencing the \nmyriad facets of \nmassage both in \nthe U.S. and \nin other coun-\ntries, I've been \nintroduced to other, deeper reasons for including it in my life, \nreasons with profound implications for improved health, well-being, and \neven \nlongevity. These are the reasons I'd like to share with you in this chapter and \nthroughout the \nbook. \nBasic 13enetits of \nMassage \nIf I were to go Into some of the stories about how massage has helped people \nchange their lives, heal themselves, \nbecome rich and famous, and \nsoon, \nyou \nprobably wouldn't believe me right away, because, after all, we're still in \nChapter 1. So I'm going to start out slowly and offer you some of the simplest, \neveryday ways that massage can help you, some of which still may come as a \nsurprise to \nyou. \nHere, then, not ranked in any particular order, are some basic benefits of \nmassage that perhaps didn't pop \nstraight into your head the first time you \nhought about it. \nMassage ... \n0\n 3 Helps \nrelieve \nmuscular spasm \nand \ntension \n3 Raises \nimmune efficiency \nEFTA00008058\n\nFigure 1-1: \nThe limp \nrope is your \nmuscle.

Increases healthy functioning of the skin \nko Engenders profound relaxation \n1.0 Offers emotional reassurance \nso' Improves appearance \nI d like to take these points one at a time and let you get comfortable with them. \nHelps relieve muscular spasm and tension \nAs you can see in Figure 1-1, there is a definite physical difference between \nmuscles that are relaxed and happy and muscles that are tensed up due to \nstress, overuse, injury, and more. \nBut \nthere's more to it than that, believe it or not. \nRegardless of how \nwickedly clever \nmy rope analogy is, the human body \nis much more com-\nplex. In fact, it's so complex that nobody has \ncompletely figured it out yet, \neven though countless researchers have spent a lifetime trying to \ndo so. A \nwhole bunch of really interesting things about \nthe body \nhave been \ndiscov-\nered, however, along with how it responds to various types of \nstimuli, \nincluding massage. \nFor example, one of the most direct effects of massage is to help loosen the \ntension we experience as knots, kinks, and spasms in \nour muscles. This is \nachieved in a number of ways: \n1 \n73\nEFTA00008059\n\n14\n   Part I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health and Happiness  \n3 The application of pressure creates awareness that there is \nindeed ten-\nsion in a particular area, and the person receiving the massage can then \nbegin to consciously \nrelease that tension. \n3 Through the \napplication of friction to the area, a thermodynamic effect \ntakes place, warming and softening the tight, haid tissue. \n3 \nBy stimulating trigger points, \nthe local nerves are soothed, allowing a \nrelease of contractions. \nRaises immune efficiency \nDid you know that there is a vast system of vessels running through your \nbody, roughly parallel to your circulatory system, and that this system is \nfilled with a fluid that is responsible for carrying away and eliminating many \nof the organisms, bacteria, viruses, and other microscopic bad guys that \nmight otherwise attack you? Yes, it's true. This is the lymph system, otherwise \nknown as the Canadian Mounties of your body. \nYour lymph system has nodes at various strategically located areas through-\nout your body, and these nodes have the job of capturing the invaders and \nprocessing them before eventual expulsion through your excretory system. \nNow, you may be wondering, how the heck does this lymph fluid get pumped \nthrough your body anyway? Funny you should ask. I've devised a test to dis-\ncern your knowledge on that very subject. \nHoly anatomy quiz, \nBatman! \nThat's right, but it's just a one-question quiz, so don't let your anxiety levels \nrise too \nhigh over it. Here we \ngo: \nQuestion: How does the body pump the critically important lymph fluid \nthrough its lymph vessels, keeping your \ninner ocean clean and healthy? \na. The heart pumps the lymph, just like it pumps the blood. \nb. The centrifugal force from riding various carnival rides is the \nbest way \nto get the \nlymph fluid moving. \nc. Fear caused by sudden, unexpected physical proximity to vampires or \nwerewolves causes the lymph vessels to contract, circulating the fluid. \nd. Movement, muscular contraction, and massage therapy are the ways \nlymph fluid \nis most \neffectively \nmoved through \nthe \nbody because the \nlymph \nsystem \nhas no pump of \nits \nown, such as \nthe heart. \nRight! The answer is \nd. By \nhelping your \nbody \ncirculate this lymph fluid, mas-\nsage aids in the \nelimination of \nnoxious invaders (toxins) \nfrom your body. \nEFTA00008060\n\nChapter 1: Not Just a Rub: How Massage Can Improve Your Life \nOur neglected muscles \nEven though you have over 600 muscles that \ntake up.approximately 60 percent of your \nbody \nweight, they sometimes \nget neglected, espe-\ncially when it comes to your average physician. \nFor example, many times after serious trauma, \nsuch as a  car accident, physicians perform \nappropriate procedures to save the life of the \ninjured.person and to repair any gross damage. \nThen physical therapists take over to help \nrestore as much use and feeling to the affected \nareas as possible. What happens, though, when \nthat person returns to his physician or physical \ntherapist six months later complaining of \nchronic pain? If no further operations are war-\nranted, and continued physical therapy doesn't \nseem to help, there are only two choices as far \nas most physicians are \nconcerned: \n3 \nPrescribe drugs \n3 Counsel stoicism \nThat's right, the only two \nchoices are to either \nmask the pain or learn to live \nwith it In the mas-\nsage model, though, something restorative can \nbe done with \nthat 60 percent of  your body \nknown as soft tissue to bring about relief. \nThere are other factors at play, too, in massage's effectiveness as \nan immune \nbooster. As reported in LIFE magazine (August 97), studies in orphanages \nhave \nshown that infants and children \ndeprived of touch experience stunted \ngrowth, both emotionally and \nphysically. Further study showed that \ntouch \npromotes the release of human growth \nhormone (HGH), which is essential to \nour development. If a child is not \ntouched sufficiently, his or her develop-\nment will be stunted, and \nsusceptibility to disease will be \nIncreased, with \npotentially catastrophic results. Many of the \nuntouched children in orphan-\nages have died for lack of simple contact. \nImprocles \ncirculation \nThis \nis the reason that the cigar-smoking \noctogenarians who frequented old-\nfashioned health spas used to give \nfor receiving massage: \"It's \ngood for the \ncirculation!\" they'd say. And \nthey were right. \nStudents in massage school are taught to \nalways \nmassage in \nthe \ndirection \nof circulation, toward the \nheart, whenever they're applying \nenough pres-\nsure \nto move \nthe blood \nunderneath the \nskin. The \nreason for this \nis that \nyour veins have little \none-way valves in them \nthat \nkeep \nblood \nfrom \ngoing \nback in the wrong direction. So obviously it's not a \ngood idea to push the \nblood back \nagainst these valves, potentially harming them. In fact, when \nthese valves don't work properly on \ntheir \nown, \nthe blood \nseeps backward \n1 \n15 \nEFTA00008061\n\n76\n Part I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health and Happiness  \nand pools up, causing the appearance of varicose veins, which are a con-\ntraindication \nfor massage, but I'm skipping ahead to Chapter 10 already. \nSorry \nabout that. \nYou have the idea: Some massage movements physically push the blood \naround in its vessels and can therefore, when done properly, push it in the \nright \ndirection, improving circulation. \nMassage also draws more blood to the surface of the body and into areas of \nrelatively poorer circulation, thus bringing with it much-needed oxygen and \nother nutrients for the tissues. \nPromotes the healing of tissues \nThis benefit is primarily a result of the previous two. By helping to bring \nnutrient-rich blood into areas that are recovering from any type of problem, \nand by helping to cleanse these same areas of toxins (by stimulating the \nlymph system), massage promotes quicker healing. \nAlso, certain types of massage stretch and soften tissues in traumatized \nareas, helping them regain natural elasticity and strength faster. \nBut \nbeware: You definitely don't want to rush straight in and massage your \ncousin John's swollen knee after his recent surgery unless you've been \ntrained in bona-fide massage classes and know what you're doing. \nIncreases healthy functioning of the \nskin \nThe skin is where \nmassage has its most pronounced \neffects. In fact, I've \ndevoted the whole of Chapter 3 to it. So let \nme just say here that massage \nincludes several \nactions that leave the skin silky, vibrant, and fully function-\ning in both directions. By that I mean it \npromotes the shedding of dead cells \nwhile also encouraging the \nabsorption of moisture, nutrients, vitamins, and \nother vital elements, especially when the massage is given with the aid of \ncreams, oils, and lotions created for \njust that purpose. \nIn this sense, massage helps the skin \"breathe.\" Just as our lungs breathe \nboth in and out, inhaling and exhaling, healthy skin must breathe in both \ndirections, too, and massage can \nhelp with that. \nEFTA00008062\n\nChapter 1: Not Just a Rub: How \nMassage Can \nImprove \nYour \nLife \nOffers emotional reassurance \nIn a famous experiment conducted by some \ntruly sadistic researchers, some \nunfortunate little monkeys were \nbrought up In cages with surrogate mothers. \nEach monkey had two mothers In the cage with him. One was a rag doll and \nthe other was \na hard wire shell. The uncomfortable wire mother had a nipple \nwith real milk coming out, but the rag doll mother had no nipples and no \nmilk. The researchers shocked the monkeys, \nthen they sat back with smug-\nresearcher-expressions on their faces to see what would happen. In every \ncase, when they were desperate for comfort and safety, the monkeys scam-\npered straight over to rag-doll-mommy, regardless of the fact that she had \nnever provided any other kind of food or sustenance beyond the fact of \nbeing \nsoft and cuddly. \nThis brings us to an Important \nrealization as far as humans are concerned, \ntoo: Almost every person alive, when shocked, would rather squeeze a rag \ndoll than a hard wire shell with a nipple attached. This bit of information, I've \nfound, makes a fascinating ice-breaker at cocktail parties. \nExtrapolating from this data, the researchers were able to conclude, with a \ngood degree of confidence, \nthat tactile sensations are the most Important fac-\ntors involved with emotional comforting. \nMassage, by offering a sustained, intentional, caring form of tactile \nstimula-\ntion, is one of the best ways to \nimpart emotional reassurance, and emotional \nreassurance just may be the \nnumber one need of humans in the \ntwenty-first \ncentury. We modern urban dwellers are all a bunch of shocked \nmonkeys \nsearching for \nMom, basically. And massage is the ultimate rag doll. \nEngenders \nprofound relaxation \nDr. Robert \nBenson of Harvard wrote in The Relaxation \nResponse that by \nrepeating certain breathing arid \nconcentration exercises, people could \ngreatly \nreduce their levels of stress. \nMassage, by its very nature, \ninduces a similar \nresponse. It's a mini-vacation that you can take \nright there inside your own \nbody. No need to \nbuy expensive plane \ntickets or submit \nyourself \nto \nthe has-\nsles \nof taxi rides and hotel \nrooms.

Instead, what I'm doing here \nis \nexplaining \nthe generic types of massage, \nbroken down into \ncategories \nbased on the observable effects they can have in \nyour own life. \nThink of this section like the menu in a \nrestaurant. Each category (breakfast, \nlunch, dinner) consists of distinctly \ndifferent dishes, and yet the foods used \nto prepare the dishes can be the same. So the same eggs used to make your \nomelet at breakfast can \nbe used in your egg salad at lunch or your dessert \nafter \ndinner. It's the same with the following categories of massage. \nAny par-\nticular massage technique can be used to create \nvarious effects. \nEFTA00008064\n\nChapter 1: Not \nJust a Rub: \nHow \nMassage Can \nImprove \nYour \nLife \nWhen you head into Chez Massage, \nyou can \norder a\n-la\n-carte or \nrequest \na pre-\narranged sampling of \nofferings, like on a prix-fixe menu.

The \nimpromptumaneu-\nvers he \nmade up at that point \nconsisted of \nsimple, \nstraightforward rubbing \nand sliding. A trained massage therapist delivers quite a bit more effective-\nness than Sean did, but in essence, the \npurpose of the relaxation massage is, \nduh, to \nrelax. This is particularly helpful in these Instances: \n3 For stress relief, when the daily grind is just too much and the simple act \nof lying down and having someone \npay solicitous attention to you for an \nhour is enough to make a big difference. \n3 \nFor pampering, \nwhich is \nfine, \nas long as you don't \nfeel guilty \nabout it. \nSports massage \nJust ask the world-class \nathletes who travel with their own \npersonal massage \ntherapists.

The shaman's \nname was unintelligible to modern \nears, so we'll call him \nBob. \nHis fingers were working \nthe powerful ayuhasca vine, \nwhich gave his \npeople visions that \nhelped them to heal. Bob \nboiled the leaves and stems of \nthe \nvine in water with other plants, \nmaking a thick syrupy tea that \nhe brought \nwith him back into \nthe village. \nIt was night. The \nrainforest canopy above was \nfilled with the screeching \nsounds of life. Arranging the \nmembers of the tribe in \na circle around a fire he \nhad built, Bob gave them \neach sips of the tea, and they \nbegan to twirl and \ndance and sing traditional songs. \nSome of them, the ones who \nneeded healing \nthe most, fell into a trance, and Bob approached \nthem. \nAs the others \nwatched, Bob appeared to \nliterally reach into each person's \nbody with his fingers. Then \nhis fingers would flutter up toward the dark \nsky \nabove the fire. He would touch them, brush them off, \nshake their limbs, stay-\ning in almost constant \ncontact, and everyone could see (with \nthe help of the \nayuhasca) \nwhat Bob always saw — blurry \nspots where each person's body \nwas \nweak, demons of darkness clinging to a shoulder. \nAlthough Bob used powerful herbs and \njungle plants, his primary tool was \ntouch. The difference between a casual touch from another tribe \nmember and \nan intentional, focused touch from \nBob was sometimes the difference \nbetween life and death.

He also \nfounded the world's first \ngymnasium. \nThe \nMiddle \nAges \nNobody massaged anybody else (or was even allowed to touch much) during \nthe Middle Ages, which almost wiped out western civilization. \nLuckily, a few \nhardy souls decided, despite vigorous opposition, to sneak off and touch \neach other in barns, stables, and other hidden places whenever \npossible, \nthus \nassuring the \ncontinuation \nof the human \nrace and allowing \npeople a \nchance to practice rudimentary massage \ntechniques at the same time. \nNeedless to \nsay, the Middle Ages were not a good time to be a \nprofessional \nmassage therapist, and many of them \nsuffered extreme \ndeprivations.

Also, the earlier popularity \nOf massage \ninduced some \npeople to \ntry to make a \nprofit from it \nillicitly. \nAround \nthe turn \nof the \ncentury, \nseveral \nschools in Great Britain, for \nexample, \nwere turning out \npoorly trained \npractitioners, \nsome of whom ended up acting \nas prostitutes, \nwhich was \na big \ndownfall \nfor \nmassage. Since \nthe days of \nHippocrates, and \neven further back into the \nancient \nhistory of \nChina and \nIndia, massage had \nbeen \naccepted as a \nhealthy \npastime by a sizeable number of \npeople. Now, \nthings were different. \nMassaging \nCain and Abel \nPerhaps the discord in the massage world can \nbe \ntraced back to \nthe pair of American \nbrothers \nwho were responsible for bringing \nmassage to \nthe United States \nfrom \nSweden — \nCharles \nand \nGeorge Taylor. The Taylor brothers shared sim-\nilar interests, \nobviously; they both became \ndoctors, both \nwent to Europe to learn \nthese \nnew \ntechniques, and \nthey both wanted to spend \ntheir \nlives helping other people. But, as so often \nseems to \nhappen when people go \non a \nquest to \nhelp \nothers,They just couldn't seem to \nget \nalong \nthemselves. \nComing back to \nNew York in \nthe \n1850s, they \nopened a clinic together, but within a year they \ndissolved it and went their own ways. \n\"It's MYtechnique for helping other \npeople \nfeel \nbetter,\" said Charles, adjusting.his bowler hat \natop his head. \n\"No way, it's mine: replied \nGeorge, adjusting \nhis identical bowler cap. \n\"Mine? \n\"Mine.\" \nAnd thus started a problem that \nhas persisted to \nthis day, with various massage \ninnovators and \npractitioners teaching that their \nway is the best \nway.

Early \non, when Freud wanted to calm and reassure \nhis clients that he \nwas on their side, he used \nmassage.maneuvers primarily on their hands. \nUnfortunately, Freud left massage behind as he \nfurther developed his \npsychoanalytic tech-\nniques, perhaps out of a fear that he wouldn't be \nable \nto know what was \nreally working, talking \nor touching. But \nhe was greatly in \nfavor of it from \nthe \nstart. In the modern \nworld, many psycholo-\ngists \nare rediscovering the \npower of massage \nand incorporating \nit into their practice \nwith \nbody\n-centered \npsychotherapy and somatic \ntherapies. \nThroughout the mid-1900s, \nmany massage \ntherapists in the U.S. worked in a \nYMCA or a Turkish bath house \nand weren't expected to do \nmuch more than \npummel their \nvictims (er, clients) with some \nextraordinarily vigorous \nmaneu-\nvers, usually meant to purge \nthe recipient of excess \nalcohol and fatty acids \ningested \nthe night before. in fact, \nsome spa towns, such as Hot \nSprings, \nArkansas, had massage \nfacilities that were open on \nSunday mornings espe-\ncially \nfor this purpose.

But \neven in \nthe most remote areas there was a clamoring for things \nnew — vibrating mas-\nsagers instead of actual massages, \nfor instance — and as technological \nrevolution swept the planet, it left people high \nand dry as far as contact goes. \nThe human species was literally getting out of touch. \nAs always, when society swings too far In one direction, a mounting momen-\ntum tends to bring it back toward \nequilibrium. Somewhere in the 1960s, \npeople began to tire \nof the soulless sway of \nmachines and technology In their \nlives, and they started to \nreact against it. These revolutionaries were called \nhippies, or flower children, and they spread out from San Francisco to cover \nmuch of the world, toting with \nthem tie-dyed T-shirts, prayer beads, big black \nvinyl discs called \nalbums, and home made massage \ntables. \nEFTA00008074\n\n Chapter 2: A Brief \nHistory of Touch \n29 \nKeep in touch, \nLorraine \nThe hippie movement brought people back into \ntouch with themselves, \nas exemplified by the \nstory \nof  Lorraine, who, in 1968, couldn't decide \nexactly what to do with her life and so went off \nin search of something new in California, like so \nmany of her generation. \n\"I need to get in  touch with myself,\" intoned \nLorraine to anyone who asked her what she \nwas doing. Perhaps she didn't realize how pre-\ncise her choice of words truly was. \nHeading her \nfaded yellow \nVW Bug \nwest, with \n\"Go-Ask Alice\" playing over and over again.on \nthe eight-track tape \ndeck mounted under the \ndash, Lorraine kept driving and driving until \nshe \ncame to the remote spot on the winding high-\nway south of Big \nSur in California that so many \npeople had told \nher about \nThe place \nwas called the Esalen-Institute, andit \nwas a mecca for consciousness-raising \nwork-\nshops, research into \nalternative health, superb \nmassages and \nmassage \ninstruction, and just \nplain \nbrining \nout. People from all \nover the world \ncame to \nEsalen to get back in touch, literally, \nwith themselves and with life. Lorraine \nmoved \nin, \nstayed for five years, and by the time she left \nshe had found her calling in  life and \nbecamea \nmassage \ntherapist \nMassage \nToday \nThrough the years, massage has had a serious, multiple\n-personality disorder, \nkind of like Sybil. Every time you look at \nit, you're never sure exactly what \nyou're \ngoing to see. A Greek physician massaging athletes? A Swedish physio-\ntherapist \ncreating \nmovements to help ease common \nsuffering? A \nshaman \npurging evil spirits? A spiritual seeker sending healing vibrations through \nher \nfingers during an Esalen style massage at a spectacular seaside retreat? \nSo many \nchoices \nMassage is \nenjoying such a large renaissance \nright now, in \nfact, that \nat \ntimes \nthe market may appear \nglutted \nwith too many \nmassage \ntherapists. An \nalterna-\ntive newspaper In Asheville, North Carolina, for instance, printed a cartoon \nsummarizing the plight of that city's abundance of highly trained, under-\nemployed \nmassage therapists. \nThe \ncartoon showed \nan \nout-of\n-work therapist \nstanding at a corner holding up a \nsign: \"Will \nmassage for food.\" \nSo where \ndoes that leave \nyou as \nyou head \nout \nthe door \ntoday, \ntomorrow, or \nnext \nweek to go seeking \nyour own \nmassage \nexperiences? \nWell, you certainly \nEFTA00008075\n\n30\n Part I: Discovering Massage \nfor Greater Health and Happiness  \nhave a lot \nmore choices, which I clarify in Chapter \n9. You also have a lot more \nmassage therapists to choose \nfrom — somewhere between 30,000 \nand 50,000 \nnew massage \ntherapists in the U.S. each year, \nfor example. And France, which \nis not a huge \ncountry, has over 35,000 practicing kines, short for \nkinesiothera-\npeut, their term for massage/physical \ntherapist. These practitioners are \npopular, partly \nbecause insurance has covered \ntheir services since 1974; \npeople in France are \nused to receiving massage as part of their healthcare. \nAlthough you do have more \nchoices than ever, l think the \nassumption that \nwe're getting anywhere near a \ncritical mass of massage practitioners in the \nworld is \nmistaken. There are just too many people around \nthese days to mas-\nsage — over six billion of them \nas of August 1999 — and the \npopulation \ncontinues to \nexpand rapidly. \nWhat you can expect in terms \nof massage in the year 2000 \nand beyond is an \never-increasing number of choices, \nkind of like you find in those designer \ncoffee \nshops. Whereas before the choice used to be \nsimple — regular or \ndecal? — now you're faced \nwith an overwhelming array \nof mochas and \nfrappes and \nlattes and on and on. This \nphenomenon has been termed the \nStarbuckizing \nof massage. \nTouch research \nTo keep up with all the rapid changes \nand to document the effectiveness of \nmassage in \nthe midst of all these changes, \nsomebody had to start some seri-\nous research into the matter, and that's Just what they do at the Touch \nResearch Institute. \nIf you happen \nto live in South Florida, and you were to stroll down to the \nlocal medical center, you probably wouldn't be too \nsurprised to find some \nscientific studies being \nconducted in one of the buildings there. \nBut you may \nbe surprised to find that, instead of an \noperating room or a clinic, these stud-\nies are \nbeing conducted in softly lit chambers with flute music \nplaying in the \nbackground. And the subjects, instead of \nundergoing cutting-edge medical \ntechnologies, are \nreceiving the age-old techniques of \nmassage therapy. \nThe Touch Research Institute was founded in Miami in \n1992 to study the \neffects of touch on human \nbeings. Whereas the senses of \nsmell, hearing, \nsight, and taste all have had their \ninstitutes and studies for decades, poor \nlittle orphan touch was neglected until the 1990s. \nPerhaps touch was \nneglected because it is just so \nobvious. When you think \nabout it, nothing is not touch; \nyour body is a large antenna \nfeeling everything \nas it happens to you. The other senses \nall involve touch in one way or \nanother, too; molecules of \nvarious kinds hit you in the \ntaste buds, the optical \nnerves, the ear drums, and the nasal \npassages, which set off the sensations \nthat \nmake the senses work. \nEFTA00008076\n\n Chapter 2: A Brief \nHistory of Touch 31 \n• \nA \nmassage pilgrimage to Esalen \nThe pioneering work done at \nEsalen helped \nkeep massage alive and well after its decline in \nthe \nearly and mid-1900s. Esalen, located in Big \nSur, a couple hours south of San Francisco, was \nfounded by Michael Murphy in \n1962,.and some \nof the best massage teachers and researchers \nin the world have taught and worked there. The \nresult of \ntheir efforts has been a  shifting of the \nentire paradigm upon which massage is built \nNo longer \nsimply a \nremedial form \nof \n\"gymnas-\ntics\" to restore movement and ease pain, \nmassage has become \na wayto increase aware-\nness and sometimes even:eccess the spirit. \nIf you're passionate about learning \nwhat mas-\nsage can be on this spirit-enhancing level, \nyou \nmay want \nt0 \nmake a trip tothis massage\n-mecca \nyourself. Wherever you are in the \nworld, if you \nare a \nmassage lover, making your own \nmassage \npilgrimage \nto Esalen will \nbenefit your \nspiritl \nEsalen's \nlocation \nitself \nis spectacular, \nperched \nupon steep cliffs overhanging the Pacific \nOcean, where hot springs flow \nfrom the moun-\ntainside \ndirectly into a series of pools \nadjacent \nto the \nmassage \narea. \n(fisalen's Web site \nis \nat \nwww.esalen.org.) \nNudity alert Beware, Esalen is clothing \noptional, and nudity is common. \nThink otit as a  . \ngreat way to get used to viewing the grand mas-\nterpiece of the human \nbody. \nIn \n1998, two new Touch Research Institutes opened, one in the Philippines \nand one in \nFrance, \nwhich points \ntoward a \nglobalization of studies on mas-\nsage. How can they get away with testing massage like that, you ask? How \ncan \npeople just lie around feeling good and then \ncall it research? First of all, they \ndon't call \nit massage, but rather Tactile Kinesthetic Stimulation, which, trans-\nlated, means \"massage that someone can receive a \nmedical research grant \nfor.\" And the studies include \nextensive psychological tests, blood analysis, \ndouble-blind tests (tests in which neither the participants nor the \nresearchers know which subjects have a particular disease or condition \nand \nwhich don't), and a large amount of \npaperwork. So It's not just a big vacation. \nSome \nof the studies that have been done at \nthe Touch Research Institute \ninclude the following groups: \n3 HIV patients: \nSerotonin and \nkiller T-cells \nincreased \ndue to the \nmassage. \n3 \nPremature infants: \nMassaged Infants \ngained weight \nmore quickly \nand \nleft the \nhospital an \naverage of six \ndays \nearlier \nthan non\n-massaged \ninfants, at an average savings of $3,000. \n3 Depressed teenage \nmothers: Massage helped them gain self-confidence \nand \nprovided a \nway for them to connect \nwith \ntheir \nInfants. \n3 Children with post-traumatic shock \nsyndrome \nafter \nhurricane \nAndrew: \nMassage offered \npsychological reassurance \nthat the \nworld \ncould \nbe a safe place again. \n3 \nCancer \npatients: Researchers \nare still \ngathering \ndata about how \nmas-\nsage can help with this \ndisease. \nEFTA00008077\n\n32 \nPart I: Discovering \nMassage for Greater Health and \nHappiness  \nThe Future \nof Massage \nMany people are \nfamiliar with John Nalsbitt's book Megatrends, which dis-\ncusses \nthe problems people face as society heads \ninto an increasingly \ntechnological world. Naisbitt \nsays that as people get more high-tech, they \nhave to \nbecome equally high-touch as well. \nMassage, of course, is one obvious \nanswer to this dilemma. \nFollowing are examples \nof some high-touch trends \nthat show every sign of \ncontinuing into the future as \nmassage integrates more and more into soci-\nety's high-tech lifestyle: \n3 Diplomacy: Massage \ntherapists already travel around the world as \nambassadors of compassion. This trend will continue as \nhands-on tech-\nniques evolve and \ncross-cultural communication develops further. \n3 Performance: More and more \nperformers, athletes, and high-profile indi-\nviduals will \ndiscover the value and relevance \nof massage. Every \nprofessional sports \nteam, for example, will have massage therapists on \nstaff (many do already), creating a trickle\n-down effect as fans and the \ngeneral public \nbecome increasingly aware of \nmassage through the \nteam's example. \n3 Affordability: \nAs the world gradually shifts from a manufacturing-based \neconomy to an information- and services-based economy, the \ndemand \nfor massage will continue \nto grow. Employers and insurance \ncompanies \nwill be increasingly willing to pay for \nmassage services, which will benefit \nthe bottom \nline by reducing absenteeism, stress-related \ninjury, and so on. \n3 \nIncreased sophistication: Massage techniques (some \nof which have \nbeen around for centuries) will \nbecome more and more sophisticated \nas \npractitioners from \nvarious schools cross-train \nand add new skills to \ntheir repertoires. \nEFTA00008078\n\nChapter 3 \nYour \nSkin: \nFrontier to the \nRest of the World \n• 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nIn This \nChapter \np  Thinking with \nyour skin \np  Looking at your multidimensional skin \nor.

How do I know, you \nsk? I saw it in a Star Trek movie, so it must be true. In the movie, a \nwily \nalien treated Data, the android, to a taste of \nbeing human by grafting a swatch \nof flesh to his \nmechanical arm. He already had a brain and a fully functioning \nbody, but the one thing he lacked was \nsensation. He was Just a machine until \nhe had this little patch of skin attached to him, and with it, he became \nhuman. \nThe essence of being human \nis the ability to feel. \"But,\" you might respond, \"I \nfeel things in my mind and with my nerves, too, not just my \nskin. And \nbesides, can \nI really \ntrust Star Trek \nas a \nsource of \nanatomical \nknowledge?\" \nWell, guess what? In this \ncase, the \nwriters of Star \nTrek happened to \nbe \nright \non \nthe money. Your \nskin, \nyour nerves, and your \nmind are \nreally \njust \ndifferent \nlayers of the same thing. \nEFTA00008079\n\n34\n \nPart I: \nDiscovering Massage for \nGreater Health and \nHappiness  \nThinking \nWith pour \nSkin \nIn his book, Job's \nBody, Deane Juhan, a \nresearcher into the \neffectiveness of \nmassage \nand other touch \ntherapies, says, \n\"Depending upon how you \nlook at \nit, the skin is \nthe outer surface of the \nbrain, or the brain is \nthe deepest layer \nof the skin.\" \nThis assertion, \nthough it may seem \nabsurd initially, can be \nproven quite \neasily if you look closely at \nthe development of the \nembryo. As you \nknow, you \nstart out as a \nlittle clump of cells \ndeep in your mother's \nwomb. In the very \nfirst days after \nconception, these cells \nbegin to divide into \nthree distinct \nlayers that will later become \nyour body. The \nendoderm layer of cells eventu-\nally forms your \ninternal organs, the \nmesoderm forms the muscles \nand \nconnective tissues, and the \nectoderm forms the \nnervous system and the \nskin. \nAs the ectoderm cells \ndevelop, they gradually \nturn into your brain, \nspinal \ncord, \nnerves, and skin, which are \nreally all one unit. \n\"Nowhere along the line \ncan I draw a sharp \ndistinction between a \nperiphery which \npurely responds as \nopposed to a central \nnervous system which \npurely thinks\"(Juhan p. \n36). In \nother words, \nyour skin \"thinks\" as \nwell as feels, and your \nbrain \"feels\" as well \nas \nthinks. It's all one \nthing. And it starts \nat a very early age. \nIn fact, at six \nweeks and less than an inch \nlong, the little embryo \ncan already \"feel\" light \nstroking on its \nupper lip, which causes \na withdrawal reaction. \nFeeling = thinking \nImagine the \nfollowing sequence: \n1. Imagine a pinprick \nat a certain point on \nthe skin (Point A). \n2. Imagine the sensation \nthat travels up from the \nsensory receptor near \nthe \nskin's surface, to \nthe nerve, and then \non toward the \nspine, which it \nenters at Point B. From \nthere it continues up \nto the brain. \n3. \nImagine your brain \nprocessing this impulse \nsomewhere around \nPoint C, \nsending a \nfurther impulse to your \nmouth, which then \nsays \"ouch.\" \nSo the \nquestion is, at what point \ndoes the sensation of the \npinprick cause you \nto pull your skin \naway from the sharp object? \nA. \nAt point A, the \nexact moment the pin \npricks the skin. \nB. \nAt point B, a \nnanosecond later, when the \nsensation enters the \nspine. \nC. At point C, inside the \nbrain itself. \nD. None of the above. \nEFTA00008080\n\n Chapter 3: Your \nSkin: Frontier to the Rest of the World 35 \nThis question is tricky. Most people assume that the answer is C, inside the \nbrain, because that's where they think they have the thought, \"That hurts.\" But \nin actuality the answer is B, when entering the spine, for the following reason: \nYou pull yourself away from the pinprick as a result of a reflex arc at point B, \nwhich is an impulse that enters the \nspine and then shoots right back out \nagain in the \nform of a reaction. You actually experience the pulling \naway \nbefore your brain catches up to what's happening and \nyou say the word \n\"ouch.\" Ever notice that? For the same reason, your knee jerks when tapped \nwith a little rubber hammer, without your having time \nto think about it. So, in \nthis sense, your skin and nerves do the \"thinking\" for you. \nNote: Do not try this pinprick experiment at home on friends or family. I guar-\nantee that they won't appreciate it. \nInvestigating pour Multi-\ndinwnsionat Skin \n,c\noPINI04, \nIn his book, Touching: The Human Significance of the Skin, Ashley Montagu \noffers many \npearls of wisdom, such as: \"To shut off any one of the senses is \nto reduce the dimensions of our reality, and to the extent that that occurs we \nlose touch with It; we become imprisoned in a world of impersonal words, \nsans touch, sans taste, sans flavor. The one-dimensionality of the word \nbecomes a substitute for the richness of the multi-dimensionality of the \nsenses, and \nour world grows crass, \nflat, and arid in \nconsequence.\" \nSadly, he's right. People end up ignoring most of what they feel, and as they \nget less and less in touch \nwith themselves, they become more and more \nhectic, filling their days with \nfrantic activity rather than just enjoying the \nsensation-filled miracle of being alive. Instead of hectic, I think people \nshould become \nmore haptic. A haptic person is especially in tune with her \nsense of \ntouch, or, as Ashley \nMontagu would say, has a \n\"mentally extended \nsense of touch \nwhich \ncomes about through the \ntotal \nexperience of \nliving and \nacting In space.\" \nHaptic comes \nfrom \nthe Greek \nword, \nhaptesthai, to \ntouch. \nTo \nstart \nyourself in a \nhaptic \ndirection, you need to know a \nfew \ndetails \nabout the skin: \nI\n,fro You \nhave more than 3 million cells in a patch of skin about \nthe size of a \nbottle cap. \nroo \nYour skin contains 2 to 5 million \nsweat glands and about 2

Reach out and touch one object at a \ntime, picking it up and using your \nfingertips to try to determine what it is. \nIf your partner has been creative in \nchoosing the objects, you should \nhave an interesting \nexperience. Use just your \nfingertips for this exercise \nand resist the temptation to \nget your nose or other senses \ninvolved in \nthe \nprocess. \n4. Override your mind's tendency to \nidentify the object and then create \na visual \npicture of it, categorize it, and \ndismiss it. \nYour mind goes into its \nautomatic pattern the moment you realize \nwhat \nthe object is. Instead of giving in to that \ntendency, continue to explore \nthe object, \ndiscovering properties you overlooked before. If you \ncan't \nguess what the object \"really\" is, that's \nokay. In fact, that's good. Just \ncontinue to feel \nit. When your mind can't categorize \nsomething, you're \nforced to perceive It in a \nnew way. \n5. Based on your present tactile \nencounter alone, rename the objects. \nA \ngolf ball, for example, may \nbecome a dimple-nut. Have your \npartner \nwrite \nthe new \nnames down on pieces of paper and place \nthem next to \nthe \nobjects. \nEFTA00008084\n\n Chapter 3: Your \nSkin: Frontier to the Rest of \nthe World 39 \nLittle skin, lotta \nfeeling \nDo you know why little \ntots seem so extraordi-\nnarily sensitive when it comes to touch? \nChildren up to three years old have a total of 80 \nspecialized sensory receptors called Meissner's \ncorpuscles per \nsquare millimeter of skin, as \nopposed to 20 M a young adult, and \n4 in old age \n(Montagu, p. 7). That's \nwhy babies are so over-\nwhelmed by tickles and touches. \nThey feel more \nthan we do. \n6. Remove the \nblindfold and check out your work. \nJust being blindfolded greatly alters your perception of the \nobjects. \nUnable to \ntake them for granted, labeling one a \"golf \nball\" and another a \"yellow stick-\non note,\" you will \nquite likely discover something about your ability to \nfeel, \nand in the process Increase your touch-ability \n(see Chapter 5 for more on \ntouch\n-ability). \nLayering It \nOn \nYour skin, like every other part of your body, is \na living, growing, changing \nthing. In fact, you have an entirely \nnew \nouter layer of skin \nevery \n27 \ndays, \nwhich means you're an awful lot like \nsnakes, lizards, and other animals who \nleave their skins \nbehind periodically. You Just shed your \nskin one skin cell at \na time, so it's not so obvious. \nThe epidermis, \nthe outer \nportion of your skin that keeps \nreplenishing itself \nand flaking off, is made up \nof several layers. The bottommost layer \nkeeps \nreproducing \nnew \nskin cells, which are then \npushed \ntoward \nthe \nupper layers, \ncollectively known as \nthe horny \nzone. It is \ncalled the horny \nzone \nbecause the \ncells there are hardened, like horns. \nSo, what you're really seeing when you look at somebody's \nskin is a whole \nbunch of dead, hardened cells that are about to fall off. In \nfact, \nexfoliation, a \nparticular \ntype of spa treatment that I explain further in \nChapter 15, assists \nthe skin in this process. \nKeep in mind that \ncertain skin \nconditions \nmake \nperforming a \nmassage Inad-\nvisable \n(see Chapter 10). For now, I'm \ntalking about basic, healthy skin in an \naverage \nperson. \nEFTA00008085\n\n40\n Part I: \nDiscovering Massage \nfor Greater \nHealth and Happiness  \nThe hazards \nof breathing \nThe \"dust\" \nparticles that you see \nfloating in a \nshaft of sunlight are \nmostly dead skin \ncells from \nthe \nepidermis that have recently \nbeen shed by \nyou \nand any other \npeople who have \ninhabited \nthe room. \nAs you breathe, \nyou can't help but \ninhale some of \nthese flaky cells, thus \nsucking \ncousin \nBob, Aunt Julia, \nthe refrigerator \nrepair \nman, and \neven your own self \ninto your lungs. \nThis situation \npresents no biological hazard \nand \nis usually not a cause for \nconcern because most \npeople don't \nknow about it and \ntherefore don't \nget \ngrossed out. \nWhoops. \nBeneath \nthe epidermis lies the \ndermis, which is \nfilled with fat cells, \nblood and \nlymph vessels, \noil glands, sweat \nglands, nerve endings, \nand hair follicles. The \ndermis also helps to bind \nthe outer layers of the \nskin to the subcutaneous \n(which means \n\"beneath the \nskin') tissues below.

Your skin is \nequally capable of allowing \nthese terrorists to \ncross \nthe border, which means you \nshould stay on guard regarding the prod-\nucts \nyou come into \ncontact with. \nExcretion and secretion \nYour skin can also get rid \nof toxic elements, like exiling unwanted characters \nfrom the country. This process is called \nexcretion, and it's handled by those \nruffians, the sweat \nglands. You have several \nmillion of these glands, and they \neliminate waste products \nvia perspiration. \nIn addition to excreting, your skin \nsecretes as well, issuing forth an oily \nsub-\nstance called sebum \nthat coats the skin and \nhelps preserve moisture. \nSecretion is a good thing, \nbecause the skin Is about 50 — 70 percent \nmoisture, \nand \nyou don't want it to dry out. \nHeat regulation \nYour skin is constantly monitoring \nthe temperature in the environment \nand \nhelping to maintain \nyour body's internal temperature \nat an even 98.61E (37°C) \nthrough adjustments of blood \nvessels and sweat glands, which dilate \nor con-\ntract in \nresponse to heat and cold. \nIf you don't touch me, \nI'll die \nTouch is literally a matter of life \nand death. The \nphilosopher \nBertrand Russell noted the impor-\ntance of touch, saying, \n\"Not only our geometry \nand \nour physics, but our whole conception of \nwhat exists outside us, is based on the sense of \ntouch? For this reason, it's urgently important \nthat infants and small \nchildren receive an abun-\ndant supply of human contact. \nIn the early 1900s, Dr. Henry Dwight Chapin \nreported \nthat when orphaned \nbabies were rou-\ntinely put in \nhomes and left to wither away with \nessentially zero human contact, a startling 99 \npercent of them \ndied within one year of.admis-\nsion (Juhan p.43). \nThose who survived suffered \nsigns of retardation and maladjustment. \nTo say that the world would truly be a  better \nplace if  more people received massage—\nespecially \nas \npart of their \ndevelopmental \nyears — is not an \nexaggeration. Touch is a vital \npart of human growth, for individuals and for the \nentire \ncommunity. \nEFTA00008088\n\n Chapter 3: Your Skin: Frontier to the \nRest of the World 43 \nRespiration \nOxygen comes in through the pores of the skin, and carbon dioxide goes out, \njust like in \nthe lungs, but on a smaller scale. If \nyou're a James Bond fan and \nsaw the classic movie, Gold Finger, you may \nremember the famous opening \nscene, which featured a woman painted completely gold and then left on a \nhotel room bed in Miami \nBeach. In the movie, she died because her skin \ncouldn't \"breathe,\" and a similar fate could happen to you in real life \nif all of \nyour pores were suddenly blocked. \nSensation \nIf skin were basically Just nature's way of keeping what's inside \nof our bodies \nin and what's outside out, life wouldn't be nearly as much fun as it is, and, as \nit turns out, those guards at \nthe border have a sensitive side beneath their \nhats after all. \nProviding you \nwith a rich, complex variety of sensations is by far the most \npersonally \ngratifying of the skin's functions, which is something \nyou'll \ndevelop an even greater appreciation for as you practice the \ntechniques in \nthe other chapters of this book. \nTouching \nthe Skin through Massage \nRecently, even the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) has become con-\nvinced that massage offers undeniable results. My co-author, Michel \nVan \nWelden, has \nworked with the FDA extensively and has substantiated \nsome \nclaims for the effectiveness of massage. \nFollowing are some of his findings: \ntoe Scientific evidence points to the fact that massage \ncan positively impact \nskin \ntone. \nsof \nPigs love \nmassage. \n's true. In a series of experiments at \nVanderbilt University and UCLA, Michel \nworked \nwith a team of ace physicians \nadministering a series of massage \nexperiments on some \nvery special subjects: Flopsy, \nZeus, \nand \nPeewee, three \nYorkshire pigs. \nThe three pigs were chosen for their high moral \ncharacter and love of luxuri-\nous spa treatments. No, actually they were chosen because pigs (even though \nyou may not like to admit it) have remarkably \nsimilar skin to humans.

The FDA eventually \napproved this device as an effective way to tone the skin and improve the \nappearance of cellulite. Here are some of the findings of these experiments, \nas reported in Newsweek magazine, November 1998: \n3 This type of Massage, called Endermologie', stimulates fibroblasts, \nwhich \nproduce collagen. \n3 \nAn increase in collagen fibers can improve the elasticity and youthful \nappearance of the skin. \nMichel should know. He's been a physical therapist in France for almost 30 \nyears, and in that country the physical therapists do an awful lot of massage. \nIn fact, each of the 35,000 practicing physical therapists in that country gives \nan average of 4,374 massages a year, most of them paid for by \nnational insur-\nance. Perhaps that's why the French have a saying, bien dans son peau, for \nsomeone who is happy and content; the phrase means \"good in his skin.\" \nEFTA00008090\n\nChapter 4 \nI've Got You Under My \nSkin: \nThe \nBasics of \nWhat's \nInside \nIn This \nChapter \n> Discovering your three-dimensional body \nGetting a feel for muscles \nand bones \nj> Exploring \nthe organ systems \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 OOOOOOO 0 \nOOOOOOOOOOOOO 0 0 0 OOOOOOO \nM\nost people would prefer to leave the interior of the human body a mys-\ntery, like the ingredients in a \nHostess Twinkie. You're better off just \nenjoying the thing, they figure, and not \nasking too many questions. This atti-\ntude works fine for most applications in life, such as walking around, going to \nthe movies, eating pizza, and so forth, but once you decide to \nmassage some-\nbody, you'll benefit by knowing a little \nabout human anatomy. \nHere's why: \n3 \nYou become aware of \ncertain areas that are delicate or sensitive and \nshould \ntherefore be avoided (see Chapter \n10 for more information on \nthis \nissue). . \n3 \nYou develop an \nidea of what's going on internally when someone com-\nplains about specific aches and pains. \n3 You discover how certain strokes on the surface are acting on deeper \nstructures, such as the circulatory \nsystem, the lymph system, and more. \n3 You come to understand how your touch is affecting the body as a \nwhole. \nThe purpose of \nthis chapter is to give you a very basic understanding of how \nyour touch is felt, not Just on the surface of the body, but into its depths as \nwell. \nEFTA00008091\n\n46\n \nPart I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health and \nHappiness  \nMichelangelo's inner vision \nHave you ever been to Florence and visited the \nGalleria della Accademia where Michelangelo's \nfamous \nstatue of David stands? Well, let me tell \nyou, it's worth it. You \nenter and walk down a long \ncorridor filled with half-finished sculptures \nbefore you come to the high \nglass-domed cham-\nber where. David \nawaits. The power oldie piece \nis not just 'nits mass and detail, but alsain its \nfullness. David \nseems to  be filled to-diet:1m \nwith life, as,if he's about to burst out of his skin \nat any moment \nHow did Michelangelo \nknow exactly howeach \nof the muscles and bones were arranged inside \nthe human body in order to \nrecreate such real-\nity? Did he study \nanatomy at the medical school \nof Florence? Did he look it up in books? \nThe fact is  that studying anatomy the time-\nhonored way (using cadavers) was illegal \nduring Michelangelo's \nlifetime, outlawed bythe \nCatholic Church as sacrilegious. Undaunted, the \nartist found a sympathetic priest who gave him \na  key to one of the city's morgues where \nMichelangelo would break in at nightto perform \nillicit autopsies. Even though he had to risk his \nown life to do it, exploring the interior of the \nhuman body proved:invaluable to \nthe creation \nof his \nart. \nTo give a massagethat feels like a work of art, \nyou'll want know what's inside the human body, \ntoo. And these days, nobody's going to arrest \nyou for wanting to find out \nWow, That's Deep \nPerhaps \nthe most fundamental misconception \npeople have as they first set \nout to massage somebody Is that the human body \nIs a two-dimensional \nobject rather than a \nthree-dimensional object. How Is that possible, you say? \nEveryone knows we're not \nflat. Right? \nWell, that's true, but everyone \nknows that a lake is three-dimensional, too, \nhaving depth as well as \nwidth and breadth, right? What \ndo you picture In \nyour \nmind when you think of a lake, \nthough? If you're like most people, \nyou \nthink of the surface of the lake, the visible area of water surrounded on all \nsides by the \nshore. \nAnd in a \nsimilar way, even though you know there's \ndepth inside you, too, \ncontaining all the unfathomable \nmysteries of tissue and bone, you may still \nhabitually concern yourself \nwith the surface, because that \nis what you see. \nThe problem with this \ntwo-dimensional way of thinking is obvious \nif \nyou \ncon-\nsider what \nwould happen were you to attempt to \nwalk out to the middle of the \nlake. Quite quickly, you'd \nunderstand about the lake's three\n-dimensionality. \nThe same \napplies when you wade out onto the \nseemingly two-dimensional \nsurface of a person's body as \nyou give her a massage. The mysterious \nliquid \ndepths beneath the \nskin suddenly surge up around \nyour fingers, and If you \ndon't know how to swim, you'll drown. \nOr at the very least, you'll look silly \ndoing the dog paddle as you head desperately back to shore. \nEFTA00008092\n\nChapter \n4: \nI've \nGot \nYou \nUnder \nMy \nSkin: \nThe \nBasics \nof \nWhat's \nInside \n47 \nYou \ncan \ngive \na \nnice, \npleasant \nrubdown \nwithout \nknowing \na \nthing \nabout \nwhat \nyou're \ndoing: \nThe \nmere \ntactile \nstimulation \nof \nskin\n-to\n-skin \nhas \npositive \nthera-\npeutic \neffects; \nbut \nto \ngive \na \ngood \nmassage, \none \nthat \nmakes \npeople \nsay \n\"wow, \nthat \nwas \nincredible,\" \nyou \nhave \nto \nlearn \nhow \nto \nswim. \nProof \nThat \nyou're \nThree \nDimensional \nHere's \na \nway \nto \nprove \nscientifically \nthat \nyou \nare \nindeed \na \nthree-dimensional \nbeing \nand \nthat \nall \nkinds \nof \nsecrets \nexist \nbelow \nthe \nsurface \nof \nyour \nskin. \nYou \nonly \nneed \ntwo \nthings \nto \ndo \nthis \nexperiment: \nyour \nhand \nand \na \nflat \nsurface \nsuch \nas \na \ntable \nor \ndesk. \nFirst, \nturn \nyour \nhand \npalm\n-downward \nand \nhold \nit \nover \nthe \ntable \na \nfew \ninches \nhigh. \nThen \nreach \ndown \nwith \njust \nyour \nfingertips \nto \ntouch \nthe \nsurface. \nAnd \nfinally \nbend \nyour \nmiddle \nfinger \nand \nfold \nit \nunder \nyour \nhand \nuntil \nthe \nfirst \ntwo \nknuckles \nare \nfl\nat \non \nthe \ntable. \nGood. \nWhat \nI'd \nlike \nyou \nto \ndo \nnow \nis \nlift \nyour \nother \nfingers \nup \nand \naway \nfrom \nthe \ntable \ntop \none \nat \na \ntime \nwhile \nleaving \nyour \nmiddle \nfinger \nfirmly \nplanted. \nGo \nahead \nand \ndo \nthis \nright \nalong \nwith \nme \nas \nyou're \nreading \nIf \nyou'd \nlike. \nFirst \ntry \nthe \nthumb; \nit \nlifts \ndownright \neasily, \ndoesn't \nit? \nWay \nup \nhigh. \nNext \ntry \nthe \nindex \nfinger; \nnot \nquite \nas \nimpressive \nas \nthe \nthumb \nbut \nstill \ndefinitely \noff \nthe \ntable. \nTry \nthe \npinkie \nfinger; \nyou \nsee \nhow \nit \nlifts \nup \nabout \nthe \nsame \nor \nhigher \nthan \nthe \nindex \nfinger? \nAnd \nlastly, \ntry \nthe \nring \nfinger. \nGo \nahead. \nI'll \nwait. \nWhat's \nwrong? \nCome \nonl \nLift \nit \nup \nalready. \nCan't \ndo \nit? \nWhy \ncan't \nyou \nlift \nyour \nring \nfinger? \nYou \nmay \nhave \ntried \nthis \nexperiment \nbefore, \nbut \ndid \nyou \never \nfigure \nout \nwhat's \ngoing \non? \nSomebody \nshowed \nit \nto \nme \nwhen \nI \nwas \nin \nhigh \nschool, \nbut \nit \nwasn't \nuntil \nI \nwas \nstudying \nanatomy \nas \npart \nof \nmassage \ntraining \nthat \nI \nunderstood \nwhat's \nhappening. \nThe \nsecret \nis \nthis: \nBuried \nwithin \nthe \ndepths \nof \nyour \nforearm \nare \nthree \ntiny \nlittle \nmuscles, \none \nthat \nlifts \nyour \nindex \nfinger, \none \nthat \nlifts \nyour \npinkie \nfinger, \nand \none \nthat \nlifts \nyour \nthumb. \nBut \nyou \nhave \njust \none \nmuscle \nthat \nlifts \nboth \nthe \nring \nfinger \nand \nmiddle \nfinger, \nand \nso \nwhen \none \nof \nthem \nis \nheld \ndown, \nthe \nother \none \ncan't \nlift \nup. \nGo \nahead, \ntry \nit \nwith \nthe \nring \nfinger \non \nthe \ntable \ninstead \nof \nthe \nmiddle \nfinger. \nSame \nresult, \nright? \nThis \nexample \nis \nJust \nto \nshow \nthe \neffects \nof \nyour \nthree-dimensional \ndepths \non \nyour \ntwo-dimensional \nsurface. \nIt's \nimportant \nto \nremember \nthis \nwhen \nyou're \ngetting \nready \nto \nmassage \nsomeone, \nand \nI'll \nremind \nyou \nto \n\"think \n3-D\" \nwhen \nyou \nread \nthe \nchapters \nin \nPart \nM. \nEFTA00008093\n\n45\n Part I: \nDiscovering Massage for Greater \nHealth and Happiness  \nFigure 4-1: \nTiny mus-\ncles \ndeep \nin \nyour \nforearm \ndetermine \nthe possible \nmovements \nof your \nhand. \nLearning► to Feet \nFor a \nmoment, imagine you have a bas-relief map \nof the world before you In \nwhich all the landmarks are \nraised from the surface.

You can \nget \nvery sensitive fingers by \npracticing \nthis, and in \nthe \nnext section, I lead \nyou through an exercise to help you \nstart that sensitiza-\ntion \nprocess. \nEFTA00008094\n\nChapter \n4: \nI've \nGot \nYou \nUnder \nMy \nSkin: \nThe \nBasics \nof \nWhat's \nInside \nGetting \na \nfeeling \nfor \npalpation \nTry \nthis \nexercise \nto \nbegin \nsensitizing \nyour \nfingers \nto \nthe \nvarious \ntextures, \nshapes, \nand \nlandmarks \nyou \nwill \nfind \nbeneath \nthe \nskin. \nI. \nSitting \nin \na \nchair, \nwith \nyour \nback \nstraight, \nturn \nyour \nhead \nto \nthe \nright, \nas \nif \nyou \nwere \ntrying \nto \nlook \nback \nover \nyour \nright \nshoulder. \n2. \nNow, \nreach \nup \nwith \nyour \nright \nhand \nand, \nusing \njust \nthe \nfi\nngertips, \nfeel \ngently \nalong \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \nneck \nuntil \nyou \nlocate \nthe \nlong \nband \nof \nvertical \nmuscle \nstretching \nfrom \nyour \ncollar \nbone \nup \nto \nthe \nside \nof \nyour \nhead, \ncalled \nthe \nsternocleidomastoid \nmuscle, \nwhich \nis \nillustrated \nin \nFigure \n4-2. \n3. \n\"Walk\" \nyour \nfingertips \nup \nand \ndown \nthis \nmuscle, \nfeeling \nfor \nwhere \nit \nconnects \nnear \nthe \ncenter \nof \nyour \ncollar \nbone \n(the \norigin) \nand \nup \nalong \nthe \nbase \nof \nyour \nskull \n(the \ninsertion). \nDo \ncertain \nparts \nfeel \ntighter \nthan \nothers? \nIs \npart \nof \nthe \nmuscle \nthinner \nthan \nothers? \n4. \nGrasp \nthe \nmuscle \nbetween \nyour \nfingertips, \nas \nif \nit \nwere \na \nguitar \nstring \nand \nyou \nwere \ngoing \nto \npluck \nit. \nBe \ncareful \nnot \nto \ndig \nyour \nfingers \ninto \nthe \nsensitive \nfront \npart \nof \nyour \nneck. \n5. \nStill \ngrasping \nthe \nmuscle, \nslowly \nbring \nyour \nhead \nback \nto \ncenter, \nfeel-\ning \nthe \nsoftening \nin \nthe \nmuscle \nbetween \nyour \nfingers \nas \nyou \ndo \nso. \nRepeat \nthe \nprocess \nseveral \ntimes, \nback \nand \nforth. \n6. \nWalk \nyour \nfingers \ndown \nto \nthe \nbase \nof \nthis \nmuscle \nand \nthen \nonto \nthe \ncollar \nbone, \nfollowing \nit \nalong \nout \ntoward \nthe \nshoulder. \nHow \ndoes \nthe \nbone \nfeel \ndifferent \nthan \nthe \nmuscle? \nIn \nwhat \nways \nis \nit \nthe \nsame? \n7. \nNow \nwalk \nyour \nfi\nngers \naway \nfrom \nthe \ncollar \nbone \nup \nover \ntoward \nyour \nback \nuntil \nyou \nreach \nthe \ntop \nof \nyour \nshoulder. \nUse \na \nlittle \nfirmer \npressure \nto \nfeel \nalong \nthe \nlength \nof \nthis \nmuscle. \nWhere \ndoes \nit \nfeel \nharder? \nWhere \ndoes \nit \nfeel \nsofter? \nAre \nthere \nany \n\"knots\" \nor \n\"bands\" \nof \nharder \ntissue \nwithin \nthe \nmore \npliable \nsurrounding \narea? \nNotice \nwhether \nthere \nare \nany \npoints \nthat \nfeel \nmore \ntender \nwhen \nyou \ntouch \nthem, \nand \nwhether \nthese \ntender \npoints \ncorrespond \nto \nthe \n\"knots\". \n49 \nEFTA00008095\n\n50\n   Part I: \nDiscovering Massage for \nGreater Health and \nHappiness  \nFigure 4-t \nTurning your \nhead to \none side \nexposes \nyour stem-\nocleidomas-\ntold \nmuscle, \nwhich is \nthen easy \nto palpate. \nTake several minutes \nto do this.

Therefore, \nI'm not \ngoing to bore \nyou or her by loading \nyou down with all \nkinds of Latinate \nwords \nand \nphrases. Instead, I'm \ngoing to do \nsomething fun, in plain \nEnglish, that's \ngoing to help give \nyou an idea where \nthings are \nlocated anatomically. \nEFTA00008096\n\nChapter 4: I've \nGot You Under My Skin: The \nBasics of What's Inside 51 \nYour \nmedial malleolus, or inner ankle bone, Is \none of at least forty seven \n\"bony landmarks\" \nthroughout your body. Now, before you go making any \ncrude comments about bony landmarks, \nlet me assure you that this is indeed \nwhat they are called by \nprofessionals everywhere. They have \ncompelling \nnames, such \nas xiphoid process, occipital \nprotuberance, and greater tuberosity \nof the humerus. I'm going to use laymen's \nterms, though, and expose you to a \nfew of \nthese \nlandmarks as part of \na game. \nThat's \nright, \nIt's time \nto play .... \nThe bony \nlandmark game \nIt can really be a lot of fun \ngetting to know what's where beneath \nyour skin, \nand, in \nfact, for many centuries (before the \ninvention of TV) people the world \nover would sit around the \ncampfire playing the bony landmark \ngame. This \nwas a great \nway to pass the time between wolverine \nattacks, and It's an effec-\ntive \nmethod to teach \nanatomy to the young at the \nsame time. \nThe game is simple: I describe a particular \nlandmark (see FI\ngure \n4-3) for you \nIn terms that \nyoti can understand and give you \ndirections on how to locate it \nthrough palpation. Then, all you have to do \nis \nsupply me with \nthe common, \neveryday term we use to describe this landmark. It's important that you actu-\nally do the palpation, not just read \nthe words, because that is what will \nfamiliarize \nyou with the terrain you massage In future \nchapters. \nReady? \n1.  You \ncan find this landmark by holding one \nhand out in front of you, with \nyour \npalm \nfacing you. Feeling \nwith the \nfingertips of your other \nhand, \nnotice \nthat you have two bones in the \nforearm, one on the pinkie finger \nside (the ulna), and one on \nthe thumb side (the radius). \nFollow the bone \non the \npinkie finger side all the way from \nyour wrist to its extreme other \nend. \nYou'll find \na bump \nthere, \ncalled the \nolecranon process, \notherwise \nknown as the \n2. Cross one of \nyour feet up and rest it on the \nother knee so you can exam-\nine it. Then feel with both \nhands along the shin bone \n(tibia) in the front \nof \nyour lower leg. Follow it down all the \nway to your foot and see what \nhappens to it. Feel how it \ncurves back toward you and ends up in \na \nbump at the top of \nyour foot? This is the medial \nmalleolus or \n3. Trace your fingers down onto \nyour foot and then back In the \nopposite \ndirection \nfrom your toes onto thecalcaneus, or  \nbone. \n4. Now sit \nup straight. Reach down along one side of your \nbody until your \nhand almost slips underneath you. \nRight at that point you should feel a \nbone called the \ngreater trochanter of the \nfemur, which \nis \notherwise known \nas the bony \nknob at the top of the longest \nbone in the body, the \n bone. \nEFTA00008097\n\n52\n \nPart I: Discovering Massage for \nGreater Health and \nHappiness  \nFigure 4-3: \n\"Bony \nland-\nmarks\" are \nspecific \nareas on the \nskeleton \nthat you \ncan feel \nfrom \nabove \nthe skin. \n5. Walk \nyour fingers back up \nalong the side of your \nbody about 6 — 8 inches \nuntil you hit the \nnext bony landmark. \nIt should be a sharp \nridge that \nsticks \nout and that you can \nfollow along toward the \nfront of your body \nfor a few inches. \nThis is the iliac crest, \nalso known as the \nbone. \n6. Reaching your \nhands up to your face, \nlocate your chin and then \nfeel \nback along the lower \nridge toward your ear. It \ncurves up here, forming \nthe \nramus of the mandible, \notherwise known as the \npoint at the angle of \nthe \nbone. \nEFTA00008098\n\nChapter 4: I've Got You Under My Skin: The \nBasics of What's Inside \n7. You'll need a partner for this one. Have her lie face-down on a comfort-\nable surface with her back \nexposed, and then gently lift her arm, bend it \nat \nthe elbow, and place her hand on her lower back. \nLet her upper arm \nrest down along her side. You'll \nnotice that by doing this you cause a big \nbump to \nappear on her upper back. Feel along the edges of this triangular-\nshaped bone, otherwise known as the \nAnswers: 1. elbow, 2. Inner ankle bone, 3. heel, 4. thigh, 5. hip, 6. jaw, 7. shoul-\nder \nblade. \nThese are just a few of the many \nlandmarks you can palpate, and this game is \nmeant to get you comfortable with the fact that you can actually feel \nand \naffect the \nstructures of anatomy without being a scientist or doctor. When \nyou practice hands-on massage, \nremember this and use your knowledge to \nguide you through your partner's body. \nSett \ntissues \nNow that you know how to familiarize yourself with bony landmarks, you're \nprobably wondering about all the other parts of your \nbody that are not bony \nlandmarks. After all, you're not going to be massaging bones. It's the soft \ntissue that you'll have In your hands most \nof the time, and by soft tissue I \ndon't mean Kleenex brand facial tissues. I mean muscles, mostly, and a \nlittle \nbit of connective tissue as \nwell. \nVINI0\n+  \nMuscles \ncomprise 40 to 60 percent of your total body weight, depending \nupon your gender and physical \ncondition, and you have over 600 of them, \nlarge and \nsmall. Each one is compartmentalized in a sheath of fascia, \nwhich \nsets it apart and helps it function as \na distinct unit, although the truth is that \nyou never use just one muscle to perform any given action. As Mark Beck \nsays in Theory and Practice of \nTherapeutic Massage, \"Muscles have anatomic \nindividuality, but they do not have functional \nindividuality.\" They are always \nworking in \ngroups to create movement. That's their whole purpose \nfor being. \nThe larger \nobvious muscles you can see simply through \nobserving a body In \nmotion are called \nskeletal muscles. There are also two other types of muscle \ntissue: cardiac and smooth. Cardiac, as the name implies, Is the special \nmuscle tissue that makes up the heart. \nSmootlrmuscle lines the stomach, \nintestines, and blood \nvessels. \nThe slightest movement of the most mundane part of your \nanatomy (your \nleft knee, for \nexample) requires the precisely timed and perfectly executed \nsynchronization of many muscles, and there's \nabsolutely no way that you \ncould consciously \ncoordinate all that without going nuts. Imagine Michael \nJordan driving in for a lay-up and having to fire off messages to every single \none of his separate muscles to do so. It would look \nsomething like this: \n3 \nEFTA00008099\n\n54\n \nPart I: \nDiscovering Massage for \nGreater Health and \nHappiness  \n\"Okay, contract the quadriceps, especially the rectus femoris, and simultane-\nously pull in the \npsoas, push off the soleus, shorten the gastrocnemius, and \nextend the \nweb of flexors and the tibialis anterior. Now compensate for the \nlifted foot by tightening the opposite gluteus maximus and bracing all the \nmuscles \nin the lower back, too numerable to mention here. Whoops, that \nthrew me off, and ... whoa!\" \nAnd down he'd go, \nbefore even moving one step. In \nfact, It's much more com-\nplex than \nthat for even the simplest of \nmaneuvers, and we'd all be \nhelpless to \ntry and stand up, sit \ndown, or walk to the refrigerator if we had \nto think about it. \nSo how do we do it? \nBasically, we learn to move one \nlittle piece at a time as \nwe \ndevelop during infancy and \nchildhood, laying each chunk of the \npattern \ndown in a movement-memory \ngroove, and then building upon \nit with the next \nmovement. That's why you see babies \nexperimenting with things like kicking \ntheir legs out, bobbing \ntheir heads around, and \nbringing small electrical \nappliances toward their mouths for \nexamination. Every time they \ndo some \nthing successfully \nand then master it through \nrepetition, they file it away, and \nthat's one \nless thing they have to \nconsciously think about next time. \nOf \ncourse, this is the same \nprocedure that athletes use \nlater in life through their \npractice as they \ngradually layer all the perfect \nlittle movements they need \none upon \nthe next until they no longer \nhave to think about it but \nrather, \"Just \ndo it.\" \nBy all of this explanation, I \nmean to say that muscles \ndon't just flex and con-\ntract — they learn. \nWhat you're holding in your \nhands when you massage \nsomeone is conscious matter. In \nfact, It's your muscles \nthat tell you where \nyou are in space \nand time, through special nerve \nendings embedded in your \nmuscles \nknown as \nproprioceptors. \nI don't \nwant to freak you out with \nbizarre \nsounding anatomical \nterms, but there are two of \nthese proprioceptors that \nare particularly \ninteresting and important, \nand I want to share them \nwith you. \n3 Golgi tendon organs \nare nerve endings found, \nstrangely enough, in \nyour \ntendons. They measure how far \nany particular tendon has \nstretched, \nhow much pressure \nit's putting on the nearby bone, \nand if the tendon's \nin \ndanger of snapping. It's through \nthese little organs that you \nare saved \nfrom ripping yourself to \nshreds and pulling all \nyour muscles and \ntendons \nright \noff the \nbone. \n3 \nMuscle spindle \ncells are found in the \ncenter of muscles, what's \nknown as \nthe \n\"belly,\" where they perform \nthe important task of \nconstantly commu-\nnicating the \nstate of the muscle's \ncontraction and movement back to the \ncentral \nnervous system. They \nare basically scouts \non the outpost of \nyour active physical \nself. Without them, you \nwouldn't be able to tell \nwhere you \nwere going, how fast, \nor if you were going at \nall. \nEFTA00008100\n\nChapter 4: I've Got You Under My \nSkin: The Basics of What's Inside 55 \nCartilage, \nligaments, and tendons \nMany people find themselves confusedly refer-\nring to various connective tissue structures \nbetween the muscles and bones as \"tendons\" \nor \n'ligaments\" or \"cartilage\" without really \nknowing what \nthe heck they're talking about. \nNow, I knowyou're not one of those people, but \njust in case you have a \nfriend who's guilty of \nsuch anatomical faux pas, here's the skinny to \nset you straight \nV Cartilage gives shape to external features \nlike the nose and ears, and it is also found \nbetween bones as \na  cushion at the joints. \n(Vertebral discs are made \nfrom cartilage, for \nexample.) \n3 Ligaments connect bone to bones. \ntor Tendons connect muscle to bone. \nMuscle tissue itself is largely insensate, meaning if someone were to cut, jab, \nor even burn you directly on an exposed muscle, you \nquite likely wouldn't \nfeel much at all. \nYour muscles don't so much feel massage as they \nexperience \nmassage as it retrains \nthem how to be more relaxed in stillness, and fluid in \nmovement. \nMuscles learn, and massage teaches. \nName that muscle \nWhat often intimidates people when they're \nfirst learning massage is the \nanonymity and invisibility of muscles. Skin is plainly visible: You can clearly \nwatch your own hands make contact with somebody \nelse's body, skin to skin. \nBut muscles? How \ncan you really tell what muscle you're \ntouching when that \nmuscle is covered by \nthe skin? And besides, the muscles are all jumbled \ntogether and not that clearly defined, except in professional \nbody builders, \nwhose muscles are so \nhard and tight that they're almost \nimpossible to mas-\nsage \nanyway. So how are you expected to really \nknow what the heck you're \ntouching when you're touching a body? \nGlad you asked. This brings us \ndirectly to our next little exercise: Name \nThat \nMuscle. This game is a bit tougher because you need \nto know the names of \nthe muscles, which you might have forgotten if you weren't paying close \nattention in high school anatomy class. So, to be fair, I'm \ngoing to give you \nthe answers first. \nCan't complain about that, right? All you have to do is \nmatch the right muscle in Figure 4-4 to its \ndescription and action. If you're \nnot sure about one, see whether you can use common sense and deductive \nreasoning to figure out which the best choice might be. It will help if you \nactually perform the action described in the \nquestions so that you FEEL the \nmuscles you're looking for.

It's just a way for you to become \nfamiliar with locating muscles. I refer you to several of these landmarks, bony \nand otherwise, when you move through the how-to massage chapters in Part III. \nOther Body Systems \nDon't get the idea that it's just the skin, muscles, and bones that count when \nit comes time to massage somebody. You also \ndeal with a few other anatomi-\ncal systems that are strongly affected by your touch as well. \nThese include \nthe... \n3 Circulatory system \n3 Nervous system \n3 Endocrine system \n3 Digestive system \n3 Respiratory \nsystem \nThe next few sections \ntake a brief look at these systems and discuss how \nthey're important \nwhen you give or receive a massage. \nCireutettery system \nThe heart is constantly pumping \nyour blood (about 11 pints of it in a 160-\npound adult) \nout through your arteries and into each and every tiny little cell \nof \nyour body, carrying the nutrients and \noxygen that make it possible for you \nto stay alive. Then the \nblood travels back to your heart \nthrough the veins. On \nthis \nreturn trip, the blood has to pass through a series \nof one-way valves that \nkeep \nit from accidentally heading back in the wrong direction. \nEFTA00008104\n\nChapter 4: \nI've Got You Under My Skin: The \nBasics of What's Inside 59 \nMassage strokes have a direct effect on the flow of \nblood in the veins, so keep \nIn mind that when you massage \nsomeone, your strokes should always be in \nthe direction of venous \nflow. You wouldn't want to \naccidentally push the \nblood back \nthrough these valves and therefore \nweaken them. When a number \nof the valves weaken and \nstop working efficiently, blood can pool up \nvisibly \nand form \nvaricose veins. \nAs much as half of all \nyour blood is in your skin at any \ngiven moment, which \naccounts for that rosy glow certain \npeople have, and also for the less healthy \nappearance of varicose veins and other problems. \nMassage works powerfully \non your circulatory \nsystem, and for this reason you should \nalways be aware \nof how your \nhands are \naffecting it. \nMassage also \naffects that other circulating fluid referred to in \nChapter 1, the \nlymph. In fact, there is an entire \nsystem of massage called manual \nlymphatic \ndrainage \nmeant to assist the movement of \nthe lymph because, as you may \nknow from Chapter 1, lymph has \nno heart of its own to pump it \nalong. \nNervous system \nAs a busy person in the \ntwenty-first century, you don't have any time to \nfiddle around reminding your heart to beat, your lungs to \nbreathe, and so on. \nLucidly, your autonomic \nnervous system takes care of all that for \nyou. This \nsystem \nis further broken down into the \nsympathetic and \nparasympathetic ner-\nvous systems. The \nsympathetic nerves prepare your body for \naction, and the \nparasympathetic nerves calm you \ndown. Massage is a great way to \nstimulate \nthe \nparasympathetic nervous system, thereby \nlowering the pulse, slowing \nbreathing, and in \ngeneral, chilling you out. \nThe largest and longest nerve in \nthe body \nis \nthe sciatic, which many \npeople \nare painfully \nfamiliar with. It runs from the \nbase of your spine down the back \nof your leg, and when \nany of its length becomes pinched or \ntrapped between \nmuscles, bones, and connective tissues, it can \ncause the condition known as \nsciatica. That's the way all \nnerves work; you don't want to \nget in their way or \npiss \nthem off. Massage can help soften the \nmuscles and other soft tissue that \nsurround nerves and \nsometimes entrap them. \nAs \nI mention earlier in this chapter, \nyou also have specialized nerves \ncalled \nproprioceptors that \ntell you where your body is in \nspace, giving you your \nsense of depth, position, and \nmovement. Without them, you'd be \ninternally \nblind, and by making you more aware of them, massage can \nhelp you \"see\" \nyourself in a new way from the inside \nout. Chapter 7 has some exercises to get \nyou in touch with your \nproprioceptors. Look for \n\"The limp arm experiment.\" \nEFTA00008105\n\n60\n \nPart I: Discovering Massage for Greater Health and \nHappiness  \nThe mind-body connection \nDid you ever wonder what the \nheck people \nwere talking about when they used the term \nmind-body connection? Is it \npart of the nervous \nsystem youveren't \ntold about in school? Did \nyou think maybe there was a  tube or special \ncable of. \nSome kind near the base of your neck \nthat \nlinked your mind and your \nbody, and that \nyou were the \nonlyone who hadn't been shown \nwhere it was? Well, don't worry; you're not \nalone. In a far-reaching \nsurvey conducted by my \nwife one day at her \nrestaurant, it was ascer-\ntained that only 2.4 percent of normal people \nunderstand what the term \nmind-body connec-\ntion really means, \nand those people are \nnew-age geeks. \nTypical incorrect responses about what the \nmind-body connectionis included the following: \n3 That \nsinking feeling you get when your \nmind realizes your body did something \nit \nshouldn't have \n3 Nerves \n3 \nThe neck \nActually, the mind-body connection is \nsimply \nawareness. It's an awareness that permeates \nway.down into \nevery cell \nof \nyour body, as \ncom-\npared tote awareness of your brainalone. It's \nthe entire.you consciously affecting every other \npartofyou. \nThis whole mind/body split problem developed \ngradually \nover many centuries and was not \nreally caused by any one \nindividual, but many \nscholars have pointed to the French philosopher \nand mathematician Rene Descartes \nas having \nhad the greatest influence. He's the one who \ncoined that famous Latin phrase, \"Cogito, ergo \nsum? which means \"I \nthink, therefore I am.\" \nThat was in 1637. Well, pretty much ever since \nthen people have been assuming that it was \nonly specific:types of electrical activityinside \ntheir \nskulls that proved they indeed existed. \nVVhat's.glossed over in the history books is that \nDescartes neverreceived a great massage from \nan expert holistically oriented \npractitioner. If he \nhad, he certainly would have \nmodified his state-\nment a bit, to something like, \"Cogito et sentio, \nergo sum? I think and I feel, therefore I am.\" \nEndocrine system \nHeard of hormones? The glands that make up the endocrine system are what \nsecrete hormones into your body. It's been shown \nthat massage stimulates \nthe release of human growth hormone (HGH), \namong others, thereby affect-\ning the \nhealthy maturation of your entire body. \nDigestive system \nYour digestive system \nis a tube approximately five times as long as you are \ntall (see \nFigure 4-5). This tube, along with \nseveral digestive organs, has the \nmagical ability to transform \nwhatever enters it into a very special \nsubstance \nknown \nas \"you.\" Massage can beneficially stimulate this \nprocess if you're \nfamiliar with the various twists and \nturns this tube follows through your \nbody, especially over \nthe large intestine. \nEFTA00008106\n\nChapter 4: \nI've Got You \nUnder My Skin: The \nBasics of \nWhat's Inside \n61 \nFigure 4-5: \nFrom input \nto \noutput, \nyour \nfood \ntravels \nabout 30 \nfeet.

You can locate it by first touching bony landmark number \n5, your right hip bone, and then walking your fingers in toward your belly \nbutton a couple of inches. Sometimes this spot makes a liquid-squishing \nnoise, especially after meals. In Part III, I discuss how to use this landmark as \na starting point for some abdominal massage techniques. \nRespiratory system \nBreathing is an extremely important activity for human beings, as can be \nattested to by the millions of people around the world who have stopped \nbreathing and suffered serious side-effects, even death. Massage is \nan excel-\nlent \nopportunity to engage in some full deep breathing, as described In \nChapter 7. This reconnects you with the source of life. It also fills your blood \nwith fresh oxygen because the first place your blood goes when it leaves your \nheart is the \nlungs. \nSurprising facts \nabout your stomach \nMott of us think of the \nstomadh as \na. large \nroundith ball in the center of our abdothens, but \nactually ifs a smallish.oval sack up anko the \nleft, tucked mostly under the ribs on the side of \nyour body by your heart Like the entireintesti-\nit't lined \nwith smooth muscle.

That's like the art of getting rained on. You \nreally don't have to try very hard; just step outside and \nget \nwet. Anyone can do it. \nIn this pan . \n4 4 \nReceiving massage? Nothin' to It. No problem. Child's play. \nRight? \nWrong. \nReceiving \nmassage is more like dancing your part in a \nvery intricate pas-de-detuc, such as the tango, which, inter-\nestingly, means \"I touch\" in Latin. Both activities, at their \nbest, are extremely \ninteractive. During the tango, if you \njust stand there and don't do anything, you're going to \nmake your partner look pretty bad. Similarly, when you \nreceive a massage, you've got to communicate with your \npartner, through both verbal and nonverbal means, in \norder to get the most out of the experience. Your partner \ntouches you, you react to that touch, your muscles \nrespond accordingly, and then your partner adjusts his \ntouch to suit the reaction, and you go back and forth like \nthis throughout the entire exchange, constantly conscious \nof each \nother's presence and movement—two dancers \ncreating one dance. \nA good massage is a two-way street, equal parts proper \ngiving and informed receiving. That's the focus of this part \nof the book, in which you'll begin as a freshman in \nMassage 101 and then graduate Just three chapters later \nwith the ability to receive a \nmassage like a real pro. I \n'mow, it's tough, but \nsomebody's gotta do it. \nAlong the \nway, you'll master the tricky intricacies of mas-\nsage \nvocabulary, discover the ten rules for \nreceiving a \nmassage, and get the scoop on all the \nmassage gizmos you \nsee for sale \neverywhere. I also cover the difference \nbetween various massage \nstyles, discuss how to enjoy the \npleasures of massage \nwithout guilt, and offer \ntechniques \nfor increasing your touch\n-ability, and lots more. \nEFTA00008110\n\nChapter 5 \nA \nMassage Road \nMap \nOOOOOOOOOOOOOO \n0000000 000 00 OOOOOO 0 \nOOOOOO 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 \nIn This Chapter \nD \nObtaining healthy pleasure \nD Examining your touch-ability \nD \nChoosing the right style of massage for you \nD Deciphering touch terminology \n00 \n0000000000000000000000000 0090000000000000009000 \nWhenyou first begin to discover massage, you'll undoubtedly \nencounter some strange new words \nand some strange new \nconcepts \nthat might confuse you at first. Have no fear! This chapter is your own per-\nsonal travel guide to help you \nnavigate the sometimes puzzling new terrain in \nthe world of massage. \nHere you'll find out how to accept \nthe pleasures of \nmassage into your life and how to \nchoose the type of massage that's right for \nyou. You'll even find an English-Massage dictionary \nat the end of the chapter \nthat will help you speak the \nlanguage of massage with other \npeople. \nHealthy \nPleasure \nTo \nparaphrase Forrest Gump, sometimes massage is like a box of \nchocolates — you never know exactly \nwhat you're gonna get, but you know \nit's gonna be good. \nHowever, if you eat the whole thing, \nyou're gonna end up \nfeeling guilty and a little bloated. \nMany people just can't seem to understand \nthat massage is anything more \nthan... \n11  1.0 \nIndulgence \n1.0' \nLuxury \nt.01 Pampering \nAnd therefore they pass when it comes to massage. Some \npeople raise their \nnoses up at its pleasures as if they were \ntoo good for it. Others shy away from \nthe experience, calling \nit expensive and extravagant, as if massage were too \ngood for them. \nEFTA00008111\n\n66\n \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nThe \nMary Poppins problem \nIn my opinion, you can trace the debilitating atti-\ntude so many people have concerning pleasure \nback to one particular perton, somebody you'd \nnever suspect \nYes, Em \ntalking about Mary \nPoppins. In \nthe filth, she waltzes around looking \nall prim and.respectable and happy in her tight-\nfitting outfit, singing, \"It takes a  spoonful of \nsugar to help the \nmeditine go down\" until even-\ntually \npeople \nend up \nbelieving her. Now, \neverybody \nthinks that anything good for him or \nher should feelhad. No pain, no gain, right? This \nphilosophy pretty \nmuch messed up an entire \nveneration. \nWhat if sugar was the medicine? \nWhat if pleasure — not the medicine — made \nthe pain goaway? \nAs one scholarput it, \"Recent research sup-\nports the view that \nthe deprivation of physical \npleasure is \na major ingredient in the expression \nof physical violence\" (Juhan p.53). People need \npleasure to be healthy, and receiving massage \nis one of the most natural, healthyways to \nexpe-\nrience pleasure without \nany negative side \neffects. \nThe following definition is inscribed on a coffee \nmug from a  massage school in New Jersey: \nMas-sage: In.lthe pleasure that relieves the \npain. That's a good way to look at it. If you think \nof massage as pleasurable medicine, you will be \nable to \naccept \nit into your life \nmore easily. \nThe underlying reason for both of these attitudes is guilt. Many people \nsimply have trouble Justifying paying for something that feels as good as mas-\nsage. They also have difficulty justifying having another human pay such \nlavish attention to them for an entire hour. \nWell, this \nguilt is truly unfortunate, and completely unnecessary, because \nmassage is actually much better for you than \nchocolate. In fact, it has all of \nthe pleasures without any of the negative \nside effects. That's right, there's not \na single thing wrong with massage. \nMassage ... \n3 Is \ncalorie free \n3 \nIs fat \nfree \n3 \nWon't \nrot your teeth \n3 Is \nimpossible to overdose on \nWell okay, massage does \nhave one catch. Make no mistake \nabout it, once you \ntaste good massage, you're going to \nwant more — lots more. Like chocolate, \nmassage can be addictive. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can \nreceive a massage every day for the \nrest of your life with absolutely no nega-\ntive side effects. \nEFTA00008112\n\n Chapter 5: A Massage Road Map \n67 \nIn \nfact, beloved entertainer, Bob Hope, has \nreceived a massage almost every \nday of his life for over fifty years. He's dragged a number of massage thera-\npists all over the globe with him while he was off \nentertaining the troops and \nmaking his movies. I  had the \nopportunity to massage him once myself. At the \ntime, he was \n87 years old, but because of all the massage he'd \nreceived over \nthe years, his skin was smooth and \nsupple, and his muscles were amazingly \nwell toned. \nOf course, you may not have \nthe time or money for a massage every day like \nBob Hope. But time or money \nisn't what's most likely to stop you in the first \nplace. It's your attitude. \nTesting pour Touch-Ability \nThe one thing about massage that you \nreally can't avoid is the fact that you \nhave to touch another human body in order to do it. This basic reality is \nwhat keeps many people from taking the first step of \neither getting or receiv-\ning a massage. \nTouch another human? Yuck! \nMost societies have quite a few touch-related taboos and complexes, things \nthat may be holding you back \nfrom experiencing massage. The following \ntouch-ability survey can help reveal \nyour own, perhaps unconscious, touch \ntaboos, and suggest ways to overcome them. After you know what problems \nyou're dealing with, you can \nproceed more easily. Be totally honest with \nyour-\nself. There are no right or wrong answers, \nonly helpful ones. \nFor each question, fill in the number that most \nclosely matches your feelings. \n3 Strongly disagree: 1 \n3 Disagree: 2 \n3 \nNeutral: 3 \n3 Agree: 4 \n3 \nStrongly agree: 5 \n1. My childhood family \nencouraged touching and hugging between \nmembers. \n2. I can offer a compassionate touch on the arm, shoulder, or back of \nsomeone I don't know, and doing \nso feels natural. \n3. When someone bumps me on the \nstreet, instead of feeling anger, my first \nreaction is to \nbrush it off as an accident. \n4. My natural Inclination is to massage \nanimals (at least ones that don't \nbite), \nscratching them behind the \nears to make them feel good. \nEFTA00008113\n\n68 \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \n5. I can touch or be touched by \nsomeone I find attractive without having \nsexual intentions or fantasies about them. \n6. I prefer to go barefoot outdoors when safe and appropriate. \n7. I \nhave, on occasion, hugged a tree or draped myself luxuriously over a \nwarm rock in the sun. \n8. I believe In heart-to-heart hugs that express my affection and openness \nto \npeople. \n9. People tell me I have \"good hands\" and ask me to rub their shoulders \nwhen they're feeling stiff or sore. \n10. In work situations, I offer encouragement and \nrecognition to others with \na heart-felt touch in combination with words of \npraise. \nTotal: \nThe higher the number you come up with, the greater likelihood that touch \nand massage are \nsomething easy for you to accept in your life. If you scored a \n50, great! Forge straight ahead into the following chapters, and enjoy. If you \nscored in the 40s, you're among the most tactile people in the world, and \nmassage is probably a part of your life already. If you scored in the 20s or 30s, \nyou're somewhere in the average regarding touch-ability, and you may want \nto stop here for a few minutes and consider trying some of the experiences \nlisted below. If you scored below twenty, you're still in the developmental \nstage of touch-ability, and you will definitely benefit by trying some or all of \nthe following suggestions. \n3 \nPick a parent, sibling, or even a cousin and give that person a hug for no \nreason. \n3 The next time an appropriate situation arises, gently place your palm on \nthe shoulder of someone you've Just met, offering compassion and soli-\ndarity for a moment. \n3 When \nsomeone bumps or jostles you, stop and take a deep breath and \nlook for the hidden cause of your anger. Usually, the anger results \nbecause you feel that you're in the \"right.\" Let go of being right and be \nforgiving \ninstead. \n3 \nSpend a full \nfiveminutes concentrating on nothing else but massaging \nthe head and ears of a dog or cat (assuming you're not allergic, \nof \ncourse). \n3 \nGet a serious, therapeutic massage \nand concentrate on the inner relax-\ning of your muscles, Just to show yourself that massage involves more \nthan sensual \npleasure. \n3 Take a walk through \na park barefoot, feeling the textures of various sur-\nfaces — sand, sidewalk, grass, gravel. Notice \nhow your feet feel during \nand afterwards. \nEFTA00008114\n\n Chapter 5: A \nMassage Road Map \n69 \n3 \nHead out \nto the woods, a quiet park, or deserted beach and hug a tree, \nor drape yourself luxuriously over a warm \nrock in the sun. \n3 Give a heart-to-heart hug that expresses your affection to someone who \nwould truly appreciate it. \n3 The next time someone you know complains of tight shoulders, offer to \ngive him or her a five minute mini-massage. Don't worry about doing it \n\"right.\" Just focus on caring \nand compassion. \n3 The next time someone you \nwork with does something right, offer a \nheart-felt touch on the arm or \nback in combination with a few words of \npraise. Examine your intentions before making this sort of contact, to \nmake sure you don't \nhave any subconscious motivations that \ncould later \nlead to a sexual harassment case. And \noffer this tactile support in plain \nview \nof other coworkers. \nSo Lithe Time, So \nMany Massages \nOkay, so you're filled \nwith enthusiasm to go out and experience \nyour first \nmassage; you pick up the phone, call \na massage school or clinic in your area, \nand ask to book an appointment. (See Chapter 8 for details on booking an \nappointment). \n\"What kind of bodywork do you prefer?\" asks the receptionist. \n\"Bodywork?\" \n\"Yes. Massage.\" \n\"Oh. Just something that feels \ngood,\" you say. \n\"Of course. But we offer several modalities. \nWould you prefer the Swedish, \nthe sports massage, \nthe deep tissue, the Hellerwork, \nthe Aston repatteming, \nthe Thai massage, or the \nneuromuscular session?\" \n\"Ah, let me get back to you on \nthat,\" you say, and you hang up ready \nto slip \nquietly \nback into your non-massage lifestyle \nbefore you even begin. \nDon't let this scenario happen to you! Now that you've decided to get a mas-\nsage, the last thing you want is to \nget confused by the vast array of choices \navailable \nand end up not receiving any \nkind of massage at all. \nBe forewarned, this section is just an overview of the \ntypes of massage avail-\nable. For now, I just want \nto familiarize you with a few of the choices, based \nupon the three main reasons that \npeople decide to get a massage: \nEFTA00008115\n\n70 \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \n3 To relax \n3 \nTo feel better \n3 To improve your body's functioning \nOften, your reasons are probably a combination of all three. You may have a \nlittle pain in your shoulder you'd like to ease, but \nat \nthe same time, you want \nto lower your overall stress level. The three components of massage dovetail \nwith each other; what helps you relax may lessen your pain, what realigns \nyour body may help you relax, and soon. \nThe spiritual aspect of massage is a fourth component, a wild card that can \npop up unannounced during any type of \nmassage. This spiritual aspect is the \nway that you can use massage to attune to your own inner experience and \nget in touch — literally — with a deeper sense of self. (See Chapter 7 for more \ninformation on this topic.) \nSo which is the right style for \nyou? Take a glance at the following categories \nand become familiar with some of the massage styles associated with each. \nMassage for relaxation \nStress and tension are real. The human body has developed through eons of \nevolution to respond to stress and tension by preparing to either fight the \nobstacle or run away from it. This, the famous fightorllight response, came in \nvery handy \nwhen primitive man was confronted with the occasional, large, \ndangerous animal. But in modern times, people are faced with a constant, \nunceasing barrage of tension-inducing stimuli, and they're getting overloaded \nby it. If you live in a large metropolitan area, for instance, you're being \nexposed to the equivalent of several dozen grizzly bears and a \npack of raven-\nous wolves every time you venture out into \nrush-hour traffic. \nReducing the stress \nand tension in your life is a very good reason for wanting \nto get a massage. You don't need any more justification than that. \nIf you're interested in relaxing massage, ask for the following: \n3 \nSwedish massage: What most people envision when they think \"mas-\nsage.\" This method includes stroking, kneading, squeezing, rubbing, and \nso on. \n3 \nLight work: As in \"not heavy,\" \nlight work is a generic term for non-\nintrusive, \ngentle massage. See the section \"Remodeling your \nbody for fun \nand profit\" later in this chapter for information about deeper \nmassage \nduring which the therapist's fingers \"intrude\" into your musculature. \nEFTA00008116\n\n Chapter 5: A Massage Road Map \n71 \nWhen in Hawaii ... \nOnce, in Hawaii; I was inthe mood fora relaxing \nmassage to help relieve jet lag-after a long trip. \nI was working at a spa there, and one of the \nmassage therapists on staff, a native-Hawaiian \nnamed \nWesley Sen, offered to give me a lomi \nlong massage. \n\"Is that relaxing?\" I  asked as we walked \ntogether back to my hotel room. \n\"Sure it's \nrelaxing,\" he said. \n\"Then why are you carrying \nthat pole with you?\" \nSure enough, Wesley was tarrying a thick, ten-\nfoot long wooden pole in one hand. \"It's just for \nbalance,\" he said. \"Don't worry.\" \nBack in my room, Wesley had me lie down-on \nthe floor and then proceeded to pray over \nme in \nHawaiian, which sets the mood atthe \nbeginning \nof every true lomi lomi experience. In his prayer, \nhe invited:healing forces to be present with us in \nthe \nroom. For \nthe next hour he stood on me, \nkneeled on me, pressed on.me, and-tossed my \nlimbs around, \nall along skillfully keeping his \nweight partially-supported by-the pole, one-end' \nof which he pushed against the floor to balance \nhimself. \nWesley is not a-small guy I was amazed that he \ncould perform \nthis\n-entire-balancing act, using \nmy body as a tightrope, and never once cause \nme the slightest discornfort. Afterwards,. I \nwas \nmore relaxed \nthan I'd felt in mantmonths;the \nrelaxation penetrated way \ndown into my joints \nand up my nerves.into my brain. Also,.a pain I'd \nbeen experiencing in my shoulder disappeared, \nnever \nto return again, and my digestion \nimproved \nnoticeably, too. \nSkillfulyrelaxation \nMassage can take\nbeyond relaxation; healing what ails. otr and \nimproving your body's functioning as- Well. \nSeveral massage styles offer relaxation as well \nas deeply \ntherapeutic results, such as lomi lam', \nTrager, Rubenfeld Synergy, and many others. \nPo Relaxation massage: Another generic term \nfor nice-and-easy massage, \nrelaxation massage usually refers to a light form of Swedish massage. \n3 Esalen massage: Developed at the famous Esalen Institute in Big Sur, \nCalifornia, this massage features many long, flowing, gentle \nstrokes. \nPlenty of massage styles leave you relaxed, but \nthe Swedish style is the one \nyou're \nmost likely to run into. Swedish massage is kind of like the Visa or \nMasterCard of massage, accepted at millions of \nestablishments around the \nworld. It has many therapeutic \nbenefits also, and some of its more \nadvanced \nmoves can be quite vigorous. If your \nintention is simply to chill out and be \nsoothed by soft fingers, make sure to request light, easy pressure during your \nSwedish massage. \nCommunicate! Even if you're just trading \nmassage with a friend, you have to \nlet the other \nperson know what you want out of the experience. \nEFTA00008117\n\n72\n \nPart II: The Art of Receiving Massage  \nPr massage \nMany people visit their massage therapist for the same reason they visit their \ndoctor — to fix something that's painful. This type of massage Is called reme-\ndial massage, because it's used as a remedy. Several types of massage, \nincluding good-old, relaxing Swedish massage, can have definite remedial \neffects; but here's a short list of some styles particularly well-known for \nbelonging to \nthe \"massage apothecary.\" \nOf course, only well-trained professionals should attempt to give these types \nof massage. \nIf you're interested in remedial massage, ask for the following: \n3 \nManual lymphatic drainage: This type of massage helps your body \nflush toxins, such as pesticides and residual chemicals, by stimulating \nthe flow of lymph in your body. It's a very gentle massage that features \nlight superficial movements on the skin. \n3 Touch for health: This treatment, which helps balance \nyour inner heal-\ning energies, isn't really a massage at all because the therapist's hands \ndon't necessarily come into contact with the recipient's body. The tech-\nnique was developed by a nurse on the faculty at New York University \nand has been taught to thousands of healthcare practitioners. \n3 Neuromuscular therapy: This type of massage \nworks on tight muscles \nthat create the deep patterns of tension \nthat can keep you in pain. \n3 Cranio-sacral: This type of massage adjusts \nthe healthy functioning of \nyour spine and cranium. \n3 Deep tissue massage: This generic term refers to any number of thera-\npies that apply deep pressure and \naffect the body's connective tissues. \n3 Shiatsu: This massage \ninvolves pressure point therapy — to balance the \nentire body and restore \nhealth — on specific points along invisible \nenergy lines In the body called meridians. \nShiatsu is the most well-known of several types of massage that work on \nthe meridians. It can be quite \nrelaxing, but its primary focus is on restor-\ning health and balance, \nas are other types of massage that work on \nthese \nenergy lines. \nAfter having a \nserious car accident, a young man in Ohio \nbegan experiencing \nsevere, debilitating pain every day. His doctors told him \nthey had no drugs or \nsurgery that could help him and that he'd have to learn to live with the pain, \nbut his mother decided there must be \na better way. She took him to see a \nmassage therapist who \ntreated the young man for several months using \nneu-\nromuscular and cranlo-sacral therapies. The end result was a pain-free young \nman who has \nnow decided to become a massage therapist himself in order to \nhelp other people. \nEFTA00008118\n\n Chapter 5: A Massage \nRoad Map 73 \nRemodeling \nyour body for fun and profit \nSeveral types \nof massage have developed over the \nyears that focus on \nrealigning your body, straightening you out, \nhelping you form a healthier rela-\ntionship with gravity and a more graceful, efficient way of moving. People \noften refer to this type of massage as structural \nbodywork. You only want to \nsign up for one of these \nif you have specific goals in mind (such \nas improved \nposture, better athletic \nperformance, and soon.) and, of course, you want a \nhighly trained pro to do the work. The movements involved are quite deep, \nand the experience is not \n\"relaxing\" in the normal sense of the \nword, but your \nmassage therapist will always keep \nyour comfort foremost in mind. \nIf you're interested in structural massage, ask for the \nfollowing: \n3 Rolling: The most well-known form or \nstructural bodywork, this type of \nmassage was invented by Ida Rolf. \n3 Hellerwork: A unique development of Rolfing, this type of massage was \ncreated by Joseph Heller. \n3 Aston patterning: This type of massage is a combination of touch tech-\nniques and movement repatteming that \nhelps people move with ease \nand improve their posture. \n3 \nMyofascial \nrelease: This \ntype of massage is a combination of \ntechniques \nthat combine to \"unwind\" and \nrelease chronic tension patterns in deep \ntissues, which can cause many painful conditions. \nTouch Terminology \nMassage has its own lingo, much of \nwhich can be somewhat confusing at \nfirst. Massage lingo can also be intimidating, for two main reasons: \n3 Some massage \nterminology has origins in the \nmedical field and can \nsound academically dense. \n3 \nSome of the words used are Just \nplain weird (and the only people you've \nheard speak them before are sophisticated, semi-naked celebrities on \nLifestyles of the Rich & Famous). \nTruthfully, though, no insider's massage clique \nis sitting around in cashmere \nrobes at some \nexclusive, country-club spa, ready to snicker at you for not \nknowing what the word \"acupressure\" means. Most of the massage words \nyou encounter are the result of \ncultural influences from around the \nworld, \nwith a \nmedical/scientific reference thrown in \nnow and then. \nEFTA00008119",
