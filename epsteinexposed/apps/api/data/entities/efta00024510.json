    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nSubject: Re: JE estate meeting \nDate: Sat, 21 Dec 2019 00:42:50 +0000 \nThe protective order required defense counsel to destroy all materials we produced to them at the end of the case, \nand Epstein's lawyers told us they did so at the nolle conference. \nOn \nDec 20, 2019, at 5:17 PM, wrote: \nWe're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct \ncriminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search \nwarrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's \ncriminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USAO_4381-4445, but \npotentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a \nprotective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of \nthe search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and \nI hope this is useful in the interim. \nSeparately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential \nforfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide \nthese dates in connection with your request). \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSen • ember 19 2019 19:09 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: JE estate meeting \na \nTo follow up on our call, can you please send us the search warrant returns/inventories and, if possible, any additional \ndetail regarding the items that were seized in the two searches of the New York property and the search of the New \nMexico property. \nWith respect to a next meeting with you and the Chief of the Criminal Division and, of course, any other colleagues you \nwish to attend, the following dates in early January would be good for us: \nJanuary 3, 6 (before 2:00), 7, 8 (1:00 or later), 9 (after 11:00), or 10 \nHappy and Healthy New Year from Andy and me. \nEFTA00024510\n\nPartner \nCo-Chair.
