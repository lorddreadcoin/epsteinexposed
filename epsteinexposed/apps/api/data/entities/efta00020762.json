I was paid by Jeffrey Epstein to interact \nsexually with him as a minor \non dozens of occasions in \nhis \nmansion in \nPalm Beach, Florida \nfrom \naround 2002 to 2005, and also to \nbring him other girls who were my \napproximate age for the same purposes. I understand that evidence \ncollected from Epstein's home showed \nconclusively that I was there \nas a minor, \nalong with many other underage girls. Given how many \ngirls Epstein was sexually abusing, there could not have been any \ndoubt in \nanyone's mind that had access to the testimonial and other \nevidence that Epstein sexually molested me as a minor (and many \nothers). \n3. My son was very young when \nthe FBI came to speak with me the first \ntime. I \ndid not know what to do and I was scared. I called Epstein, \nwho told me not to worry and that he would hire an attorney \nfor me. I \nbelieved \nthat if I told the truth about what happened at Epstein's \nhouse, the police would take my baby from me. That made \nme really \nscared. \n4. Through the \nattorney that Jeffrey Epstein obtained for me, it was \narranged for me to give a statement to the prosecutor investigating \nEpstein. \n5. While with the attorney Epstein obtained \nfor me I gave a statement to \nthe prosecutor \nthat was favorable to Epstein. The prosecutors \nknew \nthe truth because of the volume of evidence they had, and they \ncontinued to recognize me as a victim \nof Epstein's crimes. \n6. I had been greatly intimidated, which is why I could not be \ntruthful \ninitially and I wanted to end the threat of the possibility of my child \nbeing taken. My \ninvolvement with Epstein from a very young age \nwas a deep, dark secret and \nEpstein told me to keep it a secret. I knew \nthat I \nwas \nexpected to keep it a \nsecret. \n7. \nThe \nmore I \nthought about what was going on, \nthe more I realized that \nwhat Epstein had done to both \nme and my \nfriends \nwas wrong and that \nanyone who was \nnot very wealthy \nwould be \npunished. At this time, I \nEFTA00020763\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM \nDocument 361-27 \nEntered on FLSD Docket \n02/10/2016 Page 3 of 4 \nwanted Epstein held accountable the same way \nanyone else would be. \nI spoke about this \nwith one of my friends around \nMay 2008. I then \ncalled an attorney, Brad \nEdwards, around June 2008, understanding \nthat he was hired to get the \nprosecutors to talk to us and hear the truth \nfrom \nme. That was especially important to me \nbecause I was fmally \nrepresented by someone other than \nEpstein's attorney and wanted to \ntalk \nto the prosecutors about everything I \nknew. \n8. \nThe \nprosecutors \nhad a lot of \ninformation revealing the \ntruth \nabout \nthe \nsituation at Epstein's house. I had lot of information, too, because I \nwas one of the young teenagers \nwho had brought many other young \nteenagers to Epstein for the purpose of getting \npaid by Epstein. I \nwanted to assist the prosecutors in the investigation. I hired Mr. \nEdwards to let them know that I was cooperative and ready to tell \nthem all of the helpful information I had. I understood that Mr. \nEdwards did \nthat. \n9. I authorized Mr. Edwards to join me in the lawsuit against the U.S. \nAttorney's Office to enforce \nmy rights and to try to get me my chance \nto confer with the prosecutors before Mr. \nEpstein took a plea or the \ncase was resolved in any way. I just wanted to be treated fairly in the \nprocess. \n10. \nWhen Epstein pled guilty to a state crime at the end of June 2008, \nno one notified me that his plea \nhad anything to do with my case \nagainst him. I did not know, for example, that this plea had some \nconnection to a crime he committed against \nme particularly. In fact, \nat this young age, I had no idea what was going on and nobody tried \nto explain it to me. \n11. In July 2008, I attended a federal court hearing \nwith Mr. Edwards. \nIt was then that I learned for the first time at that hearing that the \nprosecutors worked out some sort of secret deal with Epstein that \nmight block his prosecution for crimes against me. It also appeared \nthat there was a lot of \ncontinued communication between Epstein and \nthe U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. I was \nreally upset \nthat the U.S. \nAttorney's \nOffice \nseemed like it \nwould not talk \nwith me or the \nother \nvictims about \nwhat was going on. It was easier to get \nthem to talk to \nme when I was represented by Epstein's attorney. \nEFTA00020764\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-27 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 4 of 4 \n12. I \nwanted to see this \nsecret deal that the \nGovernment \nhad with \nEpstein, but they \nwould not give it \nto me at the \nhearing. Later, the \nother \nvictims and I finally \ngot to see the \nsecret deal after the \njudge \nforced the prosecutors to \nshow it to us. \n13. I \nunderstand that I did not \ninitially help the \ninvestigation by \nspeaking on \nEpstein's behalf \nuntruthfully. But I was \nintimidated and \nhad \ngood reason to protect \nmyself and my son \n— reasons that I \nthink \neveryone who was \ntalking to me could \nobviously see. Also, the \nagents and \nattorneys obviously had \na lot of evidence \nthat provided \nproof of \nwhat Epstein had actually \ndone. Epstein was still \nsupporting \nme, \nproviding me a lawyer and \nin my mind protecting me, \nso I was in \na position \nwhere I felt I had to say certain \nthings. And Epstein \nexpected me to say those things. \n14. \nOnce I wanted to \ncooperate and tried to \ncooperate, I was never \ngiven the opportunity to \nconfer with prosecutors from the time they \nwere \ninformed by my attorney that I \nwas a cooperating witness. I \nwas \nnever told about the secret deal \nuntil after it was already concluded. \nI \nwould have had my \nattorney object if I had \nbeen given the chance. \n15. I don't \nfeel like I was treated fairly \nin this process. And I \nknow \nEpstein got a really good \nplea deal because he is rich \nand powerful. \nThat doesn't seem \nfair either. \nExecuted this   092  411 \n, day of \nJanuary, 2015. \nEFTA00020765",
