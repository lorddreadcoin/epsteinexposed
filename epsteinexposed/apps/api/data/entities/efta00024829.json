Let me know. Thanks. \nNovember 29, 2021 update: \nVictim Attendance at Trial. In orders dated October 14 and November 24, 2021, the S.D.N.Y. \nCourt outlined procedures for public access to the trial in this matter. (Trial began on November \n29, 2021, with jury selection.) Specifically, consistent with the District's COVID-19 protocols, the \nCourt will ensure public access (with COVID- 19 distancing) to the trial in the courtroom itself and \nin several overflow rooms at the courthouse with live feeds of the proceedings. Beyond the live \nfeeds within the courthouse, the trial will not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic \ndial-in to the proceedings. Victim access will be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office Victim-\nWitness Coordinator \nthose persons for further information. \nVictims who wish to attend the trial may contact either one of \nCOVID- I 9  Protocols. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any \nS.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a  questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to \nentering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at \nthe courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire \nand whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All \nvisitors must wear a  mask that covers the person's nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and \nmasks with valves are not permitted. If a  person does not have an approved mask, a screener \nwill provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been \nadopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. For more \ninformation, please see https://www.nysd.uscourts.govicovid-19-coronavinis.\nThanks. \nEFTA00024829",
