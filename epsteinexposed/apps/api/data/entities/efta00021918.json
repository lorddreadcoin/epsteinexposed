As we discussed, although \nthis does not represent a version that has been formally approved internally at our Office, it is an effort to include the \nupdates and edits we talked through yesterday. I believe this should represent what we addressed, but I also realize that \nwe've revised some aspects that you mentioned you'd need to further consider, and there is some new proposed \nlanguage in areas you suggested we clarify, so I expect it may be useful to chat again once you've reviewed. All that said, \nwe wanted to get you the revised version quickly, and I'm happy to discuss again, including anytime this weekend if that's \nhelpful, to go through any outstanding issues. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nChristian Everdell \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 20:13 \nTo: \n•c> \nC \nCc: Mark S. Cohen ,:); Jeff Pagliuca < 'Laura \nMenninger' \nSubject: Protective Order \nAttached is a revised draft of the defense's proposed Protective Order (including a redline against the government's \noriginal draft and a clean version). We did our best to incorporate the points we discussed on our last call on Monday, July \n20 and to find points of common ground and agreement. Please let us know by 5pm tomorrow whether the attached \ndraft is acceptable to the Government. \nRegards, \nChris \nChristian \nEverdell \nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York.
