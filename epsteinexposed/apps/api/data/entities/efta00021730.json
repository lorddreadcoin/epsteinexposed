Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. \n330 (AJN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court \norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the \ngovernment so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays. \nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop \ncomputer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard \ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends \nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery. \nHowever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions \nof the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several \ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the \nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in \ndiscovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July 12, 2021 trial date, she must \nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays. \nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms. \nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the \ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to \nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success. \nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to \nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire 14-day \nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2020 because she had \ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In \naddition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it \nEFTA00021730\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document \n116 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 2 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nJanuary 14, 2021 \nPage 2 \nwould not require any change in Ms. Maxwell's movements to give her the requested access. \nFurthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell's \nsecurity team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend. \nThere is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms. \nMaxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that \nMs. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be \ngiven as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully \nrequest that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and \nholidays during the hours that she is permitted to review discovery. \nSincerely, \n/s/ Christian Everdell \nChristian R.
