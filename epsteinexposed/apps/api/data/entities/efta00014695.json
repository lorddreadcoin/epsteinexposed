See Dkt. Nos. 473, 474, and 476. \nAttached are our proposed redactions. We have no redactions to our motion to quash. Our understanding is that the \ndefense is not proposing any redactions. \nWe propose that we will file a cover letter on the docket and send these all to the Court. After that, we'll file the redacted \nversions of our motions and you can file your responses, and we'll wait for you to file your redacted GX-52 brief before we \nfile our reply. \nPlease let us know if that works for you. \nThanks, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, New York 10007 \nEFTA00014695",
