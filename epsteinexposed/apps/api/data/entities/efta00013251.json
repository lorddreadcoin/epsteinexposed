So \nunless you want to discuss, I plan to agree to the former and confirm the latter. I ran it by just to be safe. \nEFTA00013251\n\nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:58 PM \nTo: 'Marty Weinberg' <marty@martinweinberglaw.com>; Miller, Michael .ic> \nCc: ; Weingarten, Reid \nSubject: RE: privilege review contact information \nMarty, Mike, \nFollowing up on our conversation this afternoon via phone, I wanted to put you in touch directly with who \nis the Office's Privilege Review Logistic Coordinator.
