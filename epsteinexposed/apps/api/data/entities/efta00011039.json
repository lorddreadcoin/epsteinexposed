He was \narrested on charges of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist \norganization and attempting to murder U.S. military service members. He faces up to 40 years in prison. \n•  \"Cole James Bridges: is positive in FBI holdings.

He was \nawaiting arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court. \nA search warrant return - a document which lists what was seized in a search - visible in the Chevrolet 1500 Tahoe SUV \nlisted the shotgun, six cases of shotgun shells, 12 boxes of .9-mm ammunition, a black tactical vest with a loaded clip, eight \nmore loaded clips, a second vest with ballistic plates and a knife, and two machetes. \nMembers of the Joint Terrorism Task Force huddled around Fisher's SUV as cops blocked E. 88th St. after making the \narrest. Video from the scene showed an FBI officer carrying the shotgun seized from the SUV to an evidence van. \nAlso spotted in the car were an American flag, a copy of the Daily News with President Trump's face on it, an emergency \nponcho and B12 vitamins. \nIt wasn't immediately clear if Fisher is accused of being part of the Capitol siege or was arrested purely for online activity. \nA second man, Patrick Edward McCaughey III, was arrested Tuesday night in the upstate town of South Salem. He is in \ncustody and will be arraigned later Wednesday in White Plains Federal Court. \nMcCaughey is charged with using a riot shield to press against a Capitol police officer shown on video screaming as he's \nsqueezed between a door in the midst of a violent confrontation with rioters at a key entry point in the Capitol, law \nenforcement sources said. The arrests followed dozens of others across the nation as federal authorities seek to hold people \nwho stormed the Capitol responsible for their conduct, as well as anyone making online threats to kill elected officials. Five \npeople died in the Capitol riot, including a police officer, in the hours-long siege that took place after President Trump \nextorted a crowd to march to the Capitol. The unrest came as Congress was certifying the electoral college votes that won \nSen. Joe Biden the presidency. \nhttp://www.nydailynews.cominew-york/nyc-crime/ny-capitol-riot-aftermath-arrest-upper-east-side-\n20210120-xxjogypbpfavteabboxdhlaou4-story.html\nTerror cells in Indonesia continue to recruit and plot attacks amid COVID-19 - As Indonesia grapples with the \nimpact of COV1D-19, terrorism cells in the country continue to spread radical messages, actively seeking new recruits \nand plotting their next attacks, a senior counterterrorism official said. \nIn an exclusive interview with CNA, the National Counter Terrorism Agency's (BNPT) director for enforcement, \nEddy Hartono said although there has been no major terrorist attack during the pandemic, terrorism cells in Indonesia \n\"are not sifting back and relaxing.\" \n\"They are actively recruiting, spreading their ideology, raising funds and conducting training,\" the Brigadier General \nsaid, adding that the only thing that has slowed during the pandemic is the sending of militants to join the ranks of the \nIslamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nThe police's counterterrorism unit Densus 88 arrested a total of 232 people last year for alleged involvement in \nterrorism activities. \n\"They are indeed planning attacks on security officials, state institutions, military and the police,\" Mr Hartono said. \n\"Thank goodness we have been able to prevent (these attacks) from happening.\" \nAmong those who were arrested last year were two of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists Zulkamaen and Upik \nLawanga who have evaded capture for 19 and 14 years respectively. \nZulkarnaen, who goes by one name, was believed to be behind at least three terror attacks, including the 2002 Bali \nBombings while Upik Lawanga was suspected of aiding a series of terror attacks between 2004 and 2006.

ICCT highlighted \nareas of terrorism financing including cryptocurrencies, criminal activities, hawala networks, and more. \nEFTA00011040\n\nA major area of focus was the increasing trend of terrorists using localized financing, otherwise known \nas \"funding in place.\" \n(U) Whereas al-Qa'ida historically financed its affiliate groups and actors from afar, sending money for \nrecruitment, transportation, training, etc., terrorist groups today are less reliant on funding from group \nleadership. \"Funding in place\" not only provides a layer of security by not having to worry about financial and \nintelligence tools interrupting funding streams, but also makes it significantly harder to detect possible terrorist \nfinancing scenarios and future attack plans.
