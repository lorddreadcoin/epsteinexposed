Among our questions was who, whether at ODAG, SDFL, or NDGA we should be in touch with at this point \nregarding documents. I also know OPR did a significant document collection last year. \nWe will reach back to OPR, but if there is a particular point of contact at SDFL or NDGA on issues related to document \ncollection, in particular, please let us know. And if a call on those issues would be helpful, happy to set one up. \nThanks very much, \nFrom: (ODAG) \nSent: Wednesday, July 22, 2020 10:56 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \nCc: (USANYS) \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell \n(ODAG) \nHappy to talk, but my only real role related to recusal issues and consequences. Now that the CVRA litigation is over, you \nprobably are best going directly to SDFL, as I don't have any of their documents.

We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential \ndocument/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were \nlargely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, \nanticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week \nfor a  quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you. \nThanks very much, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00027960\n\nTel. \nEFTA00027961",
