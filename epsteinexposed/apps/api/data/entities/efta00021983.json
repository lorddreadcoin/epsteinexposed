Did you want to produce the full family of documents or just the documents tagged as listed \nbelow (ex. produce as is, produce as is and confidential, produce as is and highly confidential)? \nThank you. \nFro  \nSent: Tuesda October 13 2020 11:17 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Discovery Tasks for Maxwell on Epstein Relativity Databases \nThanks very much for speaking earlier today. As discussed, we are asking for the following three productions to be \nprepared for the Maxwell case. I've listed those tasks below in the order in which we discussed them, but, as we \ndiscussed, if you and the vendor believe a different order would be more efficient, please just let me know. \nEFTA00021983\n\nAs we've discussed, we need all of these materials to be delivered to 1St. Andrews by the end of October in order to \nmeet our discovery deadline. \nFinally, I believhould be sending you a drive containing the scans of boxes of files from the USAO-SDFL. \nWe need all of those files loaded into the US v Epstein database on Relativity in a new folder entitled \"USAO-SDFL Files,\" \nASAP so that we can review them, please. \nThanks very much, as always for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions or \nconfusion. I'm always happy to chat. \nThanks so much, \nEFTA00021984",
