Everdell, an attorney duly admitted to practice in New York State and \nbefore this Court, declare the following is true and correct under penalty of perjury pursuant to \n28 \nU.S.C. § 1746: \n1. I am a partner at Cohen & Gresser LLP, counsel for defendant Ghislaine Maxwell \nin the above-captioned case. \n2. I certify pursuant to Local Criminal Rule 16.1 that defense counsel \nhas conferred \nin good faith with Assistant U.S. Attorneys and \nregarding the government's proposed protective order pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. \n3. While the parties have been able to agree on most of the provisions of the \nprotective order, we have been unable to resolve two narrow areas of dispute. \na. First, the defense believes that potential government witnesses and their \ncounsel should be subject to the same restrictions as the defense concerning \nappropriate use of the discovery materials—namely, if these individuals are \ngiven access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not use \nEFTA00029877\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 30 Filed 07/27/20 Page 2 of 2 \nthose materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal \ncase, and may not post those materials on the Internet. \nb. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted from publicly \ndisclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential \nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified \nthemselves by speaking on the public record. \nI hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true. I am aware that if any of the \nforegoing statements are willfully false, I am subject to punishment. \nDated: July 27, 2020 /s/ Christian R. Everdell \nNew York, New York Christian R.
