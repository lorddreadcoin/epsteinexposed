The charges set forth herein stem from the role \nof GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation \nand abuse of multiple minor \ngirls by Jeffrey Epstein. In \nparticular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including \nat least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and \ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among \nother things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately \nabuse \nvictims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be \nunder the age \nof \n18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they \nwere \ngroomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew \nthat certain victims were in fact under the age of 16. \n2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to \nabuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, and \nJeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor \nvictims to travel to \nGM_GLSDN Y_00000470 \nEFTA00008998\n\n2 \nEpstein's \nresidences in \ndifferent states, \nwhich \nMAXWELL knew \nand \nintended would result in their grooming for and subjection to \nsexual abuse. Moreover, \nin an effort to conceal her crimes, \nMAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned \nabout her conduct, \nincluding in relation to some of the minor victims described \nherein, \nwhen providing testimony under oath in 2016. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n' 3. During the time periods charged in this \nIndictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, had a personal and \nprofessional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein \nand was among his \nclosest \nassociates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and \nin \nor \nabout 1997, \nMAXWELL was in an \nintimate \nrelationship with \nEpstein and \nalso was paid by Epstein to manage his various \nproperties. Over \nthe course of their relationship, MAXWELL and \nEpstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, \nincluding in the below image: \nGIA_GLSDNYJKENM71 \nEFTA00008999\n\n4. \nBeginning in at \nleast 1994, \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, \nthe \ndefendant, enticed and \ngroomed multiple \nminor girls to \nengage in sex \nacts with Jeffrey \nEpstein, through \na variety of \nmeans \nand methods, \nincluding but not \nlimited to the \nfollowing: \na. \nMAXWELL first \nattempted to befriend some \nof \nEpstein's minor \nvictims prior to \ntheir abuse, \nincluding by \nasking \nthe victims \nabout their \nlives, their \nschools, and their \nfamilies. \nMAXWELL and \nEpstein would spend time \nbuilding \nfriendships with \nminor victims by, for \nexample, taking \nminor \nvictims \nto the movies or \nshopping. Some \nof these outings \nwould \ninvolve MAXWELL \nand Epstein \nspending time together \nwith a minor \nvictim, while some \nwould involve \nMAXWELL or Epstein \nspending \ntime alone \nwith a minor \nvictim. \nb. Having \ndeveloped a rapport \nwith a victim, \nMAXWELL \nwould try to \nnormalize sexual abuse \nfor a minor victim \nby, among \nother things, \ndiscussing sexual \ntopics, undressing in \nfront \nof the victim, \nbeing present \nwhen a minor \nvictim was \nundressed, \nand/or being present \nfor sex acts \ninvolving the \nminor \nvictim and Epstein. \nc. MAXWELL'S \npresence \nduring minor victims' \ninteractions with Epstein, \nincluding \ninteractions where the \nminor \nvictim was \nundressed or that \ninvolved sex acts \nwith \nEpstein, \nhelped put the \nvictims at ease \nbecause an \nadult woman \nwas present. \nFor example, in \nsome instances, \nMAXWELL would \n3 \nGM_GLSDN Y_00000472 \nEFTA00009000\n\nmassage Epstein in \nfront of a minor \nvictim. In other \ninstances, \nMAXWELL \nencouraged minor \nvictims to provide \nmassages to Epstein, \nincluding sexualized \nmassages \nduring which a minor \nvictim would \nbe fully \nor partially nude. \nMany of those \nmassages resulted in \nEpstein \nsexually abusing the \nminor victims. \nd. In \naddition, Epstein \noffered to help some \nminor \nvictims by \npaying for travel \nand/or educational \nopportunities, and \nMAXWELL \nencouraged certain \nvictims to accept \nEpstein's \nassistance. As a \nresult, victims \nwere made to \nfeel \nindebted and \nbelieved that \nMAXWELL and Epstein were \ntrying to \nhelp them. \ne. Through \nthis process, \nMAXWELL and Epstein \nenticed \nvictims to \nengage in sexual \nactivity with \nEpstein. In \nsome \ninstances, MAXWELL \nwas present for \nand participated \nin the \nsexual abuse of \nminor victims. \nSome such incidents \noccurred in \nthe context of \nmassages, which \ndeveloped into sexual \nencounters. \n5. \nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, the \ndefendant, \nfacilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's \naccess to minor \nvictims knowing that \nhe had a \nsexual \npreference for \nunderage girls and \nthat he \nintended to \nengage in \nsexual activity with \nthose victims. \nEpstein's \nresulting abuse of \nminor victims \nincluded, among other \nthings, \ntouching \na victim's \nbreast, touching a \nvictim's genitals, \nplacing a sex \ntoy such as a \nvibrator on a \nvictim's genitals, \n4 \nGM_GJ_SDNY_00000473 \nEFTA00009001\n\ndirecting a victim to \ntouch Epstein \nwhile he \nmasturbated, and \ndirecting a \nvictim to touch \nEpstein's genitals. \nMAXWELL AND \nEPSTEIN'S VICTIMS \n6. Between \napproximately in or \nabout 1994 and in or \nabout \n1997, GHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the defendant, \nfacilitated \nJeffrey Epstein's \naccess to minor \nvictims by, among other \nthings, inducing and \nenticing, and \naiding and abetting \nthe \ninducement and \nenticement of, \nmultiple minor victims. \nVictims \nwere \ngroomed and/or abused \nat multiple \nlocations, including the \nfollowing: \na. \nA a multi-story \nprivate residence on \nthe \nUpper \nEast Side of \nManhattan, New. York owned \nby Epstein (the \n\"New York \nResidence\"), which is \ndepicted in the \nfollowing \nphotograph: \nGM_GJ_SDNY_00000474 \nEFTA00009002\n\nb. An \nestate in Palm Beach, \nFlorida owned by \nEpstein \n(the \"Palm Beach \nResidence\"), which is depicted in the \nfollowing \nphotograph: \nc. \nA ranch in Santa Fe, New \nMexico owned by \nEpstein (the \n\"New Mexico Residence\"), \nwhich is depicted in \nthe \nfollowing photograph: \n6 \nGM_GJ_SDNY_00000475 \nEFTA00009003\n\nd. \nMAXWELL's personal \nresidence in London, \nEngland. \n7. Among \nthe victims \ninduced or enticed by \nGHISLAINE \nMAXWELL, the \ndefendant, were minor \nvictims identified \nherein as \nMinor Victim\n-1, Minor Victim-2, \nand Minor Victim-3. \nIn \nparticular, and during \ntime periods relevant \nto this Indictment, \nMAXWELL engaged in the \nfollowing acts, \namong others, with \nrespect to \nminor \nvictims: \na. MAXWELL \nmet Minor Victim-1 \nwhen Minor \nVictim-1 \nwas approximately 14 \nyears old. MAXWELL \nsubsequently \ninteracted with Minor \nVictim-1 on \nmultiple occasions at \nEpstein's \nresidences, \nknowing that Minor Victim\n-1 was under the \nage of \n18 at the time. \nDuring these \ninteractions, \nwhich took \nplace \nbetween \napproximately 1994 and 1997, \nMAXWELL groomed \nMinor \nVictim-1 to engage \nin sexual acts \nwith Epstein through \nmultiple \nmeans. First, \nMAXWELL and Epstein \nattempted to befriend Minor \nVictim-1, \ntaking her to the \nmovies and on \nshopping trips. \nMAXWELL also asked \nMinor Victim-1 about \nschool, her classes, her \nfamily, and \nother aspects of \nher life. \nMAXWELL then sought to \nnormalize \ninappropriate and abusive \nconduct by, among other \nthings, undressing in \nfront of Minor \nVictim-1 and being present \nwhen Minor \nVictim-1 \nundressed in front of \nEpstein. Within the \nfirst year \nafter MAXWELL and \nEpstein met Minor \nVictim-1, Epstein \nbegan \nsexually abusing \nMinor Victim-1. \nMAXWELL was present \nfor \n7 \nGM_GLSDNY_00000476 \nEFTA00009004\n\nand \ninvolved in some of \nthis abuse. In \nparticular, MAXWELL \ninvolved Minor \nVictim-1 in group \nsexualized massages of \nEpstein. \nDuring \nthose group \nsexualized massages, \nMAXWELL and/or \nMinor \nVictim-1 \nwould engage in sex acts \nwith Epstein. Epstein \nand \nMAXWELL both \nencouraged Minor Victim\n-1 to travel to \nEpstein's \nresidences in both New \nYork and Florida. As \na result, Minor \nVictim-1 \nwas sexually abused \nby Epstein in \nboth New York and \nFlorida. Minor Victim\n-1 was enticed to \ntravel across state \nlines for the \npurpose of sexual \nencounters with \nEpstein, and \nMAXWELL was \naware that Epstein \nengaged in sexual \nactivity with \nMinor \nVictim-1 after \nMinor-Victim-1 traveled \nto Epstein's \nproperties, \nincluding in the \ncontext of a \nsexualized massage. \nb. \nMAXWELL \ninteracted with Minor \nVictim-2 on at \nleast one \noccasion in or \nabout 1996 at \nEpstein's residence in \nNew Mexico when \nMinor Victim-2 was \nunder the age of 18. \nMinor \nVictim-2 had flown \ninto New Mexico from \nout of state at \nEpstein's \ninvitation for the \npurpose of being groomed \nfor and/or \nsubjected to \nacts of sexual \nabuse. MAXWELL \nknew that Minor \nVictim-2 was \nunder the age of \n16 at the time. \nWhile in New \nMexico, MAXWELL and \nEpstein took Minor \nVictim-2 to a movie \nand \nMAXWELL took Minor \nVictim-2 shopping. \nMAXWELL also discussed \nMinor \nVictim-2's school, \nclasses, and family with \nMinor Victim-\n2. In New \nMexico, MAXWELL began \nher efforts to groom \nMinor \nVictim-2 \nfor abuse by \nEpstein by, among other \nthings, providing \n8 \nGM_GLSDN Y_00000477 \nEFTA00009005\n\nan \nunsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor \nVictim-2 was topless. \nMAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to \nmassage Epstein. \nc. \nMAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor \nVictim-3 in London, England \nbetween approximately 1994 and 1995, \nincluding during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew \nthat \nMinor Victim-3 \nwas under the age of 18. Among other \nthings, \nMAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life \nand family with Minor \nVictim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and \narranged for \nmultiple interactions \nbetween Minor \nVictim-3 and \nEpstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged \nMinor \nVictim-3 to \nmassage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage \nin sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those \nmassages. Minor \nVictim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and \nduring those \nmassages, \nEpstein \nsexually abused Minor Victim-3. \nMAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual \nactivity with \nMinor Victim-3 on \nmultiple occasions, including at times when \nMinor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context \nof a sexualized \nmassage. \nMAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT \n8.
