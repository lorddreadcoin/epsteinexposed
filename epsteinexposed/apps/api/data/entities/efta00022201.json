    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: Gary Bloxsome <1.> \nCc: Daniel Cund • Jennifer Richardson \nSubject: RE: Sensitive \nCorrespondence \nDate: Mon, 10 Aug 2020 17:20:04 +0000 \nlane-Images: image001.jpg; image002.jpg \nGary, \nWe write to follow up on our prior discussions. As discussed on our last call, our standard proffer agreement \nunderstandably has different provisions and protections than would result from a compelled interview pursuant to an \nMLAT request. It is often the case that individuals who want to voluntarily assist with our investigations do not require any \nprotections, but nevertheless, when individuals we are seeking to interview do request certain protections as part of a \nvoluntary interview, we ordinarily find that the proffer agreement language is appropriate and sufficient. Nevertheless, \nbased on your queries, we would be prepared to include the following language in a proffer agreement governing a \nvoluntary, live interview of your client: \n- Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or disclose the content of the witness's statements \nin an interview with law enforcement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or related \ncivil action or asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government. \nWe are not able to provide a broader grant of immunity with respect to statements made by your client during a voluntary \ninterview. As we discussed on the phone, in a voluntary interview the individual being interviewed has the right to choose \nnot to answer any particular question, has the right to consult with counsel at any time, and may explain the context or \nbasis of answers to whatever extent necessary. Accordingly, and also considering the obvious problems with granting \nbroad immunity to an interviewee for statements not yet made, we do not believe it would be necessary or appropriate \nto further diverge from our standard practice. We are also not aware of any treaty provision that would preclude \nprosecution for intentional and willful false or misleading statements. \nRegarding your request that we provide subject areas of the interview in advance, we have generally described those \nsubjects with you in our phone conversations, but we reiterate them here for your convenience. In a voluntary interview \nwith your client, we would expect to ask questions (and follow-up questions, as appropriate), about topics including, and \nwith the understanding that the answers to questions about these topics might naturally flow into additional topics, the \nfollowing: the duration and nature of your client's relationships with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein, and their \nrespective (or joint) employees or associates; communications your client has had relating to individuals associated with \nGhislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, including communications in person, via phone, via email, or via other means, and \nincluding but not limited to communications with Maxwell or Epstein themselves; any such communications your client \nhad, or was aware of, with or about potential or actual contact with girls or women in connection with sexual activity or \npossible sexual activity; and information relating to any other individuals of whom your client is aware who might have \ninformation relating to these or other similar topics. These subjects would naturally include, but not be limited to, \nquestions relating to any individuals who have made public accusations that relate to our investigation. This description is \nnot meant to be exhaustive or exclusive, but rather to guide your understanding of the kind of information we believe \nyour client may be able to provide to assist our investigation. \nFinally, you previously have asked if we are able to state whether individuals have made accusations that your client \ncommitted a crime. To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, we want to reiterate that we are not able to convey any \nconfidential information from our investigation, including any potential witness statements or other investigative results, \nas they relate to any particular individual, including your client, other than through judicial processes. As I have noted \npreviously, we obviously are aware of certain accusations made publicly. \nWe look forward to speaking with you tomorrow. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nEFTA00022201\n\nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, August 05, 2020 16:38 \nTo: Gary Bloxsome \nCc: Daniel Cundy ; Jennifer Richardson ; \nSubject: RE: Sensitive Correspondence \nGary, \nWe've received the below, thank you.

Although \nthe knowing and willful element in particular is identical, we nevertheless wanted to provide this to you as well. \nPursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instruction 36-9 (Elements of the Offense), those elements are: \nFirst, on or about the date specified, the defendant made a statement or representation; \nSecond, that this statement or representation was material; \nEFTA00022203\n\nThird, the statement or representation was false, fictitious or fraudulent; \nFourth, the false, fictitious or fraudulent statement was made knowingly and willfully; and \nFifth, the statement or representation was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the government of the United \nStates (or federal funds were involved). \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, July 28, 2020 18:29 \nTo: Gary Bloxsome \nCc: Daniel Cundy Jennifer Richardson \n< \n>; \n) `z> \nSubject: RE: Sensitive Correspondence \nGary, \nWe write to follow up on our conversation yesterday, to confirm certain aspects of our discussion and to provide \ncertain information you requested. First, thank you for conveying your questions, and I hope our initial responses were \nof some use. To provide additional information that may be helpful, attached please find a blank proffer agreement, \nwhich is our standard form agreement for proffer interviews, as you requested. Please note that in addition to the \nprovisions I briefly described on our call, there are also provisions that may not be relevant to your client. We \nnevertheless send the complete agreement for your review. \nAdditionally, and also as requested, certain information relating to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, is \nprovided below. \nIn relevant part, that statute states the following: \"Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, \nknowingly and willfully-(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes \nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or \ndocument knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry [is guilty of an \noffense). The full language of the statute is also available here. \nRegarding the elements required to prove such an offense, pursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, \nInstruction 36-3 (Elements of the Offense), a conviction for this offense require that the following elements each must \nbe proven beyond a reasonable doubt: \nFirst, that on or about the date specified in the indictment, the defendant falsified (or concealed or covered up) a \nmaterial fact; \nSecond, that the fact falsified (or concealed or covered up) was material; \nThird, that defendant did so by trick, scheme or device; \nFourth, that defendant acted knowingly and willfully; and \nFifth, that the falsification, concealment or coverup was with respect to a matter within the jurisdiction of the \ngovernment of the United States (if applicable: or that federal funds were involved). \nYou may note in particular the inclusion of the \"knowingly and willfully\" requirement, as we discussed. \nWe also understand that you will send us, to the extent you believe it is relevant or helpful for our consideration, any \nparticular provisions or protections contemplated under the MLAT process, and which of those, if any, you believe are \nrelevant, or should be applicable, to a voluntary interview. \nWe look forward to speaking with you again this coming Monday, August 3, at 4:00 p.m. (LDN time), and we further \nconfirm, as discussed, that our Office is prepared to extend the Negotiation Period, referenced in our email of July 14, \n2020, for two weeks from our call yesterday, to August 10, 2020, under the terms previously mutually agreed upon. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00022204\n\nEFTA00022205",
