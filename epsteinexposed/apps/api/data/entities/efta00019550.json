And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials \nyou received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was \nincluded). \nAnother person on our team, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via \nphone her number is and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. \nthanks again! \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 2019 17:19 \nTo: (IMD) (FBI) \nCc:\n(NY) (FBI) \nc ; \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \n(USANYS) \nFollowing up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact \ninfo — I'm reachable at this email address or by phone at (office) or (cell). Please don't \nhesitate to reach out anytime day or night if we can provide any useful info, or if you have any questions at all, and we \nappreciate you talking with us about the records information. Let us know if it makes sense to set up another call for \nFriday or early next week to check in on the questions we had, and thanks very much for your help. \nthanks again, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00019551",
