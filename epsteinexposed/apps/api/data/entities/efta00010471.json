    "text": "\n\n1 \nRemarks as Pre ared for Delivery by \nAssistant Director in Charge \nFBI New York Field \nOffice \nJeffrey Epstein Arrest \nJuly X, 2019 \nPreserving the innocence of children is the most important \nresponsibility we carry as \nadults. Failing them, in any way, is not an \noption. \nAnd yet there are some who blatantly disregard this golden rule, using \nwhatever tools they have at their \ndisposal to lure children into a life of \nwhich they \nshould never be exposed. \nAs we allege \ntoday, Jeffrey Epstein is one of those people. \nAs of x a.m., \nhe is under arrest.../At X p.m., as he was X, we placed \nhim \nunder arrest. Epstein has been \ncharged with \none count \neach of sex \ntrafficking and sex trafficking \nconspiracy. \nFor at least a \nthree year period, from 2002-2005, he is alleged to have \nsexually exploited and \nabused dozens of minor girls at his homes in \nNew York City and Palm Beach, Florida. \nThe girls were recruited in a \nvariety of ways, \nusually by employees of \nEpstein and victim \nrecruiters themselves. \n•  The victim recruiters and the girls they \nfound typically received \nhundreds of dollars in cash. \nEFTA00010471\n\n2 \nThe \nestimated dozens of victims were as young as 14 years old at the \ntime of recruitment. \n•  Children \nwho were made to give Epstein massages while they \nwere nude or \npartially nude. \n• \nChildren who were asked to engage in direct and indirect sex acts \nfor \nmoney. \n•  Children who were enticed to do all of this at the hands of a man \nmore than or nearly three times their age. \nThose who have been victimized \nby child sexual predators are \nfrequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into adulthood, \nand often for the rest of their lives. They bear the \nburden of someone \nelse's \ncriminal behavior. \nAs an FBI agent, and as a father first, I stand among many who make \nit our mission to put child \npredators behind bars where they belong; to \nlisten to \nevery child who feels they've been exploited; and to advocate \nfor the most vulnerable \namong us. \nToday I'm asking \neveryone to take a good look at this man. If you've \nbeen victimized by him in any way, or have any additional information \nabout \nhis alleged illegal behavior, we want to hear from you. \n•  Whatever age you are now \n•  Whatever age you were then \n•  And no matter when or where the incident or \nincidents took place \nThe number to call is 1-800-CALL-FBI. \nEFTA00010472\n\n3 \nYour bravery \nmight just empower others to speak out about crimes \ncommitted against them. \nIt's important to remember, there never was, nor will there ever be, an \nexcuse for \nthis kind behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victim always \ncomes \nfirst. \nMany \nthanks, as always, to our partners from the Southern District of \nNew York. Last but not least, I extend my sincere \ncongratulations to \nthe FBI's Criminal Division in New York for their hard work on this \ninvestigation. \nEFTA00010473",
