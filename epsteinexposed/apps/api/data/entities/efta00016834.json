Maybe tomorrow? I have time in the afternoon. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday January 31, 2020 1:09 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Epstein -- travel approval form \nTotally understand, and next week would be fine — let me know if it's helpful to set a time, and otherwise I'll touch base \nmidweek if we haven't connected by then. \nAnd thanks very much re: the memo. \nFrom: \nSent: Lday, January 31, 2020 12:53 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein -- travel approval form \nAlready signed and sent upstairs . . . .

Thank you! \nEFTA00016834\n\nAnd separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if that's \neasier. \nthanks again, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00016835",
