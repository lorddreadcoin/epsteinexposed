If we do issue something in response, as you'll see, I would recommend we keep it \nshort and forward looking, rather than trying to rehash all of the various factual inaccuracies in his account of the \npast. \nToday, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely publicly portray himself as eager and willing to cooperate with an \nongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his \nassociates, despite the fact that the Prince has never sat for an interview with federal authorities, has repeatedly \ndeclined our request to schedule such an interview, and several months ago informed us unequivocally —through the \nvery same counsel who issued today's release -- that he would not come in for such an interview. If Prince Andrew is, \nin fact, serious about cooperating with a federal investigation, our doors have always been open, and we await word of \nwhen we should expect him. \nEFTA00028561",
