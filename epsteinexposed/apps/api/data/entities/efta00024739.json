Any information you could provide would be very \nhelpful. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Monday, October 19, 2020 6:34 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \nHi =, \nHope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up \nwith you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in \nthe boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached \nfile —  which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, \nwe have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials \nyou sent. \nThanks very much, \nFrom \nSent: Wednesday, February 13, 2019 9:53 AM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \nEpstein investigation \nHi \nWanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to \ntransmit the scanned records t. but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we \nlast spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials you \nreceived were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was \nincluded). \nAnother person on our team, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via \nphone her number and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. \nthanks again! \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, January 30, 2019 17:19 \nTo: \nCc \nSubject: RE: Epstein investigation \nEFTA00024739\n\nFollowing up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact \ninfo — I'm reachable at this email address or by phone at (office) o. (cell). Please don't \nhesitate to reach out anytime day or night if we can provide any useful info, or if you have any questions at all, and we \nappreciate you talking with us about the records information. Let us know if it makes sense to set up another call for \nFriday or early next week to check in on the questions we had, and thanks very much for your help. \nthanks again, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00024740",
