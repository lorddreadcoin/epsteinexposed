Epstein allegedly \nworked with several employees and associates to ensure that he had a steady supply of \nminor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims themselves to recruit other \nunderage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. The indictment against Jeffrey \nEpstein was vacated following his death in August of 2019. \n• \n• \n• \nEFTA00028467",
