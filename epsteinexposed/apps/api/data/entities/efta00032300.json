He might be \nuseful in your enquiries. \nJon Wedger email numnut2009@hotmail.co.uk \nHere is an interview that he gave recently: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9TscJsVKp4\nProcurer of children, Jimmy Savile, was on very close terms with royalty and politicians. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65p8J-WQbKI \nThe British establishment pushed Chief Constable, Mike Veale, out of his job because he was doing \nan honest investigation into Jimmy Savile and his high level connections. Mr. Veale felt the need to \nmake a public statement, but he was still kicked out for doing his job. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtWVtH8AuA4 \nJimmy Savile was protected by the British government for almost 50 years, and was even sent on \n'ambassadorial' missions to Israel. Why? He was a third rate entertainer and no more. He spent 11 \nChristmases as the guest of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at her country residence, Chequers. He \nwas a frequent guest at Buckingham Palace and, in one public interview, bragged that he had \nsmuggled a small female child into the palace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM \nRIWkE52w \nYours sincerely, \nJean James \nEFTA00032300",
