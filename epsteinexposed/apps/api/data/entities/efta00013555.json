Additionally, we \nhave reviewed an \nextensive set of materials provided by the \nU.S. Attorney's Office and conferred with a number of \nhighly experienced Department attorneys about this matter. The Deputy Attorney General has \nalso been briefed. \nAs you know, the Department of Justice vests considerable discretion in its U.S. Attorneys, and \nthe Deputy Attorney General will intervene in only the most unusual of circumstances. We do \nnot believe such intervention is warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgment for \nthat of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution of this case is appropriate. \nMoreover, having reviewed your \nallegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and the facts \nunderlying \nthem, we see nothing in the conduct of the U.S. Attorney's Office that gives us any \nreason to alter our opinion. \nSincerely, \nItm \nSenior Associate Deputy Attorney General \ncc: \nAlex Acosta \nEFTA00013555",
