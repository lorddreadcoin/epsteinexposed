Several hundred thousand dollars of that \namount was taken out, and ultimately received over $2 million. • used the money \nto buy a new home for her family, a car, to pay off fines to get her license back, and to set \nman account for her children. \n• has had trouble sleeping over the past few months because she has dreams about \nEpstein and is nervous about testifying at trial. U continues to speak with her counselor \nevery day and is prescribed medications to help with her mental health and addiction. \n• • believes she lied to about her age when they were dating.
