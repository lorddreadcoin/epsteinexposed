She will call again today.= is out for two weeks starting \nFriday, which limits the ability for approaches, and I asked them to consider an approach tomorrow, not sure if they'll be \nable to do that. Will let you know if I hear anything. \nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Monday, June 3, 2019 10:01 AM \nTo: (USANYS) < \nSubject: Re: \n> \nGo ahead and give them a  call this morning if you want — I'll be in later but don't wait on me. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Jun 3, 2019, at 09:58, (USANYS) wrote: \nHope you had a great trip!

(It's our understanding that she's not currently represented, though of course if she wants to have \ncounsel, as with everyone else, she can obtain an attorney or we can also assist in getting her appointed counsel. And \nalso similarly, we can jump on a call with her to explain the basics too if that's helpful, but also happy to just have you \nguys make initial contact and then us meet her in person.) \nSo it's fine to call her, and she should know that we have an investigation and that we were planning to be in touch, \nthough as always we're playing a game of telephone on our end so hard to know for sure. If you're able to make contact \nwith her, I think it would make sense to explain what's happening generally but hopefully see if we can go out to \nCalifornia to meet with her sometime this month. \nQuick background on her \nHappy to chat further if that's useful, otherwise green light to give her a call. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00029451",
