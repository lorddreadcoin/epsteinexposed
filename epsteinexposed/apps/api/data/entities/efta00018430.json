I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. \nI apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. \nRegardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 \nyears and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. \nThanks, \nJeff \nJeffrey L.

In \nreviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you \nplease confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for \nany students at Interlochen? \nOur team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful.
