Although the Government believes that Examiner testimony will not require \nadmission through Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Government nevertheless \nprovides notice f Examiner anticipated testimony in an abundance of caution. A copy \nof Examiner curriculum vitae is being produced to you today bearing Bates number 3503-\n001.' \nThe Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner will testify about \nhis extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search warrants; user information \nassociated with certain of those devices; and documents and photographs extracted from certain \n'  Examiner has previously testified regarding similar topics in federal court.

Hirst, 15 Cr. 643 (PKC), United \nStates v. Stash', 18 Cr. 259 (PKC), and United States v. Kelly, 19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.). \nEFTA00019459\n\nPage 2 \nof those devices. The Government further anticipates that Examiner will also testify that \nsome of the devices on which he performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had \npreviously been performed by someone else. \nThe Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly \nprovide notice if the Government elects to do so. \nRequest for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice \nThe Government reiterates its April 23, 2021 request for reciprocal notice under Rule \n16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert witness that the \ndefendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that the defendant \nintends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the \nwitness's qualifications. \nAdditionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery \nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: \n(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or \ncopies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which \nthe defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or \nreports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in \nconnection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, \nand which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which \nwere prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior \nstatements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses.
