FYI —  I called Ms. attorney (who is paid for by Epstein) and asked \none thing only —  Do you still represent Ms. and do you want me to send the victim notification letter to \nyou or to her? He asked me to send it to him. He asked what the letter would say and I would not tell him. I \nonly said that we anticipated sending out the letter in the next week or so. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nEFTA00013765",
