So the \nfirst thing that I \nthink we \nshould address, sounds like it might be a brief \nconversation, \nis the \nCurcio \nissue I had alerted the government \nthat there is -- a \nCurcio \nissue has arisen. I had appointed \nMs. \nSternheim to \nbe \nCurcio \ncounsel. She's here. \nMS. STERNHEIM: \nYes. \nTHE COURT: But my \nunderstanding -- Ms. Sternheim, \nyou'll let me know if I'm \nwrong about this -- that we're not \nyet ready to address all the issues. I know you've been \nworking diligently on it, \nbut we're not quite done; is that \nright? \nMS. STERNHEIM: That is \ncorrect, Judge. And I can \ncontact the parties and your Honor as to a schedule if that is \nhelpful, but I do not have that in place. \nTHE COURT: \nOkay. That's fine. That sounds like a \ngood suggestion, and we can go from there. So \nI'll thank you \nagain for taking on this assignment. I thank you for being \nhere today and for the update. \nThe next \nissue, I think it makes sense to address, is \nthis question of sealing the correspondence with regard to \nprison conditions, prison \ndesignation and then I think we have \nto resolve the issue of Mr. Tartaglione's housing. So I've \nread all the letters. \nI don't \nknow, Ms. if you want to add anything. \nEFTA00017109\n\n2 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMS. No, your Honor. \nI have nothing to add. \nWe'll \nrest on our papers. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nAnd I take it that counsel \nfor Mr. Tartaglione remain \nagnostic on this issue; is that right? \nMR. BARKET: \nYes. \nTHE COURT: Okay. All right. So what we're talking \nabout here is the government's request to seal letters that \nhave been docketed. There have been redacted versions filed, \nbut we're talking about Docket Numbers 150 and 153. \nAnd the background of this is that back on \nAugust 21st there was a conference where we discussed, among \nother things, issues related to Mr. \nTartaglione's housing in \nthe MCC, and what I had asked the government to do is inquire \nabout options for housing Mr. Tartaglione at either the MCC \nor \nMDC because those are the only two Bureau of Prisons \nfacilities \nin the New York \nmetropolitan area. Because it turns out that \nthe \nother facilities, whether they were in Nassau County or \nhere in Westchester County or in other counties, those are not \nfederal facilities and those facilities either didn't have \ncontracts with the Southern District Marshals, or otherwise had \nadvised that they were not going to house Mr. Tartaglione. So \nthe particular question was \nwhether or not MDC would be willing \nto take Mr. \nTartaglione back, and we had had a pretty fulsome \ndiscussion about the issues that had led to Mr. Tartaglione's \nEFTA00017110\n\n3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ntransfer from \nMDC to MCC. \nThe government \nfollowed up, as I had asked it to, \nwith a letter dated August 23rd, and that's the letter, the \nfirst letter the government ask be placed under seal that \naddressed the issue about housing Mr. Tartaglione at \nMDC and \nMCC, and the government, as I said, asked that the letter be \nsealed. The Court, on August 26th, temporarily \nfiled it under \nseal, but then asked the government to \nfurther explain its \nreasons for permanently sealing that letter. \nOn August 28th, counsel for Mr. \nTartaglione filed a \nletter which addressed the merits of the government's housing \noptions as presented in the August 23rd letter and counsel had \nasked that that letter be filed under seal because it was \nresponsive to the government's letter which had been \nfiled \nunder seal. \nOn August 29th, the government filed a \nletter arguing \nthat its August 23rd letter or at least a portion of it should \nne filed under seal because it addressed Bureau of Prisons' \nreasoning for either why it was \nthat certain things had been \nconsidered and certain steps that the Bureau of Prisons thought \nwould be necessary to house Mr. Tartaglione, and also the \ngovernment filed a letter stating that the August 28th letter \nshould remain under seal, that is, \ncounsel for Mr. Tartaglione. \nOn September 5th, the New York \nPost and the New York \nDaily \nNews \nfiled a letter \narguing for the \nunsealing of the \nEFTA00017111\n\n4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nletters. \nThey \nwere joined by \nthe \nNew \nYork \nTimes \non \nSeptember \n10th. \nThe \ngovernment, as the Court had previously asked, \nhad submitted a response to I \nguess the first letter from The \nPost \nand \nthe \nDaily \nNews \nexplaining why and really reiterating \nits argument for sealing and that's when counsel for \nMr. Tartaglione \nannounced their agnosticism on the issue. \nSo the question actually has a couple of layers to \nit. So the first question is whether or not the government's \nletters are considered judicial documents. And a judicial \ndocument is an item that is, \"relevant to the performance of \nthe \njudicial function and useful in the judicial process,\" and \nthat's from the Second Circuit's \ndecision in Bernstein v \nBernstein \nLitowitz Berger & \nGrossmann LLP, \n814 \nF.3d 132, 139, \nquoting from an \nearlier Second Circuit's decision in a case \ncalled \nLugosch \nv Pyramid Company of \nOnondaga, \n435 \nF.3d 110, \n119. The mere filing, however, of anything, \nwhether it's some \nkind of a document or a letter with the court by itself doesn't \nrender such a document a judicial document. That's from the \nSecond \nCircuit's decision \nin \nUS versus Amodeo, \n44 F.3d 141, \n145. But if an \nitem is a judicial document, then the public \nhas a presumptive right of access to it under both the common \nlaw and the First Amendment. \nAlso from Amodeo. The purpose of \nthis right \nis to ensure that courts are held accountable and \nthat the public has \"confidence in the \nadministration of \nEFTA00017112\n\n5 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \njustice.\" \nAlso from \nAmodeo. \nUnder the common law analysis, the Court is to \ndetermine the \nweight of the presumption of access. \"Generally, \nthe information will fall somewhere on a \ncontinuum from matters \nthat directly affect an adjudication to matters that come \nwithin \nthe court's purview solely to ensure their irrelevance.\" \nThat's \nfrom the \nsecond \nAmodeo \ncase, 731 F.3d at 1049. \n\"Finally, after determining the \nweight of the \npresumption of access, the Court must 'balance competing \nconsiderations \nagainst it.\n'\" \nLugosch \nat page 120. \nCompeting considerations include both \"the danger of \nimpairing law enforcement or \njudicial efficiency,\" or \"the \nprivacy of interests of those resisting disclosure.\" \nThe first Amendment analysis \nrequires two different \napproaches. The first considers \"experience and logic,\" that \nis, \"whether the documents have historically been open to the \npress and general public\" and \"whether public access plays a \nsignificant and positive role in \nthe function of the particular \nprocess in question.\" That's from \nBernstein at page 141. \nThe second approach which applies when \nthe judicial \nproceedings themselves are covered by the First \nAmendment \nconsiders whether the documents are \"derived from or a \nnecessary corollary of the capacity to attend the relevant \nproceedings.\" That's from Lugosch at 120. \nUnder either approach, the moving party has to \nEFTA00017113\n\n6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ndemonstrate that sealing is \"essential to \npreserve higher \nvalues and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" \nBernstein at 134. Further, the Court has to make \"specific, \non-the-record findings...demonstrating that closure is \nessential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to \nserve that \ninterest.\" \nLugosch \nat \n120. \nSo the Government's argument is that the August 23rd \nletter, in the first \ninstance, is that the August 23rd letter \ndoesn't qualify as a judicial document because it has no \nbearing on the charges \ncontained in the pending indictment\" and \n\"the location where [Mr. Tartaglione] is to be detained pending \ntrial is ancillary to this \ncriminal prosecution.\" So in the \nGovernment's view, \nits August 23rd letter is status report \nabout the BOP's \"internal deliberations.\" \nThe \ngovernment argues in the alternative that even if \nit is a judicial document, that redacting \ncertain information, \nincluding most \nspecifically BOP's explanation of \nMr. Tartaglione's \nhousing options, is appropriate. And that's \nbecause, according to the government \"the BOP \nmaintains that \nthe \npublic filing of those paragraphs would jeopardize its law \nenforcement functions and \ninappropriately hamper its interim \ndeliberative processes.\" I guess the \nSOP \nis arguing that any \npresumption of access is overcome because the letter also, to \nthe extent it's even a judicial document, it still addresses \nwhat BOP considers an \nancillary matter. And so a public filing \nEFTA00017114\n\n7 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwould \"hinder \nthe internal deliberative process of the MDC and \nthereby jeopardies the BOP's ability to carry out its function \nof securing pretrial defendants,\" because the letter provides \ndetails that were \"taken into account to make an appropriate \nhousing decision for a defendant charged \nwith multiple \nmurders.\" Also, the assertion is the \npublic filing of the \ndocument, the letter, would \"risk \ncircumvention of the law\" \nbecause \"the public revelation of internal \ndeliberations\" would \n\"enable all inmates to alter their behavior and manipulate \ntheir housing assignments to cause harm to others or engage in \nillicit \nbehavior.\" \nThe \naforementioned media organizations argue that the \nletter, the letter of August 23rd, is a judicial document \nbecause it was submitted to the Court for purposes seeking or \nopposing an adjudication, and also that there's significant \npublic interest in the \nconditions in BOP facilities, and \nfinally the conditions of Mr. \nTartaglione's confinement are \nrelative to his case and his rights. \nSo addressing the threshold question about whether \nthe August 23rd and August 28th letters are judicial documents, \nthe Court concludes that they are. While the letters \nthemselves may not directly address the actual charges filed \nagainst Mr. Tartaglione, that is not the governing standard. \nThe correct standard I've already mentioned is broader than \nthat, and therefore, in my view, the letters are \"relevant to \nEFTA00017115\n\n8 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe performance of a judicial function and useful in a judicial \nprocess.\" First of all, the letters were filed in response to \na court order. So calling them a nonjudicial document seems \nanomalous as they were directed as part of the judiciary's \noverseeing of this case. \nSecond, the letter is related to an issue, that is, \nMr. Tartaglione's \nconditions of confinement, that could \nsubstantially \nimpact his ability to mount a defense and thus \nare directly related \nto his trial rights, his constitutional \nrights, among other things, to \ndefend himself. \nIndeed, the housing issue has been repeatedly raised \nby counsel for \nMr. Tartaglione precisely on that ground, and I \nthink \nunderstandably so, and so the relevance of the letters \nfollows from the relevance of Mr. \nTartaglione's conditions, and \nof \ncourse it's not irrelevant that this is a capital case. \nThe \nproof of that is that the issues that are \naddressed in the letters have been addressed here in open court \nreally from the very first \ntime that these issues have been \nraised. \nSo put it in the language of the Second Circuit, the \nspecific contents of the letters are \"relevant to the nature of \nthe \nproceeding,\" that is, how Mr. Tartaglione is being housed \nin connection with his ability to defend himself in this \ncapital case. And I \nthink it certainly is the case that \naccess, public access to the letters \"would materially assist \nEFTA00017116\n\n9 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nin the public's understanding of these housing issues before \nthe Court in evaluating the fairness and integrity of the \nCourt's proceedings.\" That's from Second Circuit's decision \nin \nNewsday LLC County of Nassau, \n730 F.3d 156, 166-67. And of \ncourse all this, in the Court's view, is consistent \nwith \nholding those \nof us in the criminal justice system accountable \nfor what \nit is we do. \nSo given the letters are judicial documents, the \nCourt proceeds to consider the weight of the \npresumption of \naccess and whether any competing interest overcomes the weight \nof access such that portions of the letters may be redacted. \nThere is, I \nthink, at the outset a waiver issue, \nbecause a lot of even the deliberative process of the MDC has \nbeen discussed before. So, for example, some of the \ndisciplinary issues \nthat Mr. Tartaglione had they have been \ndiscussed. There's been a great deal of \ndiscussion involving \nconversation \nwith counsel for MCC \nall the \nvarious things MCC \nhas had 20 do to accommodate Mr. Tartaglione's concerns, and \nthere's been a great deal of discussion, \nconversations for Mr. \nTartaglione and MCC \nfor the government \nand MCC officials, but \nweight of the \npresumptive right of access \nfor \nexample, about \nofficials and counsel \nin any \nevent, the \nhere is heavy. This \nis a capital case. Given the obvious stakes involved, the \npublic has a deep interest in ensuring judicial accountability \nin all aspects of the case, including adjudicating any \nEFTA00017117\n\n10 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ngrievances related to pretrial confinement that might affect \nMr. Tartaglione's \nability to defend himself in the case. Of \ncourse that goes to the very fairness of the \nproceedings. Also \nthe public has an interest in the \nconditions of confinement in \nBOP facilities in general. \nAnything that would suggest to the \ncontrary would be \nKafkaesque. And Mr. Tartaglione's conditions \nin particular, and in ensuring that BOP's decision-making on \ninmate housing is reasonable seems to me precisely the kind of \nthing that should be accessible to the public. So I think \nBOP's argument in \nthat regard falters. \nTo the extent BOP is arguing that its deliberative \nprocess in this case satisfies the sort of \ncompelling interest \nthat could justify sealing the portions of the letters that it \nwants sealed, it bears noting that the parties seeking sealing \nthat wants to overcome this presumption has to show that \nsealing will further a \ncompelling interest, such as a law \nenforcement concern, a national security concern, a public \nsafety concern. \nObviously privilege is certainly a valid \nconcern, as are \nprivacy interests. And the burden, of course, \nis on BOP to make that showing. But I don't think SOP has done \nthat here. The deliberative processes that BOP is talking \nabout are not protocols, for example, that it never \npublicizes \nas to how it is that it might secure inmates at a facility. \nThat would be different. That could very well be a situation \nwhere disclosure of how BOP addresses specific security \nEFTA00017118\n\n11 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nconcerns could alert \nand put not \nonly BOP \nat \nrisk. That's not \npeople to then circumvent those concerns \nofficials at risk but also other inmates \nwhat \nwe're talking about here. We're \ntalking about the deliberative process that BOP says it engaged \nin in evaluating \nwhere to house Mr. \nTartaglione and how in \nparticular it would do so at MDC and MCC. \nSo, for example, to the extent that Bureau of Prisons \n:as some concerns about housing Mr. \nTartaglione in the general \nhousing and \nexplains why, a lot of the things that letters that \nthe BOP had the government put in its letter are things that \npeople know. So the fact that Mr. Tartaglione is \nfacing the \ndeath penalty, the fact that he used to be in law enforcement, \nthe fact that there's been this whole public scrutiny \nover what \nhappened with Mr. Epstein and Mr. Tartaglione being involved in \nthat, these are things that are commonly known. So to the \nextent that the BOP took factors that were \ncommonly known into \nits so-called deliberative process in evaluating how it is that \nhe could be housed at the two facilities, including, \nby the \nway, the fact that there have been prior disciplinary issues, \nthat's also been publically discussed here in Court, and it's \nbeen the subject of letters. So the \ncellphone thing, for \nexample, and other \nprior disciplinary issues, that's all been \npublicly discussed, and to the extent BOP took all those things \ninto consideration, I think it's hard for BOP to argue that \ntaking into consideration factors that were publicly \nknown \nEFTA00017119\n\n12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nabout how it is best to house Mr. Tartaglione is the type of \ndiscussion of security protocols that otherwise aren't public. \nSo I think \nit distinguishes between what BOP has done here and \nwhat it maybe does in coming up with very specific protocols, \neither as to a particular individual or as to how it is it \nhouses people generally at its \nfacilities. \nSo I just don't see how unsealing the letters and \nrevealing the deliberative process is something that's going to \nuniquely publicize certain things that are going to jeopardize \nBOP officials or other \ninmates. For example, to the extent BOP \nargues a disclosure could lead to bad behavior, that inmates \ncould manipulate their housing assignments, I just don't see \nthat here. \nThere are certain things about Mr. Tartaglione that \nhe has no control over. He has no control over the fact \nthat -- in terms of things he can change. He was a law \nenforcement officer. The fact that BOP took that \nconsideration, I don't see how somebody can manipulate that to \nsomehow pretend that, for example, they weren't a \nlaw \nenforcement officer. You can't change your history. So I just \ndon't understand how that's going to somehow lead to \ncircumvention of security protocols. \nSo I just don't think BOP has made the case that the \npublic disclosure is going to risk \nharming anybody, and so give \ngiven the BOP'S, in my view, failure to \nestablish a compelling \nEFTA00017120\n\n13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ninterest to overcome the presumption of public access, I'm \ngoing to order the letters be unsealed. \nIf \nBOP wants to have you go to the Second Circuit, \ncan you let me know. I mean, \nI'll wait a day, Ms. if \nthey're that concerned, but you'll let me know by the end of \nbusiness tomorrow? \nMS. COMEY: Yes, your \nHonor. \nthe ocurt: Okay, thank you. \nAll right, any updates \nfrom the government? \nMS. \nYour Honor, we \nremain in the same place \nwe were last time, the government is ready for trial. We would \nask the Court to set a trial date. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nMr. \nBarket. \nMR. BARKET: Well, I mean, \nbefore I get to the trial \ndate part, we actually have something to say about that today. \nTHE \nCOURT: Yes. \nMR. BARKET: I'm curious \nabout the issue concerning \nthe telephone which has been \nstewing for some while. \nMS. \nThe government will \nnot be seeking a \nwarrant for \nthat phone. \nTHE \nCOURT: Okay. \nMR. BARKET: I guess, \nless work. \nOn the issue of the trial date, we have had some \ndiscussions among counsel as to laying out what we \nthink is a \nEFTA00017121\n\n14 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nreasonable schedule among us. \nWe've had a preliminary \nconversation \nabout it with Mr. Tartaglione. We are still in \nthe process of kind of finalizing that. So what I'm going to \nsuggest to the Court is that you allow that process to continue \ninternally, \nand that before the next Court date we'll have \ncompleted it, met \nwith the government, proposed it to them and \nhopefully gotten \ntheir agreement on it and then we can come \nback with a joint \nscheduling order all the way through to the \ntrial. \n(End of \nexcerpt) \nEFTA00017122",
