GOLDBERGER, ESQUIRE \nSTATE OF FLORIDA \n) SS \nCOUNTY OF PALM BEACH ) \nBEFORE ME, the \nundersigned authority, personally \nappeared \nhaving personal knowledge and being \nduly sworn, deposes and says: \n1. \nI, Jack A. Goldberger, have \npersonal knowledge of the \nmatters set \nforth herein. I  am an attorney licensed to \npractice in the State of Florida since \n1978. I \nam a  partner with the law firm of Atterbury \nGoldberger & Weiss, P.A., \nlocated at One Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400, 250 Australian Avenue \nSouth, West \nPalm Beach, FL \n33401. \n2. My \npractice includes and specializes in the \ndefense of criminal \nmatters. I am board certified in criminal law. I  have \nbeen and currently am the \ncriminal defense attorney for JEFFREY EPSTEIN. \n3. I represented Mr. \nEPSTEIN in the negotiation of and entering into a \nNon-Prosecution Agreement with \nthe United States Attorney's Office \n(USAO) for \nthe Federal Southern District of \nFlorida. The terms and conditions of \nthe Non-\nProsecution Agreement also entailed \nthe entering of a Plea Agreement with the \nState Attorney's Office, Palm Beach County, State \nof Florida. (The Non-\nProsecution Agreement shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"NPA\"). \n4. By its terms, the NPA took effect on \nJune 30, 2008. Also, pursuant \nto the terms of the NPA, any criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN is deferred \nas long as the terms and conditions of the NPA are fulfilled by EPSTEIN. \nEXHIBITT \nEFTA00013850\n\nCase \n9:08-cv-80119-KAM \nDocument 65-3 \nEntered on FLSD \nDocket 03/25/2009 \nPage 2 of 3 \n5. The criminal \nmatters against EPSTEIN remain ongoing \nuntil the \nNPA expires by \nits terms in late 2010 and as long as the \nUSAO determines \nEPSTEIN has complied with those terms \nand conditions. The threat of criminal \nprosecution against \nEPSTEIN by USAO in the Southern District of Florida \ncontinues presently and through late 2010. \n6. Pursuant to the terms of the \nNPA, the USAO possesses the right to \ndeclare that the agreement has been breached, give \nEPSTEIN's counsel notice, \nand attempt to move \nforward with a prosecution. As of the date of this Affidavit, \nthe USAO has taken the position on a number \nof occasions that it might consider \nthe following actions by EPSTEIN \nto be a breach of the NPA. \n• \nInvestigation by EPSTEIN (by and \nthrough his attorneys) of this Plaintiff \nand the other Plaintiffs in other pending civil cases \nfor purposes of \ndefending the civil \nactions; \n• \nEPSTEIN's contesting damages in this action and other civil actions. \n• EPSTEIN or his legal \nrepresentatives making statements to the press \nabout \nthis Plaintiff or the other Plaintiffs. \n• Using the word \"jail\" instead of \"imprisonment\" in the plea agreement with \nthe Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. \n7. EPSTEIN, through counsel, submitted a  Freedom of Information \nAct request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) for documents relating to \nthis and the other cases; the FBI denied the \nrequest stating the materials are at \nthis time exempt from disclosure because they are in an investigative file, i.e. the \nmatter is still an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation. \nPage - 2 - \nEFTA00013851\n\nCase 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 65-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009 Page 3 of 3 \n8.
