Most of my VOC stuff is on the 4th floor. Most of my MLOC stuff is electronic so there shouldn't be \nmuch to look through. When you are there happy to join on FT to help out. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct 26, 2020, at 6:24 PM, wrote: \nThanks very much.

More specifically, can \nyou check to see whether you have any case materials at all (of any type) that are not on the shared (e.g. in emails, or \nsaved locally)? \nThanks, \n•c> \nEFTA00028479",
