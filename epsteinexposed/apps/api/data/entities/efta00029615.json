For example, you may be working on a  case that involves ABC Corp.; and even though the case \nwould not create a  conflict for you, if anybody in your line of supervision owns more than de minimis ABC \nCorp. stock, that supervisor will have a conflict and we need to keep the case away from him or her. \nAttached is a list of your cases and a list of the entities—corporations and law firms—that may create a conflict \nfor one of your supervisors. There is one list for the Crim Div and one list for the Civ Div. \nIf any of your cases involves one of those entities (other than routine subpoenas to banks and service providers), \nplease (using Adobe's Add Text functionality) type in the Asset ID code(s) for the pertinent entity(ies). Save and \nreturn the form to me. \nNegative responses are required. \nParalegal Specialist — Criminal Division \nUnited States Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00029615",
