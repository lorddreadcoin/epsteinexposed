Because of \nthe sensitive nature of these cases, it's critical that we don't let cases linger, and, in consultation with your supervisors, we \nclose cases when necessary. \nPlease review the attached list, noting the most recent entry for any case under your name. Then... \n• If the case is uncharged, please advise me of the status of any expected charges and/or come by to discuss next \nsteps. \n• If the case has been charged, please send me a quick email with any updates to the case status (e.g., pled, \nsentenced, on appeal) or, if the status is up to date, please confirm that no changes need to be made. \nThanks in advance for your prompt reply to this email. (Read: Please don't make me hunt you down for updates —  this will \ntake approximately 5 minutes.) \nThanks, \nEFTA00030789",
