Sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you \nhave further questions regarding your travel voucher for this trip. \nsuotect: at: rinai voucner iu2f1U414μ1preparea ay a travel arranger is pending your review \nAlex, regarding the Transient Occupancy Tax, LA County is tax exempt. I've contacted Doubletree by Hilton Santa Monica \nfor a  refund for those charges. Thanks for your patience in this matter. \nSubject: RE: Final Voucher 10810414(1) prepared by a travel arranger is pending your review \nUnfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 —  see the \ninvoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I'm supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily \nallowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax. \nPlease let me know when it is corrected and I will review it again. \nFrom: etravelservices@cwtsatotravel.com \nSent: Wednesday, November 20, 2019 10:06 \nSubject: Final Voucher 10810414(1) prepared by a travel arranger is pending your review \nEFTA00025248\n\nDear \nFinal voucher 10810414(1) has been prepared by your travel arranger and is ready for your review.
