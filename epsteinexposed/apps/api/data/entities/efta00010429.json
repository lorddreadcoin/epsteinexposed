We can circulate a  dial in and look forward to \ntalking further then. \nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nCc: \n[Contractor] \nSubject: RE: SDFL Epstein-related documents \nHellos \n(USANYS)< \n>; \n(USANYS) \nla\nUSANYS) \nI can do a call this afternoon. Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow \nduring the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don't \nwork, let me know and we will work out an alternate time. \nIn the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case \nfiles and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR \nhas their own inventory of the materials. \nWhen OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the \ndocuments that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the \ntime on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well. \nA copy of our inventory is attached. \nI look forward to assisting you in this matter. \nEFTA00010429\n\nBest regards, \nManaging ssistant nited States Attorney \nWest Palm Beach Regional Office —  SDFL \nFrom: (USANYS) \nSent: Tuesday, August 25, 2020 9:00 AM \nTo: \nCc \nws\n[Contractor] \nSubject: SDFL Epstein-related documents \n(USANYS) \nWe supervise the team in New York that is currently prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell, an uggested \nwe reach out to you.

Please let us know if you have time for a call in the near future to discuss further. \nAlternatively, if there is a more appropriate point of contact on this issue, please feel free to point us in that direction. \nThanks very much, \nChief, Public Corruption Unit \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of  New York \nEFTA00010430",
