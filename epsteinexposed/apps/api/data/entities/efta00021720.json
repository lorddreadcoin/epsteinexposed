It sounds like this went very well. We are in the process of drafting an MLA \nrequest and will get it to you ASAP. I can reach out to the lawyer for the two adult witnesses to inquire about their \nopenness to speaking with the French. Asking the French to propose search terms sounds like a good next step as well. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: (CRM) \nSent: Thursday, January 7, 20215:17 PM \nTo: (USANYS) (USANYS) \n(USANYS) <> \nCc: (CRM) < \nSubject: Brunel \nDear all: \nMy meeting on Brunel went well this afternoon. Here is the quick read out: \nGeneral \nPoints \n•  There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual...and suggests its importance for \nthem. \n•  They can hold Brunel for 18 months initially, but with a neutral judge's approval, can likely keep him for up to 3-4 \nyears while the investigation continues. \n•  They did not flag any known critical points in the near future that would result in press coverage...but you never \nknow what will happen (he will likely ask for release, which would catch some press if so). \n•  Right out of the gate, the lead judge expressed concern about confidentiality (in part because a  long article about \ntheir investigation appeared in a Paris newspaper yesterday). She expressed her expectation that our discussions \nand cooperation would remain confidential. \nU.S. \nSharing  with France \n•  They are interested in your assistance in contacting the lawyer for the two adult victims, to see if the victims would \nbe willing to speak with them. \n•  They are already in touch with lawyer for so no more is needed there. \n•  They are very interested in obtaining records/images from the your database created from the searches of the \nEpstein residences/devices. They are willing to provide search terms, and can work to narrow the range (they are \ninterested to know how to best formulate search terms to take advantage of the platform the records are on (i.e, \ncan they do proximity searches, is facial recognition available to identify Brunel, etc.). The idea was also proposed \nof potentially doing a more narrow search now, followed by a potentially more expansive search for relevant data \nafter your trial...when the SDNY/FBI bandwith might increase and confidentiality concerns might be less acute. \n•  In addition to the database, they wonder if there are transcripts or reports of witness interviews that you would be \nwilling to provide, that bear on Brunel. \n•  In the same vein, they were interested to know if Maxwell talked to FBI post-arrest and if she said anything of \npotential interest to them (I told them 1 doubt it, but said I would ask you). \nEFTA00021721\n\n•  In terms of the confidentiality of the records you would produce, they would be put in the file, and available to the \ndefense and civil parties...but they are strict limits to the circumstances in which they would have access to the \ninformation, and it may even be able to be placed under seal...which would apparently not preclude defense \naccess, but would make it very difficult for the defense to access the info. \n•  They are interested to know if you might expand your investigation to other accomplices/co-conspirators. \n•  They might be interested in a direct dialogue with you, but only if it were a useful exercise (they were less \nenthusiastic than I expected about this) \nFrance Sharing  with \nU.S. \n•  They responded positively regarding your interest in connecting with who is represented by counsel. \nThey indicated a willingness to assist on the basis of an MLAT request sent through normal channels. \n•  But here's the important part: they made it quite clear that they are not going to help SDNY unless we show a \ngood faith effort to help them, and begin sending evidence their way. The sharing needs to be reciprocal, in \nother words. \nPath Forward \n•  I'd propose that you draft the MLAT request for and that we get it into translation ASAP. In the \nmeantime, I will invite them to send narrowed search terms, and you can contact the lawyer for the two adult \nvictims...but let me know your thoughts. \nDOJ Attache/Magistrat de liaison americain \nU.S. Embassy, Paris \nOfc. \nMob \n(-\nFrom: \n(USANYS) \nSent: Thursday, January 7, 2021 12:38 AM \nTo: \n(CRM) <\n:2; \n(USANYS) \nCc: \n(CRM) \nSubject: RE: France \nThis looks accurate to me, thanks very much. One point you might want to add regarding our searches is that we also \ngathered a large number of photographs, including photos that feature Brunel.

Thanks in advance for letting me \nknow if you see any errors, omissions, or additions to make: \n3 Ways Dal Can Offer to Help Advance the French Case \n•  Willing to connect French authorities with attorney for \nEFTA00021722\n\n•  DOJ has awareness of two non-French adult victims who were abused in Paris in relation to Epstein; neither allege \nspecific illegal conduct involving Brunel, one of them definitely met Brunel at some point. DOJ is willing to ask their \nlawyer if the victims would be willing to speak with French authorities. \n•  DOJ executed searches at two Epstein residences (in NYC and the USVI), searched devices, and has created a \nsignificant database of data relating to Epstein. If French authorities can provide more targeted search terms, DOJ \nwould be willing to review those results to identify records that can be provided to French authorities regarding \nBrunel. \nInfo to \nObtain from French \n•  Are French authorities targeting others besides Brunel? \n•  What is the anticipated timeline of the investigation/prosecution; and are there any critical steps that would result \nin press attention in the near term (i.e., before summer 2021); \n• \no  Assistance from French in contacting/speaking with her...with awareness that matter is time sensitive given \nupcoming trial; \no  Assistance in obtaining records from French authorities (including prior interviews) pertinent to her; \no  Is she represented by counsel? \no  DOJ available to her/her counsel to discuss how we inform/protect victims and victim information (as part of \ngeneral victim-centric approach to this case). \nDOJ Attache/Magistrat de liaison americain \nU.S. Embassy, \nParis \nOfc. \n(-\nMob. \n(-\nFrom: (CRM) \nSent: Tuesday, January 5, 20219:02 PM \nTo: (USANYS) \n(USANYS) < \nCc: (CRM) \nSubject: France \nHere is our go-by for an outgoing request to France. \n> \nDOJ Attache/Magistrat de liaison americain \nU.S. Embassy, Paris \nOfc.
