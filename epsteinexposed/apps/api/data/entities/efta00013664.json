I reviewed the docket sheets for the 4 pending federal \nsuits (they are all jeff herman suits) and judge marra has issued orders to show cause why default judgments shouldn't be \nentered for all 4. Herman asked for $50 million in each one. Apparently epstein tried to avoid service and ignored the \ndeadline when the complaints were mailed to him (thinking that was ineffective service). All I can say is, so much money, \nso little skill. \nEFTA00013664",
