Our team is available to do Friday at 11:00, and we can host here at our offices, \n=, if that still works for you both (and Jenna if she's able to join). On our end I expect it will be prosecutors \n, and me, and FBI Special Agent \nSeparately, as promised, attached is our form proffer agreement—when we meet with your client we'll add her name and \ncounsel information (and also change all the he / him to she/ her, obviously). Please let me know if any questions on that. \nThanks again, and looking forward to meeting in person on Friday. \nEFTA00030267\n\n Original Message \nFrom: Alex Conlon \nSent: Wednesday, April 03, 2019 15:15 \nTo: \n  <I \nCc: Alexandra Elenowitz-Hess \nSubject: RE: Scheduling a proffer \nHi, \nThanks so much for your email. Fully agree --Jenna is the best. This is for an attorney proffer and if possible, Jenna will \nprobably join us. \nI'm not sure whether legally changed her name, or if I was just given her husband's last name \nher about it tonight. Also happy to ask her about phone numbers for anyone associated with Epstein. \nThanks, \nAlex \nAlex Conlon I Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP \n Original Message \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, April 3, 2019 3:07 PM \nTo: Alex Conlon < \nCc: Alexandra Elenowitz-Hess \nSubject: Re: Scheduling a proffer \n). I'll ask \nThat's great, thanks —  and Jenna is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I \ntake it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking about a meeting with the \nclient. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back in timing, and will also send you a \ncopy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon. \nTwo other quick things —  first, we know your client as but I think you mentioned her name has changed? \nCould you please let me know her current last name? \nAnd second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone \nassociated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. \nPrimarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't need to talk to her \ndirectly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, \nwe can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it. \nthanks, \nOn Apr 3, 2019, at 14:30, Alex Conlon mailto:wrote: \nEFTA00030268\n\nHi there, \nSorry for the delay on our end.
