That'd be very helpful. Much appreciated, \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 1, 202111:08 AM \nSubject: RE: Epstein \nFOIA \nThanks, Yes, we will make the production tomorrow. We anticipate it will take the Times at least a few days to get \nthrough it (although we don't know for sure on that front). We can let you know once we've released it tomorrow if that'd \nbe helpful. \nFrom: \nSent: Thursday, July 1, 202111:06 AM \nSubject: Epstein FOIA \nMorning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. \nShe asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process \nquestions, and I anticipate declining to comment anyway. \nEFTA00029452\n\nDo we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a  hard time hearing during the call, but my \nimpression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks. \nSpokesman \nUnited States Department of Justice \nU.S. Attorney's Office (Southern District of New York \nEFTA00029453",
