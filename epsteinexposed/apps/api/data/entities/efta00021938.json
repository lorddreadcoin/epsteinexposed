She previously waived her right of anonymity at a court hearing attended by \nvictims of Jeffrey Epstein in New York last August and subsequently appeared on the NBC Dateline show. \nCan you or one of your collea ues lease urgently let me know if there are any legal issues that would \nprevent me from naming Ms as a key witness in this case? \nDo prosecutors plan to publicly identify Ms Maxwell's victims at any point? If so, when? \nI can be contacted via email or on . My deadline is 10pm GMT today. \nMany thanks for your time and help. \nBest wishes \nDipesh Gadher \nHome Affairs Correspondent \nThe Sunday Times \nLondon \nSE1 9GF \nTel: \nMob: \n\"Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail\" \nThis e-mail and any attachments are confidential, may be \nlegally privileged and are the property of News Corp UK & Ireland \nLimited on whose systems they were generated.
