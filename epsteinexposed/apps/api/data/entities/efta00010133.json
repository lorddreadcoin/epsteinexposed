This letter is itself designated as \"confidential,\" because it \nincludes information regarding records designated as \"confidential\" under the Protective \nOrder. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials \nmarked with the word \"confidential\" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved \nfor classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this \nproduction under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today \nare marked with the following label: \"SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, \n8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.\" This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective \nOrder that govern today's production. \nAn index of the materials contained in this production is below: \nEFTA00010133\n\nPage 2 \nBates Start \nBates End Summary Description Confidential Designation \nSDNY GM 02767074 SDNY GM 02771980 SDFL Files' Confidential \nThe Government recognizes tha its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly \nproduce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware.
