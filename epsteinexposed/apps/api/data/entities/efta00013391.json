These records were \npreviously withheld due to the ongoing criminal prosecution against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas \nfor falsifying records on the night of Epstein's suicide. As noted in UMR #2021-05-66021, USAO-\nSDNY entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas in May 2021 and as such, \nUSAO-SDNY no longer plans to assert a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. The \nBOP documents the USAO-SDNY plans to release to The New York Times, which will be immediately \navailable for publication by the Times, include: (i) internal BOP memoranda describing the events and \ncircumstances of Epstein's incarceration and suicide, including the numerous failures that allowed \nEpstein the opportunity to kill himself; (ii) Epstein's psychological records from MCC; (iii) the autopsy \nreport prepared by the New York City Office of the Medical Examiner (\"OCME\"); and (iv) internal \nemails within BOP and between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide reflecting \ngenerally a lack of understanding of what had happened. USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts \nat the BOP and DOJ-OIG about the pending release. \nDESCRIPTION: \nOn August 10, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while housed in the Special Housing \nUnit at the MCC. USAO-SDNY is currently defending the BOP in connection with ongoing FOIA \nlitigation filed by The New York Times seeking documents regarding Epstein. Previously, BOP had \nwithheld a number of documents based on the pendency of the criminal prosecution of Tova Noel and \nMichael Thomas, the two guards on duty the night of Epstein's suicide who were accused of falsely \nindicating on BOP forms that they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. As noted \nin UMR # 2021-05-66021, in May 2021 USAO-SDNY entered into deferred prosecution agreements \nwith Noel and Thomas and as such, USAO-SDNY has notified the presiding Judge in the FOIA \nEFTA00013391\n\nlitigation that BOP no longer plans to assert a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. \nAccordingly, pursuant to Court-ordered deadlines in the FOIA litigation, the USAO-SDNY must \nproduce the previously-withheld documents, which number approximately 2,700 pages, by July 2, \n2021 to The New York Times, who will then be free to publish those materials. \nThe materials primarily consist of internal BOP memoranda, reports, emails, and documents, as well \nas emails with USAO-SDNY, as well as the autopsy report prepared by OCME. As noted above, the \ndocuments include the following topics and materials: (i) internal BOP memoranda from the day and \nnight of Epstein's suicide; (ii) a photograph of a sign that was hung in the Special Housing Unit that \nstated that rounds on Epstein were mandatory, signed \"God,\" which had been defaced to include a \nquestion mark after \"mandatory\"; (iii) Epstein's psychological records at MCC, which generally show \nthat he claimed not to be suicidal, attempted to manipulate staff, and received some special treatment \nat MCC; (iv) internal BOP memoranda evaluating the circumstances and failures that led to the \nconditions in which Epstein could kill himself, including the failure to reassign a cellmate, to perform \ncounts or rounds, to ensure adequate staffing at MCC, and other failures at the institution; (v) emails \nwithin BOP and between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide which show efforts \nto find out what was happening at MCC and frustration that MCC was not providing information; (vi) \nemails showing that Main Justice took an interest following Epstein's suicide, and sent individuals to \ntour MCC; and (vii) the OCME autopsy report concluding that Epstein committed suicide by hanging. \nPursuant to established case law, BOP plans to redact photographs of Epstein's corpse and \nphotographs from the autopsy, as well as the names of AUSAs and lower-level BOP staff members. \nAs noted above, USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts at the BOP and DOJ-OIG regarding this \npending release. \nReport ID: 2021-06-67383 \nFor Official Use Only \n(FOUO): \nThe term used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sensitive \nnature, not otherwise categorized by statute or regulation, the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely \nimpact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential \nto the national interest.
