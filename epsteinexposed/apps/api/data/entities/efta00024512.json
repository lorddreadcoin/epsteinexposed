    "text": "\n\nFrom: \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: JE estate meeting \nDate: Tue, 31 Dec 2019 03:25:43 +0000 \nFollowing up on your request for a meeting, I think due to various holiday-related issues we don't yet have a response for \nyou, and wanted to provide that status given the approach of the dates you had initially mentioned as being possible. It's \nour hope that once everyone in our office is back and settled next week we'll be able to circle back to you with more \ninformation. We remain very aware of the ongoing processes on the estate / trustees side and we'll work to a response to \nyou as soon as possible. \nthanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, December 20, 2019 17:17 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: JE estate meeting \nWe're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct \ncriminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search \nwarrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's \ncriminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USA0_4381-4445, but \npotentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a \nprotective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of the \nsearch warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and I \nhope this is useful in the interim. \nSeparately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential \nforfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide \nthese dates in connection with your request). \nthanks, \na \nFrom: \nSent: Thursda December 19, 2019 19:09 \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: JE estate meeting \nEFTA00024512\n\nTo follow up on our call, can you please send us the search warrant returns/inventories and, if possible, any additional \ndetail regarding the items that were seized in the two searches of the New York property and the search of the New \nMexico property. \nWith respect to a next meeting with you and the Chief of the Criminal Division and, of course, any other colleagues you \nwish to attend, the following dates in early January would be good for us: \nJanuary 3, 6 (before 2:00), 7, 8 (1:00 or later), 9 (after 11:00), or 10 \nHappy and Healthy New Year from and me. \n  Partner \nuo-Cnair. \nWhite Collar Defense \nHu hes \nHubbard & Reed LLP \nI New York.
