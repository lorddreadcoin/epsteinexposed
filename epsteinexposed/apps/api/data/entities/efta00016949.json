Mello Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New York 10007 \nApril 23, 2021 \nBY ELECTRONIC MAIL \nChristian Everdell, Esq. \nMark Cohen, Esq. \nCohen & \nGresser LLP \n800 Third Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \nLaura Menninger, Esq. \nJeffrey Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East Tenth Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nBobbi Stemheim, Esq. \nLaw Offices \nof Bobbi C. Stemheim \n33 \nWest 19th Street-4th Fl. \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Counsel: \nPursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government \nhereby \novides notice that it \nmay \ncall as an expert witness at trial a clinical \nThe Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide \nnotice if the Government elects to do so. \nI. \nDisclosure \nby the Government \nEFTA00016950\n\nPage 2 \nis expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience, \nand research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by \nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of \nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, \nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern \nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a  variety of forms and function to render the \nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment \nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware \nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may \nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the \nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the \nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological \nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of conStrauma. The presence of other \n• \nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. •\nis \nalso expected to testify that \nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for \na  variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted \nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. M. has not \nevaluated specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer \nM. testimony regarding any specific victim. \n• \nexpected testimony relies on her education and training on plycholo ical \ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on E. \nextensive clinical experience treatint individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in \nchildhood and adolescence, as well as E experience conducting forensic \npsychological \nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is \nproducing notes from the Government's interviews with M. today as well. \nII. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice \nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal \nnotice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert \nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that \nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as \nwell as the witness's qualifications. \nhas previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal \nand state litigation. As a courtesy, a  list of that testimony is also being produced to you today \nbearing Bates number 3502-002. \nEFTA00016951\n\nPage 3 \nAdditionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery \nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: \n(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or \ncopies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which \nthe defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or \nreports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in \nconnection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, \nand which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which \nwere prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. \nThe Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior \nstatements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. \n26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material \nbe provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with \n3500 material relating to Government \nwitnesses. \nVery truly \nyours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nUnited States Attorney \nby: \n/s/ \nAssistant United States \nAttorneys \nEFTA00016952",
