However I am afraid that horses and I do not mix particularly \nwell but the trip to see the Lines sounds really interesting. As far as \nfood is concerned I am very easy and will fit in with whatever he plans \nand I don't mind what time it is at all. As for girls well I leave that \nentirely to you and Juan Estoban! \nI am going to have more time after tomorrow to know what will happen and \nwhen in Peru so I will be in touch again on Friday. \nMasses of love A xxx \n Original Message \nFrom: G.
