The \"Jeffrey Epstein Archives\" document has several stories \ncontained within it. \nI do not have the letter that the Chief handed out, but some of these stories reference the letter. I do not believe \nthat the letter mentioned any specifics. But, when the State Attorney's Office basically shut down the case, the \nChief deemecilieolice investigation \"closed,\" which meant that the PC affidavits for the arrests of Epstein, \nand \nbecame public. \"The Smoking Gun\" published the redacted PC affidavits and later \npublished a portion of the Incident Report. Here are links to their stories. \nhttp://www.thesmokinggun.corn/archive/0726062epsteinl.html \nhttp://www.thesmokinggun.corn/archive/0727061epsteinl.html \nAssistant U.S. \nAttorney \n500 S.
