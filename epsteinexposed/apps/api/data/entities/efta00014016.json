I am writing to request a written staff opinion on an issue related to contact with \nunrepresented parties. \nAs part of my employment, I have investigated and presented for prosecution a \ncase \ninvolving the sexual abuse of several young women who were teenagers at the time of the \nabuse. \nThere is a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, that provides a civil cause of action for \nvictims of the federal crimes that I  investigated, which sets a  minimum of $150,000 in \ndamages. \nAt the request of counsel for the putative defendant, the U.S. Attorney's Office \nentered into pre-indictment plea negotiations that resulted in the signing of a Non-\nProsecution Agreement (\"Agreement\"). The Agreement called for the putative defendant to \nplead guilty to state criminal offenses that would result in the defendant's designation as a \nsex offender. The Agreement also sought to place the victims in the same position where \nthey would have been if the defendant had been convicted of the \nfederal offenses. \nAccordingly, the Agreement required the defendant to agree to waive challenges to liability \nand damages related to claims brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. In light of the large \n'In addition to the general rules regarding confidentiality, this letter relates to a confidential \nNon-Prosecution Agreement, and, accordingly, I would ask that the information contained herein \nremain confidential. \nEFTA00014016\n\nETHICS COUNSEL \nFLORIDA BAR \nSEPTEMBER 18, 2008 \nPAGE 2 \nnumber of young, vulnerable, and unsophisticated victims, the \nU.S. Attorney's Office also \nincluded agreement terms requiring the defendant to pay for the services of an \nindependent \nattorney-representative, whose services would be offered (without obligation) to the victims \nfree of charge. The U.S. \nAttorney's Office asked the former Chief United States District \nJudge to serve pro bono as a Special Master for the selection of the attorney-representative. \nThe Special Master selected Robert Josefsberg and his firm, Podhurst Orseck, to serve as the \nattorney-representative. \nUnder federal law, I  have several obligations related to victims, including an \nobligation to confer with them and advise them of resolution of their matters. See, e.g., 18 \nU.S.C. § \n3771. Accordingly, I have prepared a letter informing the victims of how the matter \nwas resolved, including the appointment of Mr. Josefsberg. The letter advises the victims \nthat Mr. Josefsberg will be in contact with them shortly and invites the victims to contact Mr. \nJosefsberg directly if they so \nchoose. A copy of the letter, with some identifying information \nredacted, is attached. This letter was reviewed by attorneys for the defendant before it was \nsent. \nDuring the pendency of the investigation, some of the victims retained civil attorneys \nto represent them in civil suits against the defendant. For those victims whom I knew to be \nrepresented, I sent a modified version of the letter to the attorney, rather than to the victim, \nand asked the attorney \nto convey the substance of the letter to the victim. In that letter, the \ndiscussion of contact with Mr. Josefsberg made clear that Mr. Josefsberg's contact would be \nwith the attorney only, not directly with the victim. A copy of the letter for those victims \nalready represented by counsel also is attached. \nI understand that you do not opine on past events, and some of these letters already \nhave been distributed, but several victims have yet to be notified, and I  need guidance on \nhow \nto proceed. \nUnbeknownst to me, one victim had obtained counsel prior to receiving my letter. I \nhave received a letter from that attorney asserting that my contact with the victims violates \nFlorida Bar Rule 4-7.4. I have reviewed the rule and do not understand how it would \napply \nto me \nbecause: (1) I am not soliciting employment from a prospective client; (2) I am not \nseeking pecuniary gain; (3) none of the victims has expressed a \ndesire not to receive \ncommunications from me; (4) the letter \ndoes not involve coercion, duress, fraud, \noverreaching, harassment, intimidation, or undue influence; (5) the letter is not false, \nfraudulent, misleading, or deceptive; and (6) there is nothing about the mental or physical \nEFTA00014017\n\nETHICS COUNSEL \nFLORIDA BAR \nSEPTEMBER 18, 2008 \nPAGE 3 \nstates of the victims that leads me to believe that they cannot review and understand the \ninformation that is included in the letter. \nCan you provide me with a written opinion on this issue so that I may revise the letters \nthat have not yet been \ndistributed if you deem it necessary? \nI  understand that the same attorney has made contact with Mr. Josefsberg, also \naccusing him of violating the same rule. Since the benefit to these victims will be lost if Mr. \nJosefsberg cannot advise them in detail of their rights under the Agreement, I understand that \nhis firm will be contacting your Office for similar guidance. \nPlease let me know if you need any additional information, and thank you for your \nkind assistance with this matter. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: \nAssistant United States \nAttorney \ncc: \nAUSA and Professional Responsibility Officer \n,AUSA \nEFTA00014018",
