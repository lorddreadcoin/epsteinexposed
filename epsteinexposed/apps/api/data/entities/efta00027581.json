Ghislaine Maxwell case pending in the SDNY. \nMs. has conveyed some concerns about her inability to properly prepare for her testimony whether for the \nprosecution or defense given that she has not been given a copy of the 1A notes that were originally prepared in \npreparation to the FD-302 written that she may be called to testify about. ( I will be able to elaborate via tel/cal with \nyou). \nAdditionally, my client was interviewed by Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) just prior to her retirement. This \ninterview was given under oath and in connection with her recollection of events of the Jeffrey Espstein investigation. \n(I can of course elaborate further via tel/cal with you.) \nPlease feel free to reach out to me at your earliest convenience to discuss further. \nIn the interim, moving forward all direct or indirect contact with Ms. should be coordinated through my \noffice. \nThank you. \nStuart N.
