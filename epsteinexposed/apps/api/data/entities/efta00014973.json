I suggest you \nreview through that system. I  have already given several people access to those machines. I can add \nmore as needed. All the additional exports with the exception of 6 machines have been completed \nand can be shipped over to Southern tomorrow. I'll be available in the afternoon after I get back from \nthe Bronx where ill be getting some information off some of the evidence that was already checked \nback in and is now in storage. If any of this needs clarification, please feel free to call my cell so we \ncan discuss. \nNY CART \nCoordinator \nSenior Forensic Examiner \ncell \ndesk \nOn Oct 13, 2020 1:56 \nPM, ' \n> \nwrote: \nStephen —\n•_ is copied on this and will be your POC for this week since is OCONUS. \nCan you pls let us know your progress on these devices and how our folks can review \nthem?
