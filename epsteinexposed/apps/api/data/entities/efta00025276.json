I did 5 hours on Saturday, another 3 yesterday, and have been here since 9. I  have successfully exported \nstuff from 41 items. I have another 8 left. They are all Macs and have been problematic. I will beat on it again \ntomorrow. I was able to do the exports with 5 machines. I will be down to 2 for the remaining Mac stuff. Will \nkeep you posted as to how stuff goes. \nNY CART Coordinator \nSenior Forensic Examiner \ncell \ndesk \nEFTA00025276",
