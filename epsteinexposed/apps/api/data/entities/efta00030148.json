We plan to produce the redacted notes to the defense pursuant to the protective order, and the name on an AEO \nbasis to defense counsel. Your letter states that both will be provided on an AEO, which misstates our intention. \n2. When we discussed this, we understood that this would not be submitted to defense counsel prior to Judge \nTorres ruling on your request. There is no language in the letter to that effect, and it seems appropriate to add it. \n3. Please add \"to the defense\" in the first letter to make clear to the Court that you are intervening in our \nproduction of discovery to defense counsel in this matter (and not, for instance, in a disclosure to the public or \nany other entity). \nThanks. \nOn Dec 25, 2019, at 10:25 AM, Andrew Patel wrote: \nWe have attached a copy (draft) of our letter to Judge Torres.

Could you please send us a copy of the letter before \nyou file it, so that we can ensure that our position is accurately represented? Thanks very much. \n----Original Message---\nFrom: Andrew Patel <I \nSent: Friday, December 20, 2019 5:14  PM \nTo: \n) \nCc: Jill Shellow \n• \nSubject: RE: pstein \n>; \nDon Yannella \nI>; Andrew Patel \nWe have attached a proposed disclosure cover letter that is modeled on a letter sent by the Government in United States v. \nMadonna, 17 Cr. 89 (CS). We have also attached proposed redacted disclosures. As you and I  discussed, we offer this as \na means to ensure our client's safety while permitting the Government to comply with what you believe are your \ndisclosure obligations. \nAs an alternative, we are willing to apply under seal to Judge Torres for a Protective Order to preclude the disclosure. \nOur client is not a witness, and so this is not 3500 material, nor is it Rule 16 material. We do not believe that this is in \nfact Brady material, but rather is an error made by our client that we understand is contradicted by the surveillance video \nevidence. While we applaud your efforts, we have an obligation to make sure that our client is not harmed by the \npossible release of the fact that he met with your Office. \nWe understand that you have time constraints. Please let us know how you want to proceed so that we can file a motion \nbefore Judge Torres promptly if that is necessary. \nAndy \nAndrew G.
