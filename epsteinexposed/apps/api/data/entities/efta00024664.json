This will cast the defense and defense case \nin a  negative light as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won't. \nOur previous email explained our reasons for firmly pressing the 11/8 trial date, \nbut as an accommodation, we would consider starting on 11/15, but no later. \nFor now, we will not agree to exclusion of speedy trial time beyond 11/8. \nThese scheduling conflicts can be easily eliminated by consenting to bail for Ms. Maxwell. \nIt is unclear why the scheduling order, which contemplated a  continuance, should be altered. \nAs previously discussed and raised with the Court, we need to review of 3500 material \nand exhibits before determining the need to call any experts. \nEnjoy the day. \nBobbi \nBOBBI C.

Regarding the trial date, after considering the availability of \nwitnesses and counsel, we plan to propose a trial date of November 29, 2021.

In addition, please let us know \nwhether you consent to an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act between now and the new trial date the \nCourt selects. \nWith respect to other scheduling matters, we intend to propose that the Court set a deadline of three months before \ntrial for the Government to disclose the identities of victims referenced in the indictment; this is an earlier proposal \nthan the timeframe we had originally proposed for the July trial date.
