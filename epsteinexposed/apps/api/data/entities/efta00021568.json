(It may have been there from an old version this morning.) Either way, since it \nnow quotes from the public Second Circuit docket, I think we don't need to redact that bit. \nWill, I caught a nit in the first sentence of V.C.I — it says \"Ex. 1014:9\" instead of \"Ex. 10 at 14:9.\" \nOtherwise, I am pencils down! (Maurene, if you still think it's useful to create a public, redacted version of the July depo, I \ncan do that quickly while you finalize.) \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, February 26, 2021 9:17 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Working doc \nHere you go. Almost done with inputting your edits as well. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, February 26, 2021 9:14 PM \nTo: \nSubject: Working doc \nHey M- would you send me the working doc when you have a second? I'm just taking a quick look at the redactions, no \ntextual changes are coming! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 Saint Andrews Plaza \nNew York, \nNew York 10007 \nEFTA00021568",
