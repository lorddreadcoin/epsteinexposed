NATHAN, District Judge: \nOn April 27, 2021, the Court denied Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's request for \nauthorization to serve a subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Dkt. No. 252. The Court \nrequested the Government's views as to three of those requests: Request 9, which sought \nproduction of Minor Victim-2's entire diary from her teenage years; Request 10, which targeted \na pair of boots that Minor Victim-2 allegedly received as a gift from Jeffrey Epstein and \nMaxwell; and Request 11, which sought original versions of certain photographs. Id. The \nGovernment submitted its views on May 4, 2021. Dkt. No. 269. It supplemented its letter on \nMay 6, 2021. Dkt. No. 271. The Defendant filed a response on May 12, 2021. Having \nconsidered the parties' views, the Defendant's request is denied in full. \nAs noted, Request 9 seeks the original copy of a journal from an alleged victim from \nwhen she was a teenager. Maxwell received copies of some of the pages in the journal from the \nGovernment pursuant to Rule 16, but the Government represents that it does not have access to \nthe entire journal. In those pages, Minor Victim-2 describes a trip to New York in which she \nspent time with Epstein and, among other things, visited his residence. Minor Victim-2 also \ndescribes her impression of Epstein at the time. There is no indication that Maxwell is \nmentioned there or anywhere else in the journal. \nI \nEFTA00015859\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 2 of 6 \nMaxwell appears to proffer two theories of relevance as to the entire journal. While she \nstudiously avoids using the word, one such theory relates to impeachment. As this Court has \nnoted, the potential impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or \nenforcement of a Rule 17(c) subpoena because such materials would only become relevant after \na witness has testified. United States v. Slcelos, No. 15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at \n*2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021) (collecting cases). \nThe other theory of relevance that Maxwell proffers is that if the rest of the journal does \nnot mention her, the journal as a whole may serve as exculpatory evidence. At best, the theory \namounts to little more than a \"fishing expedition,\" which is not the proper use of Rule 17(c). See \nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-70 (1974). In any event, the argument is too \nspeculative to meet the standard set forth in Nixon. To begin with, the request appears to be \noverbroad; under Rule 17(c), the moving party must show that all of the requested material is \nrelevant. Cf. United States v. Pena, No. 15-CR-551 (MN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. \nFeb. 12, 2016). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor \nVictim-2's first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of \nreferences to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the \nrelevance of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here, \ntoo, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2's anticipated testimony as \nto specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim's anticipated \ntestimony. \nIn addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the relevance of the rest of the diary \nother than the pages she has already received. BSF has represented that the rest of the journal \ndoes not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. Dkt. No. 191 at 5. The Government has similarly \n2 \nEFTA00015860\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 3 of 6 \nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after \nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she \ntook with Epstein. Dkt. No. 204 at 187. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to \ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the \ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references \nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which \nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to \npotential impeachment. \nNor do any of Maxwell's additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the \njournal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules 106 and Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of \nEvidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule 17(c). She \ncites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of attorney-client privilege that have no \napplication to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an \nargument under Rule 106 or Rule 612, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule 106 \nand Rule 612 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only \nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admitted. Her Rule 612 argument is \nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to \nproduction of the entire journal. The Rule provides that \"[i]f the producing party claims that the \nwriting includes unrelated matter, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any \nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\" Fed. R. Evid. \n612(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that \nthe rest of the journal is unrelated. In any event, none of these principles establish the relevance \nof the journal beyond impeachment, and all of the arguments presented to the contrary are \n3 \nEFTA00015861\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 4 of 6 \nmeritless. Lastly, Maxwell's theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal \nwas written and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication \ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual \nreason to doubt the journal's authenticity. In her May 12, 2021 letter, Maxwell claims that two \ncopies of one of the pages are \"obviously, and noticeably, different.\" The difference, which is \nnot explained in the letter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing \nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a \nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of \nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here \nagain Maxwell's arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For \nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule 17(c) subpoena is not the proper \nvehicle for Request 9. \nRequest 10 seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein \nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that \nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI's possession, the \nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. \nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots' production to the defense. \nThe argument is meritless. Rule I7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third \nparties where the sought-after item is \"otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.\" \nNixon, 418 U.S. at 698-700. That is the case here: The Government has represented that the \ndefense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. The Defendant's request is therefore denied \nas moot. If the Government fails to make the boots available for inspection within a reasonable \n4 \nEFTA00015862\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 5 of 6 \ntimeframe, the Defendant may make an application to the Court to compel the Government to \nadhere to its representation. \nRequest 11 seeks production of the original versions of certain photographs of the alleged \nvictim. Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their \nauthenticity. In its May 6 letter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset \nof the photographs are in the FBI's possession, and the Government will make those photographs \navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that \nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to \ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon \nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court. \nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has \nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already \nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers \nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are \ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell \ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because \nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule 17(c), the request fails to meet Nixon's \nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish \nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet know the scope of the victim's \ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs. \nI.
