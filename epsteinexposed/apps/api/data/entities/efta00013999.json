As I'm sure you know, two of Mr. Epstein's victims have filed suit against the United States alleging that \nthe government violated their rights as victims by not consulting them prior to entering into the Non-Prosecution Agreement. \nAs part of their response to one of the government's filings, the victims asked the Court to order the production of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement. The deadline for the government to respond is August 15th and we intend to oppose the motion based upon the confidentiality \nprovision. I have attached a copy of the victims' pleading for your review. \nIn connection with this, we want to make certain that we are making consistent representations to the judiciary regarding the contents of \nthe Agreement. I  know that Jack Goldberger filed the Agreement under seal in the state court in accordance with the state judge's order. \nCan you provide us with a copy of what Jack filed, so that, if we are ordered by the federal court to disclose the agreement, it is exactly the \nsame as what has been filed in the state court? \nEFTA00013999\n\nThank you again for your assistance. \nRegards, \n<<DE19_080801_Victims' Rap to Notice.pdf>> \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \nPhone \nFax \nEFTA00014000",
