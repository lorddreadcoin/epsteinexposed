If \nnot, would you by any chance be able to put the drive in an envelope marked with my name on it and leave it with \nsecurity at 1 St. Andrews? \nAlso, we are still hoping to hear from you about what your team expects to say tomorrow and your position regarding \nthe subpoena we discussed. I'm available for a call any time this evening to discuss. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Miller, Michael \nSent: Monda Au ust 26 2019 3:03 PM \nTo \nCc \nSubject: Epstein \nEFTA00032139\n\nUMW\nI will get down to court a few minutes early tomorrow and can hand deliver the hard \nus with the first round of production if someone can arrange to meet me outside of the \ncourthouse. Let me know if that works. More broadly, I believe that the Epstein defense team will be in \ncompliance with the protective order by the time we start in court tomorrow and, if not, it will only be a matter \nof a stray clean up point or two. I'll give you more details in the morning. Mike \nMichael C.
