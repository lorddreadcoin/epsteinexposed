Thanks,M \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, October 29, 2019 11:45 AM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Daily Beast story on Epstein investigation \nFor whatever it's worth, this article seems to be almost entirely based on information from Spencer Kuvin, who has been \nan extremely frustrating and unhelpful presence during our case—he routinely has been quoted in media reports saying \nthings that are completely wrong (and actively harmful to the investigation). As an example, he wasn't even at either of \nthe meetings he's purporting to have information on here. Additionally, none of us on the team has literally ever spoken \nwith him or met him, nor are we aware of any victim clients that he actually currently represents (despite his repeated \nclaims that he actively represents victims), and we're also not aware of anyone who intends to meet with us who's a client \nof his. \nObviously we have no control over him or anyone who uses him as a source, but he has put inaccurate information out a \nnumber of times (including that he has any clients who have spoken with us and/or intend to) so I figured it might be \nuseful to let you know. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesda \nTo: \nOctober 29, 2019 10:32 \nCc: \nSubject: Daily Beast story on Epstein investigation \nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-case-federal-prosecutors-are-lining-up-witnesses-against-his-cronies? \nref=home \nT'S NOT OVER \nEFTA00023920\n\nFederal Prosecutors \nAre Lining Up Witnesses \nAgainst Jeffrey Epstein's Cronies \nNumerous Epstein victims have met with prosecutors in recent days. \nKate Briquelet \nSenior Reporter\nPervaiz Shallwani \nSenior Editor & Writer \nPublished 10.29.19 4:47AM ET \nEXCLUSIVE \nPhoto Illustration by The Daily BeastlPhotos Getty \nIt's been more than two months since Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but the \ninvestigation into possible \naccomplices is still very much alive. In recent days, federal \nprosecutors probing the financier's sex\n-trafficking ring have been asking Epstein \nvictims if they could serve as witnesses in the criminal case they are building. \nRepresentatives from the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of New \nYork traveled to Florida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein's victims and \ntheir counsel. \nThe staffers, who worked in the victim services unit, held a similar \nmeeting in New York on Oct. 23, lawyers for the women and a law enforcement \nsource told The Daily \nBeast. \nADVERTISEMENT \nTwo people familiar with the investigation said \nthat prosecutors have heard from \n\"dozens\" of witnesses or victims since Epstein's arrest in \nJuly. \nFollowing Epstein's death in August, which was ruled a suicide by \nhanging, the \nDepartment of Justice said that it would continue to investigate anyone who helped \nEpstein procure underage girls or helped him to cover up \ncrimes. A spokesman for \nthe Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on where the probe \nstands, only saying \nthat the \"investigation is continuing.\" \nEFTA00023921\n\nSpencer Kuvin, a \nPalm Beach attorney who represents two women who were abused \nby Epstein, said the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of New York \noffered counseling services to the group of \nvictims who gathered in Miramar, Florida. \nThe \nrepresentatives also worked to debunk conspiracy theories, which the victims \nhave \nencountered online, related to Epstein's  jailhouse suicide. According to Kuvin, \nprosecutors continue to battle speculation on how \nthe 66-year-old money-\nmanager died, \nalong with rumors that he isn't dead at all. \n\"The U.S. Attorney's Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories—\nthat he was killed, that he's still alive. There are people still talking about \nthat,\" \nKuvin told The Daily Beast. \"There are still people that think this was an \nabsolute \nruse and he's sitting \npretty in another part of the world.\" \nKuvin said \ninvestigators assured the women that their probe into Epstein's alleged \nco-conspirators was ongoing. The lawyer declined to \ncomment on the identities of \nthose suspected accomplices. \nADVERTISING \n\"They wanted to meet with some of the \nvictims to discuss whether or not they could \nbe potential witnesses in that ongoing investigation,\" Kuvin said. \"One of my clients \nis going to meet with them \nprivately about that issue.\" \nDuring the Florida meeting, \ncoordinators for federal prosecutors answered questions \nfrom \nthe women, some of whom felt burned over their treatment 12 years ago, when \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami secretly negotiated a cushy plea deal for Epstein. \nBack then, \nthe feds promised the women they'd prosecute the creepy \nmultimillionaire; instead, they collaborated with his \nlegal team to downgrade the \ncharges. \n\"The focus really is: What \nare you doing now and are you honestly going to pursue \nthe co-conspirators or are those just words?\" Kuvin said. \nEFTA00023922\n\n\"They've been wronged by the system numerous times,\" Kuvin added of his clients \nand other victims of \nEpstein, \"from the late 2000S all the way up to him killing \nhimself. Every time an official comes forward and says, `Don't \nworry. We're going to \ndo the right thing,' they \nshake their heads and say, `We'll see.'\" \nIn New York last week, prosecutors met with victims at a federal building downtown \nwhere local FBI headquarters is housed to inform the women of their rights and offer \ncounseling services. \nDuncan Levin, a former \nassistant U.S. Attorney and chief of asset forfeiture at the \nManhattan District Attorney's \noffice, said Epstein's inner circle shouldn't rest easy. \n\"There is at least some evidence that other people facilitated his crimes, and there's \nobviously enough public interest in the case that [prosecutors] aren't going to drop it \njust because he's dead,\" said Levin, managing \npartner at Tucker Levin, PLLC. \nLevin said prosecutors are likely to thoroughly investigate Epstein's alleged enablers \nand seek forfeiture of Epstein's properties that were used to facilitate the sex crimes. \nA bare-bones rundown of Epstein's assets \nsubmitted by his lawyers following his \narrest, and bank records obtained by prosecutors, provided a glimpse \ninto Epstein's \nnet worth which is estimated at more than $550 million, but it may not \nbe a \ncomplete accounting. The listed assets \nincluded $56 million in cash and another \n$500 million in properties and \ninvestments. \nThe \nproperties include $85 million worth of real estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands—\nincluding his own private island—an $8.6 million Paris apartment, a $12 million \nPalm \nBeach estate, a $17 million New Mexico ranch, and his Manhattan mansion—\nEFTA00023923\n\nwhich Epstein claimed is worth $55 \nmillion but prosecutors have said is worth \n$T7 \nmillion. \n\"Justice is a slow-moving train,\" Levin said. \"This is \npar for the course. Investigations \nare measured in months and years not days and weeks.\" \n\"I would be very nervous if I were somebody who helped Jeffrey Epstein at this point \nand would be seeking legal counsel,\" Levin added. \nEpstein was arrested on July_6 and charged with sex-trafficking and conspiracy to \ncommit sex-trafficking. The indictment referred to three victims and \nthree unnamed \nemployees of Epstein who allegedly \nassisted in the sex pyramid scheme. \nAccording to the complaint, \nEpstein created a \"network of minor victims in multiple \nstates to sexually abuse and exploit\" and \"worked and conspired \nwith others, \nincluding employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other \nthings, \ncontacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein.\" \nFrom 2002 \nto 2005, \nthe indictment states, \nEpstein \"enticed and recruited\" minor \ngirls as young as 14 to visit his \nmansions and engage in sex acts with him, after which \nhe or his assistants gave the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. \nIt's unclear which alleged co-conspirators prosecutors are targeting. \nIn one July court filing, prosecutors requested a protective order, indicating they \nplanned to produce certain documents and materials that \"would impede, if \nprematurely disclosed, the \nGovernment's ongoing investigation of uncharged \nindividuals.\" \nIn \n2008, when Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, his non-prosecution \nagreement with the feds granted immunity to his alleged accomplices, \"including but \nnot \nlimited to \nEFTA00023924\n\nlawyer, Michael Bachner, previously told The Daily Beast: \"At no time during \nemployment with Epstein did \nshe ever engage in any misconduct.\" \nAttorneys \nfor \ntold CNN last month that she was a victim \nherself and \"is \nand has been severely traumatized.\" They added: \"She needs time to process and \nmake sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out.\" \nAccording to the report, spokeswoman had a \nsimilar explanation. \"Very soon \nafter was brought into \nEpstein's world, he began to sexually abuse her, and \nthis abuse went on for \nyears. \ncontinues to struggle \nwith the trauma of her \nexperiences and has chosen not to speak publicly \nat this time.\" \n= hasn't spoken \npublicly on the allegations. \nOne lawsuit, filed by a Jane Doe in September against Epstein's estate, describes \nand = as a pair of adult employees who \"specifically facilitated his abuse.\" \nThe women \nscheduled the girl's visits to Epstein's Manhattan mansion and \"often \nasked Doe to bring other girls with her,\" paying her every time she did so. \nMeanwhile, =, a former assistant to Epstein, is facing a lawsuit from-\n, \nwho says she was in high school when Epstein raped and abused her. A \nsecond \nassistant, \n, is also listed as a defendant in the case. \ncomplaint also \ntargets Epstein's alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell—who's \nkept a low \nprofile since the hedge-funder's arrest and has long  faced accusations of \nrecruiting underage girls and taking part in sexual abuse herself. \nAnother lawsuit, recently filed by Priscilla Doe, alleges that \"in addition to providing \nsexual \ninstruction, Ghislaine Maxwell further made sure that Plaintiff and the other \nEFTA00023925\n\nyoung females were constantly on call to sexually service Jeffrey Epstein.\" \nMaxwell isn't the only Epstein friend under scrutiny in the press. Authorities in \nFrance are looking into sexual misconduct claims \nagainst talent scout Jean-Luc \nBrunel, accused in civil court filings of procuring young models for \nEpstein to \nexploit. \n\"Jeffrey Epstein has told me that he has \nslept with over 1,000 of Brunel's girls, and \neverything that I have seen \nconfirms this claim,\" said accuser \nin a \n2015 affidavit. \nsays she was 16 when Maxwell \nrecruited her into Epstein's \ntrafficking ring. \nIn response, Brunel issued a statement denying claims, saying he \nnever \nparticipated \"directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being \naccused of.\" \nLast year, Epstein may have attempted to buy the silence of alleged co-conspirators \njust as his name re-emerged in the \npress. \nProsecutors say Epstein wired payments to two \nunnamed women—one received \n$250,000 while the other \ngot $100,000—shortly after the Miami Herald's exposé \non \nEpstein's 2007 sweetheart deal. Those individuals were listed as possible co-\nconspirators in Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said \nin \nJuly. \nAt a bail hearing that month, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \ntold the court \nthat \"after seven days of this case being public following \nmonths of a covert \ninvestigation, the evidence is already significantly stronger and getting stronger \nevery single day. \nEFTA00023926\n\n\"Many individuals identifying \nthemselves as victims and witnesses have contacted \nthe government,\" Rossmiller continued, \n\"and we are in the process of receiving and \ncorroborating this additional evidence.\" \nBrad Edwards, an attorney who sued the  government on behalf of victims over \nEpstein's lenient plea deal, said, \"I assume that if there are others that \nshould be held \naccountable for crimes that can still \nbe prosecuted, then they will.\" \nEdwards \nsaid he trusts that New York prosecutors \"are trying to leave no stone \nunturned.\" \nLast month, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra refused to scrap the non-prosecution \nagreement that shielded Epstein and his alleged co-conspirators from facing serious \ncharges—despite Marra's ruling that the agreement was illegal. \nMarra also denied the victims' requests for other relief: \nattorneys' fees, a hearing \nwhere victims could speak, and the release of documents including grand jury \nmaterials. The decision was part of a 2008 lawsuit Jane Does 1 and 2 filed against the \nUnited States, alleging \nthe feds violated the Crime Victims' Right Act. \nwho has come forward as Jane Doe 1, has appealed to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the iith Circuit. \nOral arguments are scheduled for January. \n\"A ruling rescinding the immunity provisions would have permitted the victims to \nconfer with government prosecutors about the possibility of obtaining prosecution of \nEpstein's \nco-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida —  i.e., would have \nafforded them their rights under the CVRA,\" appeal states. \nEFTA00023927\n\nPervaiz Shallwani \nSenior Editor & Writer \nkbri eletkate br thedail beast com \nEFTA00023928",
