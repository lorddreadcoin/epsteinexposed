On that same day, \nin that same mailbox, \nI deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building.

Her trial begins on November 29th. \nEvery delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare \nfor trial. \nYour prompt response is requested. \nThank you-\nBobbi \nEFTA00015130\n\nBOBBI C.
