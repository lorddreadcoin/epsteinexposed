Additionally, the AUSA office is asking of your findings of the \nligature. If possible could you give me a call, may be easier than emailing back and forth. We are working on getting the \ninterviews of those who discovered the body but there are some legalities to that. \nEFTA00013194\n\nSubject: \nRE: \nEpstein \nEFTA00013195",
