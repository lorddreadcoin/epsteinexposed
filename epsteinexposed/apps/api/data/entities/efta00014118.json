Jeffrey Epstein \nDate: Wed, 17 Sep 2008 15:25:14 +0000 \nImportance: Normal \n(USAFLS)\" \nGiven the non-disclosure agreement, aren't we left with telling the SAO that we have agreed to not disclose so it wouldn't \nbe proper for us to now agree that unsealing is appropriate. Ultimately, it's the SAO's call because they will get the Florida \nPublic Records Act request and they were not a signatory to the agreement. We should also notify defense counsel so \nthat they can take whatever actions they believe are appropriate. Wait till others have had a chance to weigh in on this \nissue. \nFrom: (USAFLS) \nSent: Wednesday, September 17, 2008 10:50 AM \nTo: \n(USAFLS) \nCc: (USAFLS) \nSubject: FW: State v.

Jeffrey Epstein \nMs. Belohlavek, \nWe represent The Palm Beach Daily News. The newspaper recently discovered that a non-prosecution agreement (and \nan addendum thereto) was filed under seal pursuant to an agreed order entered in the above-referenced case. Because \nthe records are sealed, we cannot assess the propriety of the decision to seal them or even whether the newspaper is \ninterested in the information contained therein. I was hoping you would discuss with me the nature of the agreement and \nthe basis for sealing it so that we can advise our client on whether it should pursue an order unsealing the agreement. \nPlease call me at your earliest convenience. \nVery truly yours, \nC.
