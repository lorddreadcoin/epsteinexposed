To respond to your question generally, in \nconnection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request \na consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire about his \nrelationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that have arisen \npublicly and in our investigation to date. \nAlthough we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a  request through diplomatic and law enforcement \nchannels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has legal \nrepresentation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance. \nCertainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as a \nthreshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. \nRegards, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nFrom: Gary Bloxsome \nSent: Friday, January 03, 2020 10:30 \nTo: \n; Daniel Cundy \n>; Jennifer Richardson .zz\n> \nSubject: Re: U.S. Department of Justice investigation \nDear Sirs, \nThank you for your email dated 2 January 2020. \nI confirm that we do represent HRH the Duke of York. \nI would be grateful if you could please clarify what specifically you invite us to contact you about. \nKind regards \nGary Bloxsome \nGary Bloxsome I Partner \nEFTA00030693\n\nwww.blackfords.com \nBlackfords LLP is a  limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number \n0C325398 at Hill House, 1 Mint Walk, Croydon, CR0 lEA.
