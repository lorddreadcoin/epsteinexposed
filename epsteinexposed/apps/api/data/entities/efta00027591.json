That's why I'm \nasking the \n6 questions. No one \nhas specified how often, \n7 how frequently he is \nto have contact with \n8 his \nparole and probation officer. \n9 Confinement to an agreed upon residence \n10 \nduring the hours away from employment and \n11 \npublic service activity, has that been \n12 articulated? \n13 \nMS. BELOHLAVEK: I believe \n,f \n1 \n14 \nJudge McSorley has a standard order \n15 somewhere on the bench up there \nregarding \n16 this, \nI'm told by the prosecutor. \n17 MS. LENHARDT: \nJudge, usually this is \n18 . \nthe probation sheet she hands \nout to folks. \n19 \nTHE \nCOURT: I have seen those \n20 sheets -- I have seen them \nincorporated \nin \n21 plea agreements which is why I'm asking. \n22 MR.

We were \n6 -- we overreacted by \njust having him sign \n7 off on all conditions of community control. \n8 THE COURT: Well, this is --\n9 \nMR. GOLDBERGER: Perhaps the \nbetter \n10 practice would be --\n11 THE COURT: This is, the reason \n12 Judge McSorley does this which makes \n13 ultimate sense is we're going to be here \n14 half the morning if we're going to decide \n15 among \nourselves now \nwhat the --\n16 MR.

BELOHLAVEK: We can take care of \n20 that right now if you could give us a few \n21 minutes. \n22 THE COURT: All right. \n23 These are the standard conditions \n24 \nthat Judge \nMcSorley normally uses. If you \n25 \nlike them, you need to \ncircle the ones that \nPHYLLIS A.

We \nwill go over it. If you wish to change \n3 you \nunderstand there is quite a bit of \n4 latitude given the court in putting \n5 \nsomebody on community control. If you \n6 agree \nto \nsome \nchange, let \nme know, but \n7 understand \nat the outset that I'm a big fan \n8 of specificity. I want to \nknow what he \n9 will be doing for employment. I want to \n10 know exactly where he is going to be living \n11 and I want it on the record now. It can \n12 change but it can \nonly change with \n13 \npreapproval by DOC. I want it crystal \n14 clear. I don't \nwant the community \ncontrol \n15 officer who \ngets this case the day he walks \n16 \nout the Palm Beach County to \nhave any doubt \n17 or \nconfusion as to exactly what this \n18 defendant is supposed to do, \nwhere he is \n19 \nsupposed to be when, exactly \nwhat I am \n20 \nrequesting that officer to supervise. \n21 \nMS. BELOHLAVEK: Absolutely. \n22 \nTHE COURT: Okay. \n23 \nMR. GOLDBERGER: We will work on it. \n24 Thank \nyou, Your Honor. \n25 \nTHE \nCOURT: We will recall that case. \nPHYLLIS A.

BELOHLAVEK: Yes, and Your Honor, \nthis defendant doesn't fall under the sex \noffender probation but we have included \n14 special sex offender conditions as part of \n15 the community control and they are all \n16 \ncircled there. \n17 . THE COURT: The plea agreement stated \n18 the defendant is designated as a sexual \n19 offender pursuant to Florida Statute \n20 \n942.035. \n21 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. \nBut the \n22 sex offender probation, the statute is \n23 different and only applies to certain \n24 offenses and this one was not enumerated. \n25 THE COURT: Okay.

GOLDBERGER: Correct. \n7 THE COURT: And we will \ntalk about \n8 \nthat. \n9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. \n10 THE COURT: But it is \nnot the one \n11 that requires the special conditions of sex \n12 offender \nprobation? \n13 \nMS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. \n14 THE COURT: Now, rather than 948, do \n15 you want me to disregard 948? He's read \n16 it? \n17 \nMS. BELOELAVEK: He's read it. \n18 THE COURT: We will leave it in \n19 \nthere. But these conditions we are going \n20 \nto go over right now are going to be viewed \n21 in my \nmind, yes, and they have been signed \n22 \nby the defendant and we will go over that \n23 \n24 \n25 \nin a second as a part of the whole plea. \nMS.
