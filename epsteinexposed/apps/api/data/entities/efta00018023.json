Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in \nCBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for \nMaxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. However, \nif you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date range you \nlooking for. \nSince as two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were \nprovided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel \ncrossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in chronological \norder for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review her travel rather \nthan going back and forth between the two PDFs. \nIf you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't hesitate \nto reach out! \nRespectfully, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection \nTask Force Officer - SDNY \nUS Attorney's Office \nSouthern District of New York \nMobile: \nDesk: \nRaymond Sanicolaia<usdoj.gov \n(LES/FOUO) LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \nWARNING: \nThe information contained in this email is considered confidential and sensitive in nature as well as sensitive but \nunclassified and/or legally privileged information.
