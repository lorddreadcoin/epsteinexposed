Berman, the United States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York. \nIt is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is \ncarried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein \nand other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke \nof York's help was on 2 January 2020. \nThe Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you \nconfirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation. \nEFTA00019885\n\nDue to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any \ninterview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add \nto the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed \nthat any arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. \nWe indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which \nwould need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to \nobtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email \ndated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that \nwe confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. \nInstead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United \nStates Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 \nJanuary 2020. This led to press reports that there had been \"a wall of silence\" and that there had been \"zero co-\noperation\" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. \nQuite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of \njustice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in \nconfidence, to assist their investigation. \nIn England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal \ncases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. \nWhen we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to \napologise and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be \nconfidential. \nWe cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat \nwhat he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is \nno \npurpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. \nFinally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we \nask that you treat this email as private and confidential. \nRegards \nGary \nGary Bloxsome I Partner \nBlackfords LLP 115 Old Bailey I London I EC4M 7EF \nDX 161400 Old Bailey 5  1 020 \n3427 3343 I www.blackfords.com \nEFTA00019886\n\n$ RANKED IN • \nChambers fo \n% UK \n• \n• \n4P0 2020 e \nlavdIn \nWS \nop \nTIER \n2020 \nBlackfords RP is a  limited liability partnership registered in England & Wales with registered number OC325398 at Hill House, 1 Mint \nWalk, Croydon, CRO 1EA.
