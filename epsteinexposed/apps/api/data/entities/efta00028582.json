Noel and Thomas, 19 Cr. \n830 (AT) \nDear Judge Tones: \nThe Government submits this letter to inform the Court that the parties have entered into \ndeferred prosecution agreements (the \"Agreements\"), which have been approved by Pretrial \nServices and are included for the Court's consideration.' After a thorough investigation, and based \non the facts of this case and the personal circumstances of the defendants, the Government has \ndetermined that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District. \nThe proposed Agreements contemplate an additional six-month term of supervision by Pretrial \nServices and, in addition to the standard terms of pretrial supervision, the proposed Agreements \ninclude the additional salient terms: \n• The defendants will cooperate with a  pending Department of Justice Office of Inspector \nGeneral review by providing truthful information related to their employment by the \nBureau of Prisons, including about the events and circumstances described in the \nIndictment; and \n• The defendants will complete 100 hours of community service, preferably in an area related \nto the criminal justice system. \nThe defendants have consented to the entry of the Agreements and have also admitted that \nthey \"willfully and knowingly completed materially false count and round slips regarding required \ncounts and rounds in the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August \n9, 2019 and August 10, 2019.\" \nThe Government respectfully requests, with the consent of the defendants, through counsel, \nthat the Court schedule a hearing date for entry of the Agreements. Having conferred with defense \n'  As the deferred prosecution agreements are not final until they are approved by the Court, the \nGovernment has not filed them publicly with this letter. \nEFTA00028582\n\nPage 2 \ncounsel, \nthe Government \nproposes the following dates, \nshould any of them prove \nconvenient for \nthe \nCourt: \n[DATES] \nRespectfully submitted, \nAUDREY STRAUSS \nUnited \nStates Attorney \nBy:  /s/ \nIr \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nCc: \nDefense Counsel \nPretrial Services \nEFTA00028583",
