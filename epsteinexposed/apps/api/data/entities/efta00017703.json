Attached is a sample slide for a model. All the slides will be this same format—the document is an \nexcerpt from flight records.

I'm handling the rest of the slides, but if you could possibly make about seven slides to drop in, \nthat would be a big help — I need to add a few that will all be the same format. Any chance you have time tomorrow? \nThanks! \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY \n10007 \nEFTA00017705",
