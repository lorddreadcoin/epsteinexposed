Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley \nSquare \nNew York, NY 10007 \nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear \nJudge Nathan: \nSOD Third Avenue \nNew York, NY \n10022 \n+1 212 \n957 \n7600 phone \nwyny.cohencressercom \nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government's \nOctober 6, 2020 letter requesting the Court's permission to delay the disclosure of photographs \nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the \n\"Materials\"), pursuant to Rule 16(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 60). \nThe government's request should be denied for two reasons. \nFirst, it is clear from the government's letter that the Materials pertain to individuals who \nclaim to have been \"sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein\" (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms. \nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials \nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be \ndisclosed pursuant to the government's obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) \nand its progeny.' \nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule 16 \nbecause the Materials are \"material to preparing the defense\" and the government has not shown \ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule 16(d)(1). \nI We note that yesterday we sent the government a letter making specific Brady requests, including \"[a]ny statements \nor written communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr. \nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.\" \nEFTA00023329\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page 2 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2020 \nPage 2 \nA. Applicable Law \n1. Brady \n\"Under Brady and its progeny, `the Government has a constitutional duty to disclose \nfavorable evidence to the accused where such evidence is `material' either to guilt or to \npunishment.\"' United States v.

Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2001)). \"Favorable evidence\" that \nmust be disclosed for purposes of Brady \"includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the \naccused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness,\" id., \nalso known as \"Giglio material,\" as well as any statements of witnesses \"which are contradictory \nor inconsistent with the government's theory of the case.\" United States v. Harris, No. 00 Cr. 105 \n(RPP), 2000 WL 1273720, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2000) (citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 \n(1995). \n2. Rule 16 \nRule 16 provides, in pertinent part: \nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the \ndefendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, \ndocuments, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or \nplaces, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is \nwithin the government's possession, custody, or control and . . . the \nitem is material to preparing the defense[.] \nFed.

R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1). To \nestablish good cause, the party must show \"that disclosure will result in a clearly defined, specific \nand serious injury.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations \nomitted). A finding of harm \"must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential \nharm, not on conclusory statements.\" Id. (citations omitted). \nEFTA00023330\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page 3 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2020 \nPage 3 \nB. Discussion \n1. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the \nGovernment's Theory of the Charged Crimes \nThe government states that, as part of its \"broader investigation into Epstein's sexual abuse \nof minors,\" it interviewed \"dozens\" of alleged victims of Epstein's sexual abuse and obtained \nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted \nafter 1997 —  i.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the \nsuperseding indictment (the \"Indictment\"). (Dkt. 60 at 2). Stated differently, the government has \ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms. \nMaxwell participated in Epstein's alleged sexual abuse, or \"groomed\" them for Epstein, or had \nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced. \nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the \ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still \nfundamentally inconsistent with the government's theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein's \n\"madam\" and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme. \nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government's theory of the perjury \ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment \nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after 1997, and therefore \"post-date \nthe time period charged in the Indictment.\" (Dkt. 60 at 2). That is incorrect. The government \nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein's sexual abuse that occurred after 1997 when it \nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment. \nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2015 by \none of Epstein's alleged victims (\"Accuser-1\"). In December 2014, Accuser-1 filed a motion to \njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein's Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2007. \nAccuser-I's motion \"described Maxwell's role as one of the main women who Epstein used to \nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his \nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.\" ((Accuser-I] v. Maxwell, 15-CV-07433 (RWS) \n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. 1  at ¶ 27). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l's allegations, claiming that \nthey were untrue. Accuser-1, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms. \nMaxwell. \nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case. \nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the 1994-1997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms. \nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knowledge of Epstein's sexual \nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein's sexual abuse after 1997 is \ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions. \nEFTA00023331\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page \n4 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2020 \nPage 4 \nFor example, Count Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the following exchange: \nQ: Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual \nmassages? If you know. \nA: I don't know what you're talking about. \nSimilarly, Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the following exchange: \nQ: Other than yourself . . . with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities? \nA: I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was \nwith him other than myself. \nQ: I want to make sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that in the 1990s and \n2000s, you were not aware that Ms. Epstein was having sexual activities with \nanyone other than yourself ... ? \nA: That is \nmy \ntestimony, that is correct. \nThe government has spoken to numerous individuals who claim to have been assaulted by Epstein \nafter 1997, but do not implicate Ms. Maxwell in the assault or claim that she knew about it in any \nway. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell's defense that she was not aware of either Epstein's scheme to \nrecruit and sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with \nothers, and therefore did not perjure herself in response to those questions. \nAccordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the witnesses to whom they pertain \nare exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the government's theory of the charges in the \nIndictment and must be disclosed pursuant to the government's Brady obligations. \n2. The Government Has Not Shown Good Cause that Disclosure of the Materials Will \nInterfere with an Ongoing Investigation \nEven if the Court does not find this evidence to be exculpatory, the Materials are \"material \nto preparing the defense\" and therefore should be disclosed under Rule 16(a)(1)(E). The \ngovernment agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to \ndelay the production of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule 16(d). (Dkt. \n60 at 2-3). The government's justification for the delay, however, is entirely inadequate to \nestablish good cause. \nThe government asserts that disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal to the defense \nthe identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in the Indictment, as well as \nEFTA00023332\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page 5 of 6 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nOctober 14, 2020 \nPage 5 \nsensitive information about them. (Id.). The government further asserts that such disclosure will \n\"jeopardize the government's ongoing investigation\" because it will reveal to the defendant the \nscope of the government's investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward \nto provide evidence. (Id. at 1, 3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the \nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell know, at this stage of the \nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might \nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell. \nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing \ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allow delayed \ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the \ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively \ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases \ncited in the government's own letter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 531-32 \n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might \"alert the targets of the investigation and could \nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations\"); United States v. Mennino, 480 F. \nSupp. 1182, 1188 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (government's ongoing investigation into other potential \ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts \noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient showing \nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v. \nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (collecting cases). \nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any showing that \ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize \nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional \nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of \"clearly defined, \nspecific and serious injury\" that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule 16(d)(I). \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government's requested relief under \nRule 16(d)(1) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the \nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense. \nSincerely, \nIs/ Christian Everdell \nChristian R.
