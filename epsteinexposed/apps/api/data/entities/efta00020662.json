It \nsounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new \ninvestigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00020662",
