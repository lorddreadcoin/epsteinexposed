I know we are trying to review and retain \nall the info while also doing the enforcement and investigative steps. Our boss said you guys did a pretty comprehensive \npower point? Would you guys mind providing that or anything you guys prepared to keep track of the case, I know it \nwould help me out a little, I feel like I'm drowning in information. Apologies. \nOn Aug \n17, 2019 11:59 AM, ' wrote: \nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, August 17, 2019 11:56 AM \nTo: \nSubject: emails \nEFTA00027177\n\nI am requesting emails for the following people, please let me know if there are any additions. \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOffice of the Inspector General \nNew York Field Office \nNew York, NY 10004 \n(Office) \n(Cell Phone) \nEFTA00027178",
