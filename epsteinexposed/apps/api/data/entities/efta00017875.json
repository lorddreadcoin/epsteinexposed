N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is \njust the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think \nthere is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in \ncourt. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, \nand leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or \nmore, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. \nI have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. \nI have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PII. I will send the password in a follow-on e-\nmail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I \nhave created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate \npotentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I \ncreated turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be \nobtained at a later date. \nAs I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly \ndifferent from what was included in the original e-mail to me below. \nN722JE \nnicknamed Air Ghislaine 2 \nHelicopter \nSikorsky S-76C \nAircraft Serial Number: 760750 \nDate Current Registration issued: 17 July 2019 \nCurrent Registered Owner: Hyperion Air LLC \nEFTA00017875\n\nCurrent Registration Signed By: Lawrence P.

Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft \ninformation. \nBelow are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while \nthe jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she \ntraveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger \nmanifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not \navailable.
