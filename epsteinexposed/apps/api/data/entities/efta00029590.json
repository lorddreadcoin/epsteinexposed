Nathan \nUnited States District Court \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, NY 10007 \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman. P.0 \nJeffrey Fag!loco \nwww.hmflow.corn \njpagluca@hmflaw.com \nRe: Response to Government Letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, United States v. \nGhislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan, \nI write in response to the government's letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, which \nraises two issues.' \nIdentities of Co-Conspirators \nThe government first attempts to walk back its multiple concessions regarding disclosure \nof the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment. \nAs this Court noted, Ms. Maxwell has on at least two occasions requested such \ndisclosure. Dkt. 317 at 12 n.1 (citing Dkt. 291 and Dkt. 293). Only after this Court ordered \ndisclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment did the \ngovernment finally object. The government's objection comes too late. \n'  As directed by the Court, on August 24 the parties conferred about the government's \nletter, but they were unable to reach an agreement on the government's requests for \nreconsideration. \nEFTA00029590\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 331 Filed 08/30/21 Page 2 of 5 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 30, 2021 \nPage 2 \nThe government's objection is, in substance, a motion to reconsider. \"There is `no \nspecific rule, either in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or in this district's local criminal \nrules that provide for reconsideration of a ruling in a criminal matter.' United States v. \nOkparaeke, No. 17-CR-225 (NSR), 2019 WL 4233427, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2019) (quoting \nUnited States v.  Cartagena, No. 10 Cr. 222-2, 2012 WL 2958175, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, \n2012)). Even so, courts have discretion to reconsider prior rulings in criminal cases when the \nmoving party can point to \"controlling law or factual matters which it believes the court \noverlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the court's decision.\" United States v. \nBerger, 188 F. \nSupp. 2d 307, 328-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). \nBut \"[t]he standard for granting a motion for reconsideration `is strict.' Fanner v. \nUnited States, No. 12-CR-758/15-cv-6287 (MN), 2017 WL 3448014, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, \n2017) (quoting Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., 684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2012)). \nThat's because \"[r]econsideration of a court's previous order is an `extraordinary remedy to be \nemployed in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.' Montanile v. \nNat '1 Broad. Co., 216 F. Supp. 2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). \nThe government cannot show extraordinary circumstances here. The government twice \nhad notice of Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure, and the government twice chose not to \nobject. The government cannot use a motion to reconsider to save itself from the consequences \nof its deliberate decisions. \"[A] losing party\" is not permitted to \"examin[e] a decision and then \nplug[] in the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters.\" Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 339. \nBecause that is exactly what the government is attempting to do, this Court should deny the \ngovernment's request. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the disclosure this Court ordered. \nEFTA00029591\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 331 Filed 08/30/21 Page 3 of 5 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 30, 2021 \nPage 3 \nCo\n-Conspirator \nStatements \nThe government's letter raises a second issue-disclosure of the purported co-conspirator \nstatements it intends to offer at trial. The government says that, at least as of August 18, it \nintends to seek admission of co-conspirator statements from only two individuals: Jeffrey \nEpstein and the employee of Epstein's referenced in paragraph 25(d) of the S2 Indictment. Dkt. \n320 at 2. But the government also hedges, allowing for the possibility that it might identify \n\"statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators.\" Id. \nBoth in its August 18 letter and during an August 24 conferral call, the government took \nthe position that it has no obligation to identify the specific statements it intends to offer under \nFederal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The government told defense counsel that Ms. Maxwell \ncould glean what statements might be offered from the government's witness list and exhibit list, \nonce those lists are disclosed on October 11. \nThis Court has already resolved this matter, and the government's position is another \nimproper attempt to obtain reconsideration. \nAfter conferral, the parties spelled out their positions with respect to the disclosure of co-\nconspirator statements and the identities of co-conspirators. Dkt. 291 at 5, 8-9. On June 2, this \nCourt ordered the government to disclose \"co-conspirator statements\" no later than October II. \nDkt. 297 at 1. In the same order, the Court additionally ordered the government to disclose its \nwitness list and proposed exhibit list, also by October 11. Id. The Court then ordered the parties \nto file their motions in limine by October 18 and responses by November 1.2\n2 The in limine response date since has been advanced to October 25, 2021. Dkt. 330. \nEFTA00029592\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 331 Filed 08/30/21 Page 4 of 5 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 30, 2021 \nPage 4 \nIf disclosure of the witness and exhibit lists were by themselves sufficient to give Ms. \nMaxwell notice of the specific co-conspirator statements the government intends to admit at trial, \nthis Court would not have separately ordered the government to disclose \"co-conspirator \nstatements.\" Id. But that's not what the Court did. \nThere are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission \nof alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court's decision in Bourjaily v. United States \nrequires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-\nconspirator are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. 171, 175-76 (1987). In making this \ndetermination, the Court must find that a conspiracy existed, that its members included the \ndeclarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made \nduring the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175. \nIf the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as \nthis Court already ordered the government to do by October 11, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable \nto file a motion in limine by October 18 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator \nstatements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to \ndischarge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76. Although the government \nmay not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order. \nThe government's letter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to \nreconsider its order. The government has not even attempted to identify \"controlling law or \nfactual matters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to \nalter the court's decision.\" Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 328-39. And that's because the Court \ndidn't overlook anything. The parties briefed this issue in their joint letter regarding pretrial \nEFTA00029593\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 331 Filed 08/30/21 Page 5 of 5 \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nAugust 30, 2021 \nPage 5 \nscheduling deadlines, this Court considered the parties' positions, and it made a decision. Dkt. \n297 at 1. The government has offered nothing to justify reconsideration. \nConclusion \nMs. Maxwell asks this Court to confirm what it already ordered: (1) that the government \ndisclose the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators charged in the S2 indictment at the same \ntime it discloses Jenks Act material; and (2) that, no later than October I I, the government \ndisclose the specific co-conspirator statements it intends to admit at trial. \nRespectfully Submitted, \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca \nCC: Counsel of Record (via ECF) \nEFTA00029594",
