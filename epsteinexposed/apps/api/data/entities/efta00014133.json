I also added language in paragraph (e), \nreferring to other victims, which also provides for petitioners' counsel to promptly provide a copy of the acknowledgment \nto the U.S. Attorney's Office. The government has no doubts that counsel for petitioners will ensure the authorized \nrecipients are aware of the protective order and agree to abide by it, prior to disclosure. We do not require the \nacknowledgment in writing prior to the non-prosecution agreement being disclosed to an authorized recipient. \nWe believe the petitioners' proposed protective order goes well beyond what is at issue, the government's disclosure of \nthe non-prosecution agreement, conditioned on limited dissemination of the document upon receipt by petitioners. \nConsequently, we believe the attached proposed order, incorporating your revisions, is appropriate for the task at \nhand. Thanks. \nFrom: Paul Cassell [malito \nSent: Friday, August 15 2008 12:21 PM \nTo: Brad Edwards' (USAFLS) \nCc: .(USAFLS) \nSubject: RE: Draft Protective Order - slight tweak \nHello and \nFirst, I  don't know if we've been formally introduced. Nice to meet you ... electronically at least. \nSecond, on the \nlanguage -- As Brad mentioned, we need to see this document quite quickly in view of \nthe Government's representations yesterday that Epstein is trying to ignore the agreement. As a result --\nand in view of the difficulty of making immediate contact with our clients -- I propose one \nchange. \nInstead of this: \nPrior to producing the documents to \nPetitioners' counsel, a copy of this Order must be provided to \ncounsel and their clients, who must review and acknowledge their receipt of and \nagreement to abide by \nthe terms of this Order, and who must provide a copy of that \nacknowledgment to the USAO. \nHow about this: \nBefore counsel for Petitioner's show the agreement to their clients or discuss the specific terms with \nthem, they must provide a copy of this Order to Petitioners, who must review and acknowledge their \nEFTA00014133\n\nreceipt of and agreement to abide by the terms of this Order. Counsel for Petitioner's must promptly \nprovide a copy of that acknowledgment to the USAO. \nI assume that the USAO is not concerned about us as attorneys somehow ignoring the Court's protective \norder, so this \nchange would focus in on the non-law trained clients. \nPaul G.
