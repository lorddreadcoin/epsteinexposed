I  am writing a  book and producing a documentary on a significant child trafficking case and understand you \nhave been assigned to this particular case. \nJeffrey Epstein will most likely leave the country (right after he completes house arrest on 7/21/10), for good. He does not \nhave to remain in the US since he does not NEED TO EVER work, or represent clients. He knows he CANNOT and has no \ninterest in soliciting new clients. He has made enough money ($2 billion assets according to last income tax return), to \npersonally manage his wealth and thereby save the 2% fee usually paid to an investment banker who manages large \nportfolios. \nEpstein will be free in 2 months and continue to damage vulnerable and underage girls in other countries. \nHe doesn't ever NEED to work. \nQuestion: Why hasn't the FBI not contacted attorney Robert Josefsberg in Miami in order to speak with victim \nin Australia? THIS IS STEP 1 if the FBI is truly interested in arresting him on child sex trafficking charges. \nis Jane Doe 102 in case # 09-80656. She was trafficked and prostituted and now lives with her husband and \nbabyin Australia. He settled last year with her for pennies (in comparison to what he's worth), and she now has a gag order. \nI is key witness since she was on his plane many times being paid to perform sexual activities with heads of state, \nleading businessmen, royalty, politicians and celebrities. \nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter and if you have any questions you may reach me via email or telephone \nEFTA00019169\n\nSincerely, \nThe message and any attachment may be confidential or privileged and is \nintended only for the individual or entity identified above as the \naddressee.
