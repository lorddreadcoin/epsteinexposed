Just \nargued an appeal in NY and debated the Mideast at Georgetown. I greatly appreciate your willingness to call the \nsheriff and advise him that your office would take no position on how he handled Epstein's sentence as long as \nhe didn't get special treatment, but let's put any call off for a while. . Thanks. \nAlan \nEFTA00013605",
