We still need to send this letter to and at the \nMDC to review for accuracy. Do you think you will be able to review shortly or should I send them this draft \nsimultaneously? We highlighted some language for your consideration about Judge Nathan's deadlines, happy to discuss. \nWe haven't engaged with the defense's footnote 1 about the volume of the materials delivered because that is a little \nmore complicated and we want to make sure any representations are fully accurate, but happy to discuss. \nThanks, \nFrom: (USANYS) .cM> \nSent: Friday, October 15, 2021 10:30 AM \nTo: (USANYS) \n(USANYS) \nc=> \nCc: \n<a; \nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL] U.S. v.
