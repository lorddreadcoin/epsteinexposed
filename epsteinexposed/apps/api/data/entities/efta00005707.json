An EC to the responsible Legat office indicating intended travel to \nits Area of Responsibility(AOR) with personnel information, the \npurpose of the proposed travel, and as much detail as possible. One EC \nis sufficient for multiple individuals traveling to the same AOR for \nthe same purpose. In addition to the Legat office, leads should also \nbe set to the region-specific operational unit in the Office of \nInternational Operations (0I0) for informational purposes (see \nIntranet FBI webpages for Legat AORs and OIO operational units), \nthe Security Division to request passage of the travelers' \nclearances to the respective embassies, and to CIRG at SIOC for \nthe purpose of requesting inclusion on the SIOC Foreign Travel \nReport. \n2. Completion and submission of an electronic Country \nClearance (eCC) request through the Department of State (DoS) \ninternet: https://ecc.state.gov. Step by step instructions on \nhow to complete the eCC can be found on the (MO website: \nhttp://oio.fbinet.fbi/Deployments/. Multiple travelers can be \nincluded in the same eCC request as long they have the same \nitineraries. The travelers are responsible for completing and \nsubmitting their eCC requests via the internet. \n3. Completion and submission of the Clearance Passage \nWorksheet to the Clearance Passage, Contractor, and  Law \nEnforcement Reinvestigations Unit (CPCLERU).

One \nworksheet can be filled out for a maximum of ten people and can \nbe submitted electronically. This procedure is required to \nforward your clearance to the respective embassy. \nIt should be noted that providing sufficient and \nrelevant information in the EC will provide the Legat office a \nthorough understanding of the proposed travel should any \nquestions arise from the Embassy. The granting of the Country \nClearance is ultimately the responsibility of the Chief of \nMission at that embassy and the Country Clearance approval will \nbe coordinated by the Legat office. \nWhen submitting the eCC, all information should be \nunclassified. Thus, specific details regarding the specific \npurpose of travel, the operational assistance or activity to be \nconducted, etc., should be included only in the secure/classified \nenvironment of the FBI EC. \nEFTA00005708\n\nIF THE PURPOSE OF YOUR TRAVEL IS SENSITIVE IN NATURE \nAND SUBMITTING ANY INFORMATION VIA THE PUBLIC DOMAIN COULD \nCOMPROMISE YOUR REASON FOR TRAVEL, CONTACT THE LEGAT OFFICE \nIMMEDIATELY TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS TO OBTAIN \nCOUNTRY CLEARANCE. \nBoth the EC and the eCC are required to ensure all \nparties involved in the granting of country clearances and the \ncoordination/assistance of the travelers' activities in-country \nare fully coordinated and approved prior to the travel. \nLEAD(s): \nEFTA00005709\n\nSet Lead 1:  (Action) \nMIAMI \nAT MIAMI, FLORIDA \nConduct all appropriate Country Clearance requirements \nregarding official travel to Foreign Countries as highlighted in this \ncommunication.
