First, it appears to allocate one night of the \nhotel to the travel card, which is incorrect—the entirety of the hotel was paid on my personal card (please see attached \nemail and I'm again sending the hotel invoice). Additionally, it doesn't appear to include the hotel tax of $ 70.12, which I \nalso paid on my personal credit card. \nPlease let me know when it's corrected and I'll review again. Thanks. \nFrom \nSe \nTo \nSubject: Final Voucher 1 1  414 1 prepared y a travel arranger is pending your review \nDear \nFinal voucher 10810414(1) has been prepared by your travel arranger and is ready for your review.
