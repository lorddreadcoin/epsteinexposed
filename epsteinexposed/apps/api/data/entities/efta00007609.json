    "text": "\n\nEFTA00007609\n\nAlberto, \nI \nreceived \nyour short \nletter with \ngreat \ndisappointment. \nUnfortunately, \ntoday, I \ncannot \naccept your \n\"resignation\". I'm \nsorry. but it is \nnot that \nsimple to \nabandon a \n\"family \nmember\", no \nmatter how \nfrustrating or \ngood-looking he may \nbe. \nIf my \nappreciation \nfor both you and \nyour talent \nhas not been \nadequately \nexpressed as you \nand I \nhave not spoken \ndirectly, I apologize. \nI am sure you have \nforgotten, but you \nhad initially assured \nme that the island \nproject \nwould be done \nfor last Christmas. \nI have Sways been \nboth gracious and \ngenerous in forgiving \nthe \ndates that have slipped by. \nYou and I here. I theta a unique \nunderstanding. \nJean, \nwho amend se the \nproject would be \ncomplete,by the end of \nJuly, when in fact, for \nexample, till this dg dal ate still woodso \npicking asses far tide \ntables \nin the living room, has \nyet to \ncontact me. \nEmus \nswig opposed \nto \nrive, but evenintil today, I have not been told \nwhat \nand %teethe:pat Ike Seth \nAlberto, \nit is \nyour right to take on \nonly jobs you want. It is both unfair, unfriendly and \nunprofessint to simply leave a job undone in the \nmiddle. This is not your way. I don't believe \nthat you would treat a less friendly client with the same disregard. \nI  would hope that you will reconsider the big house Island \nproject. As you know, we \nhave bought many things for the interior and \nhave incurred great expense to get permits and \ndrawings in a Moroccan style, but if you choose not to \nmove forward, I think at a minimum, my \nhouse should not be left in the state of disrepair in \nwhich it currently sits and should be brought \nto completion as soon as possible. If Jean, \nwho I have great respect for, does not want to \ncomplete it as I believe he is only an employee and as I have my total relationship not with Jean, \nbut \nwith \nCabinet Pinto, the obligation falls \non you personally. This is only right, you \nknow it is. \nAs you are aware, I  was told repeatedly that you would call me upon return from your vacation \nand both visit and finish the project. You and I have more of a friendship than my receiving, in a \nEFTA00007610\n\nfrankly \nimpolite way, only a letter and not even the phone call I  was repeatedly promised. \n(However, I Sow you don't like tension) Please call me at your earliest convenience. \nI \ntail \nyour friend \nEFTA00007611",
