New York 10007 \nNovember 18, 2021 \nBY E-MAIL \nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan \nUnited States District Judge \nSouthern District of New York \n40 Foley \nSquare \nNew York, New York 10007 \nRe: \nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (MN) \nDear Judge Nathan: \nThe Government respectfully submits this letter regarding birth certificates that are marked \nas Government Exhibits for trial.' By way of background, the Government has obtained and \nproduced to the defense certified copies of the birth certificates for each of the Minor Victims. \n(See GX-11-16). Although the Government has asked the defense to stipulate to the authenticity \nof these records, and although the defense has identified no reason to doubt the authenticity of \nthese records, the defense has not agreed to a stipulation. Accordingly, the Government seeks the \nrelief in the instant motion, to which it  is entitled under the law, and to avoid calling records \ncustodians from five state agencies with custody over the birth certificates.2\n'  The Government moves to file a  redacted version this letter motion. The proposed redactions \nare consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. \nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although this letter motion is a judicial document \nsubject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored \nto protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been publicly identified, \nand who are a subject of the Court's order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses \ntestify under pseudonyms, and third parties. \n2 The Government is coordinating with Department of Justice Office of International Affairs to \nfurther establish the predicates for self-authentication of Witness-3's birth certificate and will \nmake the appropriate motion when it is ripe. See Fed. It Evid. 902(3). \nEFTA00010105\n\nPage 2 \nFor the reasons set forth below, the birth certificates are self-authenticating under Rule 902 \nof the Federal Rules of Evidence, and no records custodian should be required to testify. The \nexhibits should be determined to be self-authenticating. \nI. Applicable Law \nRule 902 contains a  list of items that are \"self-authenticating,\" that is \"they require no \nextrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted.\" Fed. R. Evid. 902. Under Rule 902(4), \nthat list includes: \nCertified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record \n— \nor a  copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public \noffice as authorized by law — if the copy is certified as correct by: \n(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the \ncertification; or \n(B) a  certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a \nfederal statute, or a rule prescribed by the \nSupreme Court. \nRule 902(1), in turn, provides for self-authentication of the following: \nDomestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A \ndocument that bears: \n(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state, \ndistrict, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of \nthe United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands; a  political subdivision of \nany of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of \nany entity named above; and \n(B) a signature purporting to be an execution or attestation. \nFinally, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 permits a party to \"prove an official record \n. . . in the same manner as in a civil action.\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(1), in turn, \npermits proof of a domestic \"official record\" that is \"otherwise admissible and is kept within the \nUnited States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory\" through \nEFTA00010106\n\nPage 3 \na copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or \nby the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the \nofficer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal: \n. . (ii) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official \nduties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept. \nFed. R Civ. P. 44(a)(1); see Fed. R. Evid. 902 Advisory Committee Notes (\"Rule 44(a) of the \nRules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided \nauthentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records.\"). \nII. Discussion \nThe Minor Victims' birth certificates are certified and sealed by the appropriate officials, \nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 902(4). See Ball v.  A.O. Smith Corp., \n451 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"The original transcript, which includes a certification by the court \nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 902(4).1; United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x \n837, 839 (11th Cir. 2011) (\"We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 902(4), a \ncertification need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true \nand correct.\"). \nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are \"public records\" within the meaning of \nFederal Rule of Evidence 902(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 803(9) (providing a  hearsay exception for \n\"Public Records of Vital Statistics,\" including \"[a] record of a  birth . . . if reported to a public \noffice in accordance with a legal duty.\"). \nPursuant to Rule 902(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if \"certified as \ncorrect by: ... the \ncustodian or another person authorized to make the certification.\" Fed. R. Evid. \n902(4)(A). That is the case for each of the birth certificates: \nEFTA00010107\n\nPage 4 \n• The Registrar of Rhode Island Department of Health has signed and certified that \nGovernment Exhibit 12, Minor Victim-I's birth certificate, is a \"true and exact copy of the \ndocument officially registered and placed on file in the issuing office.\" \n• The Registrar of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has signed and \ncertified that Government Exhibit 13, Minor Victim-2's birth certificate, is an \"exact \nreproduction of the certificate for the person named therein as it  now appears in the \npermanent records of the Bureau of Vital Records of the Missouri Department of Health \nand Senior Services.\" \n• The Registrar of the Town of North Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, has signed \nand certified that Government Exhibit 11, Minor Victim-4's birth certificate, is a \"true and \ncorrect copy of the original Certificate of Birth on file in the Office of the Registrar.\" \n• The County Clerk/Recorder of Sacramento County, California, has signed and certified \nthat Government Exhibit 14, Minor Victim-5's birth certificate, is a  \"true and exact \nreproduction of the document officially registered and placed on file in the office of the \nSacramento County Clerk/Recorder.\" \n• The Registrar of Vital Records and Statistics for the Massachusetts Department of Public \nHealth Registry of Vital Records and Statistics has signed and certified that Government \nExhibit 15, Minor Victim-6's birth certificate, is a \"true copy\" from the Registrar's \nrecords \n\"of birth, marriage, and death required by law to be kept in my office.\" \nEach of these certifications is a  certification by a  custodian sufficient to satisfy the Rule. See \nRatajack v.  Brewster Fire Dept, 178 F. Supp. 3d 118, 128 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (concluding that \na transcript was self-authenticating based on a court reporter's certification that it contained a \"true \nrecord\"). \nEFTA00010108\n\nPage 5 \nThe birth certificates are also self-authenticating under Rule 902(4)(B). That rule permits \nself-authentication based on \"a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a  federal \nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.\" This rule is satisfied in two ways. \nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 902(1). Each certification bears \"a seal \npurporting to be that of . .. any state . ; a political subdivision ... ; or a department, agency, or \nofficer of\" a state. Fed. R. Evid. 902(1)(A). And each certification bears a \"signature purporting \nto be an execution or attestation.\" Fed. R. Evid. 902(1)(B). The certifications on the birth \ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 902(4)(B). \nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(1) explains that the evidence \nnecessary to \"evince[] an official record\" that is \"kept within the United States[ or] any state\" is \n\"a copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate \nthat the officer has custody.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)( 1)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That certification must be \"made under seal \n. . . by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political \nsubdivision where the record is kept.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(1)(B)(ii). Each of the certifications \ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate \nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v. \nWeiland, 420 F.3d 1062, 1073 (9th Cir. 2005) (concluding that records of prior \nconvictions, \nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 902(2) and \n902(4) and that \"Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(1), incorporated into Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure 27, accords with our analysis.\"). \nEFTA00010109\n\nPage 6 \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should determine that the Minor Victims' birth \ncertificates are self-authenticating. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAMIAN WILLIAMS \nUnited States Attorney \nby:  Is/ \nssis an ni e a es Attorneys \ncc: Counsel of \nRecord (by email) \nEFTA00010110",
