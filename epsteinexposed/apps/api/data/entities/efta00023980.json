    "text": "\n\nCO.P.1111S. \nBEN SASSE \nNEBRASKA \nUnited *tatcs eScnatc \nWASHINGTON, DC 2O51O \nAugust 10, 2019 \nThe Honorable William P. Barr \nAttorney General \nU.S. \nDepartment of Justice \nWashington, DC. \n20530 \nDear Attorney General Barr: \nINTELLIGENCE \nJUDICIARY \nBANKING \nThis morning, Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy American financier indicted on numerous \ncharges for running an international child sex trafficking ring, was found dead by apparent \nsuicide. Epstein was being held in federal Bureau of Prisons custody after a federal judge denied \nhim bail. Disturbingly, his suicide occurred after an incident less than three weeks ago when he \nwas found injured and semi-conscious in his cell from a possible suicide attempt. News reporting \nindicates that he was then placed on suicide watch but may have been taken off suicide watch \nbefore today's events. \nThe Department of Justice failed, and today Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators think they \nmight have just gotten one last sweetheart deal. Every single person in the Justice Department —\nfrom your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer — knew that this \nman was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him. \nGiven Epstein's previous attempted suicide, he should have been locked in a padded \nroom under unbroken, 24/7, constant surveillance. Obviously, heads must roll. \nDuring your nomination process, you committed to me to ensuring that justice would be \ndone for his victims. I was pleased to see the Department open an investigation into the \nmishandling of the ridiculous 2008 non-prosecution agreement, and then the decision to bring \nsubsequent charges against Epstein. Knowing this monster's history of thwarting justice, I also \ncalled for him to be held without bail upon his July 6 arrest. \nIt should have been abundantly clear that Epstein would go to any lengths to avoid being \nheld accountable for his crimes, including by killing himself. Being responsible for Epstein's \ncustody and prosecution, the Department of Justice should not have allowed this to happen. His \ndeath not only deprives his victims of the opportunity to confront him in court and to see him \nheld accountable for his crimes, but also makes it harder to unravel his ring and to hold \naccountable the many other powerful men who raped and exploited these children. \nThe Department must answer the following urgent questions for the American people: \n1. Was Epstein in fact placed on suicide watch following his previous possible \nsuicide attempt? \nKEARNEY OFFICE \n4111 FOURTH \nAVENUf \nKtumtv.

Can you confirm that you are ordering two investigations: one — presumably \nInspector General investigation — into the Bureau of prison's mismanagement of \nthe incarceration of Epstein; and another — presumably FBI investigation — into \nany possible criminal activity surrounding this mismanagement? \n4. Can you certify that all other potential evidence that investigators were \npursuing relating to Epstein's co-conspirators is being immediately secured by the \nDepartment of Justice, so that no additional evidence or potential testimony is \nalso squandered? \nThank you in advance for your resolve to peruse justice in this matter. \nSincerely, \ntJ, \nBen Sasse \nUnited States Senator \nChairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, \nAgency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts \nEFTA00023981",
