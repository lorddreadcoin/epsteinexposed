Cassidy\"' \nCc: \nSubject: following up \nDate: Sun, 13 Dec 2020 23:37:04 +0000 \nAll, \nThanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we have discussed. We \nwant to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this along since you've asked us to send \nyou a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final from our perspective, and this may change following \nour conversations with victims during the conferral process. \nWe recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not want to delay \nnotifying the victims, and, as we've discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims notifying them that we are in plea \nnegotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your \nclient in the next few days, so let's plan to talk mid-week. \nThanks, \nEFTA00028140\n\nEFTA00028141",
