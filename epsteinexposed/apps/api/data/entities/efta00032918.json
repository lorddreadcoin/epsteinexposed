Here, Law360 \nrounds up the noteworthy legal industry peaks and valleys with one final legal \nlions and lambs list. \nAll Talk, Little Action: BigLaw Mergers Were Scarce In 2019 \nIn a record-breaking year for total U.S. law firm combinations, blockbuster \nmerger announcements were few and far between. But experts say a slew of \nLAW FIRMS \nAllen & Overy \nAustin LLP \nBerry Appleman \nBriggs & Morgan \nCohen & Grigsby \nDavis Polk \nDentons \nDrinker Biddle \nEpstein Becker Green \nFaegre Baker \nFisher Phillips \nGray Plant Mooty \nGreenberg Traurig \nHughes Hubbard \nJones Day \nKirkland & Ellis \nLatham & Watkins \nLathrop Gage \nLeClairRyan \nMayer Brown \nMcDermott Will \nMilbank LLP \nMorgan Lewis \nO'Melveny & Myers \nOgletree Deakins \nOutten & Golden \nPepper Hamilton \nSidley Austin \nSkadden \nTaft Stettinius \nTroutman Sanders \nUlmer & Beme \nWiggin and Dana \nWilliams & Connolly \nWillkie Farr \nEFTA00032918\n\nfirms expressed interest and began feeling out a tie-up this past year, which \ncould mean merger madness at the top end of the market in 2020. \nWilmerHale \nZuckerman Spaeder \nPoetic Justice: How Judges Got Creative In 2019 \nAmid headline-grabbing decisions and groundbreaking precedent out of \nfederal courts in 2019, judges also injected bits of levity and creativity in their \notherwise serious work, quipping about that last \"Game of Thrones\" season or \nquoting the Bard. Here, Law360 presents some of the best poetry, zingers \nand pop-culture references that popped up in opinions over the past year. \nThe 7 Most Divisive Judicial Confirmations Of 2019 \nIn a banner year for judicial confirmations, senators in 2019 signed off on 20 \ncircuit judges and 80 district judges as President Donald Trump clinched his \n185th appointment — but in reaching that milestone, Majority Leader Mitch \nMcConnell faced a number of heated battles along the way. \nTHE STATE OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY \nThe Law360 400 \nKirkland & Ellis LLP has redefined what it means to be the biggest of BigLaw \n— weighing in at 2,116 attorneys by year end 2018 and becoming the first firm \nsince Law360 began tracking law firm head counts to top 2,000 U.S.-based \nattorneys. \nThe 2019 Law360 Glass Ceiling Report \nOur annual survey of the largest U.S. law firms again shines a light on the \nlack of parity for female attorneys in private practice. Though women now \nmake up more than half of law school students, the Glass Ceiling Report \nshows they continue to be underrepresented at all levels of a typical law firm \nand that their numbers dwindle as they move up the ranks. \nThe 2019 Law360 Diversity Snapshot \nU.S. law firms have long touted their commitment to diversity and inclusion. \nBut those goals still seem far from being realized. Law360's annual Diversity \nSnapshot indicates only marginal progress on racial and ethnic diversity in the \nattorney workforce from year to year, even as demands grow from clients \nexpecting more diverse legal teams. \nPODCAST \nLaw360's Pro Say: Will The Glass Ceiling Ever Break? \nFor years women have been looking around their law firms and seeing mostly \nmen in leadership. When will things change? On the latest episode of \nLaw360's Pro Say podcast we discuss our annual Glass Ceiling report, which \nreveals a glacial pace for increased gender parity in the law, and we talk to \none prominent female attorney who managed to crack the glass ceiling. \nCOMPANIES \nAltman Weil Inc. \nAmerican Bar Association \nBlueStone Natural Resources II \nLLP \nChevron Corp. \nDeloitte Touche \nErnst & Young LLP \nGoogle Inc. \nHome Box Office Inc. \nKPMG International \nLippman Jungers LLC \nMajor Lindsey & Africa \nPaypal Holdings Inc. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers \nInternational Ltd. \nSpectrum Management Holding \nCo. \nWarner Bros. \nGOVERNMENT AGENCIES \nFederal Bureau of Investigation \nNational Labor Relations Board \nU.S. Department of Education \nU.S. Department of Justice \nU.S. Supreme Court \nNot sine if your thin subscribes?
