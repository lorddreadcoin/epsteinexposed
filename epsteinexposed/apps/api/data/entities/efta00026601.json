I think we're in great shape too —  we have a lot of convincing reasons her motion should be \ndenied. \nI'm around to discuss anytime. \nThanks, \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, February 23, 2021 12:54 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: NPA \nThanks for the close read —  can the three of us chat after and IM have also reviewed? Thanks. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, February 23, 2021 12:46 PM \nTo: O; \nSubject: RE: NPA \nThanks very much, .  I think this is in great shape and is very compelling. Some small edits and my responses to your \ncomments attached. Happy to jump on a call if that would be useful. \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, February 23, 2021 2:02 AM \nTo: \nSubject: NPA \nAll, \nAttached is the most recent draft of the NPA brief. Apologies for the delay, I really struggled with this one. I think our \narguments in the first half are strong, but I'm really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your \ncomments/edits. I've also flagged a few issues for consideration/discussion. If you're able to review tomorrow morning, \nthat would be great. \nThanks, \nEFTA00026601\n\nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00026602",
