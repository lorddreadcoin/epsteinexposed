It's, of course, \npossible word gets out that she's been arrested and folks start asking for it (at which point I assume we could then give it \nto them), although I don't think the Epstein arrest did get out immediately, somewhat surprisingly. \nThat said, I also don't have any problem putting out the indictment this afternoon and announcing there will be a press \nconference first thing tomorrow morning. I know Audrey has some concerns about that, but subject to the views of the \npress office, I would think a little delay teased with the details in the indictment would heighten, not diminish, interest in \nthe press conference. \nFroM \nSent: Wednesday, July 1, 2020 9:15 AM \nTo \nSubject: Re: GM \nWe did. The difference is that the courthouse was closed. I think we would do that if it were after business hours. The \nquestion is whether the same thing applies if she is arrested at 2 p.m. today. \nOn Jul 1, 2020, at 9:11 AM wrote: \nI just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a \nday or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday \nmorning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. \nThat said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early \ntomorrow morning. \nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, July 1, 2020 9:07 AM \nTo: \nSubject: Re: GM \nEven 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested during \nbusiness hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow? \nOn Jul 1, 2020, at 9:03 AM, wrote: \nFYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. \nConsistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we \ndon't have her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be \npresented until tomorrow in any event. \nEFTA00031105\n\nEFTA00031106",
