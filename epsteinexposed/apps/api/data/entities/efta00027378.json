The FBI and AUSAs are \nable to bring the evidence to the 500 Pearl proffer rooms in order for the review to take place there. Defense counsel \nhave requested that the first day of review take place on Tuesday, April 13, 2021. Because there is a large volume of \nitems to review, defense counsel expects that the review will take multiple days. They have requested that Maxwell be \nproduced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is completed. \nWould it be possible to please have Maxwell produced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is \ncomplete? My best estimate is that the review will take four days, so Maxwell would need to be produced on April 13, \n14, 15, and 16. That said, it is always possible the defense will need more time, which would push into the next week. \nThanks very much for your help. \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1  St. Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00027379",
