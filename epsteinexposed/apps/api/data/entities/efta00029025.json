I reached out to at BOP to get an answer on their text reader capabilities. Apparently, their computers \nare equipped with text readers (as suspected). I'm still waiting to hear back on the specific program(s) that they use. I \nfigured it would be useful to know and/or include in the next discovery cover letter so that defense can't claim that she \nhas no capability to open those files. \nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 11:18 AM \nTo: (USANYS) [Contractor] \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] < \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \ncM> \n(USANYS) \nThanks for flagging. Let's produce in their original format to both for now. If Maxwell has trouble opening them at MDC, \nwe'll deal with that after she tells us she can't open them. She has not identified every single excel and txt file from past \nproductions as problematic, so she will hopefully be able to open these. \nFrom: (USANYS) [Contractor]  \nSent: Friday, September 25, 2020 10:47 AM \nTo: \n< \nCc: (USANYS) [Contractor] <>; \nSubject: RE: Epstein/Maxwell Upload \n(USANYS) \nHow are we handling producing to Maxwell vs. Counsel? With these files there are tons of text and excel files that need to \nbe converted in order to be sent to MDC.
