Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes \nNow that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of \nwhen you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. \nAt a  minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the \nattorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their \nevidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory \nbefore we start reviewing evidence. \nAlso, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? \nEFTA00030084\n\nThanks, \nLaura \nLaura A.

Please let me know if you would like to wait \nuntil all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review \nthe highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those \nhighly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all \nof your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the \nevidence vault that same week. \nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, March 9, 2021 4:56 PM \ncM>; \nTo: Laura Menninger <Imenningehmflaw.com>:\n(USANYS) \nCc: Jeff Pagliuca ipagliucaPhmflaw.com>: Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP \n(ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresseccom>; 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com>\nSubject: RE: US v.

That spreadsheet does \nnot include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 \nEFTA00030085\n\ndiscovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office \nduring the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range \nSDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. \nAs a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the \nphysical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index. \nBest, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \n1 St. Andrew% Plaza \nNew York, NY 10007 \nFrom: Laura Menninger <Imenninger@hmflaw.com>\nSent: Tuesday, March 9, 2021 3:44 PM \nTo: \n) \n) <a; \n(USANYS)\nCc: Jeff Pagliuca <jpagliucaahmflaw.com>; Christian R Everdell - Cohen & Gresser LLP (ceverdell@cohengresser.com) \n<ceverdell@cohengresser.com>; 'BOBBI C STERNHEIM' <bcsternheim@mac.com>\nSubject: RE: US v.
