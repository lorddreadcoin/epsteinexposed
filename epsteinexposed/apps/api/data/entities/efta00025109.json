Unbeknownst to = Epstein had been manipulating and sexually \nabusing her sister. had no idea that her sister had been involved in any type of sexual \ninteractions with Epstein. Epstein's power and control of sister made it impossible for \nher to say anything. \n5 \nEFTA00025113\n\nCase 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 6 of 13 \n34. met Epstein for the first time in 2002, when she was seventeen years \nold. Epstein was visiting Los Angeles, and drove with her sister to meet him at the Hotel \nBel-Air. \n35. During that first meeting, Epstein lay on a bed in his spacious hotel suite, \nfully clothed. He asked sister to massage his feet, then encouraged to join her. \nAfterwards, Epstein took them shopping, and insisted on buying several items for \n36. After that meeting, Epstein kept in touch with through frequent \nphone calls. Epstein veered the conversation toward career goals and how Epstein could \nhelp her achieve them. He purported to want to help her and guide her to a better life. \n37. Epstein offered to send to school to learn hairdressing, but \nmade clear that this was not what she wanted to do in the long term. explained that she \nhad a passion for languages and for people, and that her dream was to be a translator. \n38. Epstein claimed that he wanted to help study to become a translator. \nHe suggested that he would pay for to study in Spain for a semester. Soon after, Epstein \nhelped her to obtain a letter of recommendation from her high school counselor and helped her \nget accepted to study at the University of Madrid. \n39. was over the moon, feeling her dreams were coming true. Epstein \nmade sure she felt that it was all his doing. \n40. prepared for this exciting opportunity to study abroad and pursue \nher dream career. She gave notice at her hairdressing job and gave up her apartment in Los \nAngeles, preparing to move to Spain. \n41. Before left for her school program, however, Epstein began what \nwould become a long pattern of using her as his sexual object. \n6 \nEFTA00025114\n\nCase 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 7 of 13 \n42. In approximately the summer of 2002, Epstein flew and her sister to \nhis ranch in New Mexico. felt no reason to be wary of Epstein. He had been kind in their \nfirst meeting and had acted with generosity towards her. \n43. When got to Epstein's ranch, Epstein's close associates Ghislaine \nMaxwell and were there. Maxwell asked questions about herself and took \nher horseback riding. invited to go swimming. \n44. After swam, Epstein asked her to go into a massage room along with \nbegan massaging Epstein, and innocently joined in, as she had when her \nsister massaged Epstein's feet the first time. \n45. At that point, Epstein began fondling and took off shirt. \nbecame very uncomfortable, as the massage had quickly and unexpectedly turned into a \nsexual encounter. Epstein reached inside bathing suit and fondled her genitals. \nbegan crying, but Epstein continued to grope her as he masturbated to completion. \n46. felt extremely vulnerable. Epstein had arranged the circumstances \nto ensure that was completely at his mercy. had given up her job and her apartment \nin order to travel to Spain at Epstein's expense.

Even though Epstein had preyed upon her and \nsexually assaulted her, understood she had no choice but to submit to him. His power over \nher was all-encompassing. \n47. Epstein viciously exploited this power dynamic. In the summer and fall of \n2002, he flew seventeen-year-old to his homes in New York, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, sexually assaulting her in each of those locations. \n48. In or around December 2002, Epstein flew to stay at his townhouse \n7 \nEFTA00025115\n\nCase 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 8 of 13 \nlocated at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan. While they were in the dining room of the townhouse, \nEpstein without warning stuck his hand down pants and fondled her genitals. It was as if \nshe were his toy. \n49. In or around that same month, at Epstein's home in Florida, Epstein crept \ninto \nbedroom while she was sleeping and raped her. \n50. Also around that same month, at the private island Epstein owned in the \nVirgin Islands, Epstein ordered to massage him, then proceeded to sexually assault her in \nthe massage \nroom. \n51. finally traveled to Spain to study in or around the end of 2002. \n52. In early 2003, when was still seventeen years old, Epstein flew her \nfrom Madrid to Paris. At his home in Paris, Epstein again crept into bedroom while she \nslept and raped her. \n53. When Epstein inflicted these sexual assaults on M, she felt completely \nintimidated and fearful. All she could think about was trying to survive. Her body froze up, and \nshe began crying. \n54. After semester in Madrid, she had no home and no job. Instead, \nEpstein brought her to live a nomadic lifestyle in his close orbit. traveled around the \ncountry with Epstein and his entourage, which generally included Maxwell, =, and others. \nVirtually every few days, Epstein would bring to a different home of his, including his \nManhattan townhouse and throughout the country, where he continued to sexually assault her on \na frequent basis. Epstein regularly used his private planes to traffic into various locations \nfor his sexual abuse of her. \n55. Epstein had power over every aspect of life, and he had groomed \nto be completely dependent on him and completely submissive to him. Epstein treated \n8 \nEFTA00025116\n\nCase 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 9 of 13 \nas a sexual object, using her body for his sexual gratification frequently and at his whim. \n56. Eventually, by approximately 2004, Epstein arranged for to live in \nan apartment at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, just blocks from his townhouse, when she \nwas in New York. \n57. This pattern —  of Epstein exercising total control over life and \nusing her as a sexual object whenever he desired —  continued throughout 2003 and 2004. Epstein \narranged for to study abroad two more times, apparently when he grew bored with having \nher around. Each time, lived in this nomadic orbit with Epstein both before and after \ntraveling to attend school. \n58. Epstein also tried to introduce to his \"friends\" and essentially offer \nher as a sexual object to them. In one instance, Epstein had spend time with a well-known \nHollywood producer, who then demanded and attempted to engage in abusive sexual behavior. \nbarely escaped. \n59. By 2004, felt deep despair and isolation. There was no one she \ncould talk to about what Epstein was doing to her. Instead, Epstein had ensured that she thought \nhe was the only person in her life whom she could trust. \n60. developed a severe eating disorder, for the first time, in or around \n2004. After she had struggled with the disorder for six months or a year, it became too much to \nbear. She confided in Epstein about the eating disorder, still manipulated into thinking he was \nsomeone she \ncould trust. \n61. Instead, from the moment Epstein learned of self-destructive \nbehavior, he immediately cast her out. Literally within hours of anxiously confessing to \nEpstein that she did not know why, but had a compulsive need to binge and purge, he threw her \nout. He instructed her to pack up her belongings and arranged for her to be flown to Arizona. \n9 \nEFTA00025117\n\nCase 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 10 of 13 \n62. But there was nothing left for her in Arizona. She still had no idea what \nhad happened to her and felt it was all her fault. \n63. Epstein's abuse destroyed life. After being cast out by him after \ntwo years of a lavish, if abusive, lifestyle, she sank into alcoholism and other self-harm, unable \nto trust others but not understanding why. \n64. is now a working mother raising three children. She is still \nstruggling to put her life back together. \n65. is still in the nascent stages of understanding the deep and \nlasting injuries that Epstein's pattern of abuse has caused her, but she feels the effects every day. \nShe feels dysfunctional, on-edge, and constantly overwhelmed. She has difficulty sleeping. She \noften has flashbacks to Epstein's sexual assaults. She feels like she is on the verge of a \npsychological breakdown. \n66. This action is timely under the law of each jurisdiction whose law might \nbe determined to govern claims or aspects thereof, including without limitation \nNew York, New Mexico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands. \n67. still has not disclosed her abuse to a licensed medical or \nmental health care provider in the context of receiving health care from the provider. \n68. is still just beginning to process and understand the full extent \nof the injuries that Epstein's abuse had caused her and the connection between Epstein's abuse \nand the emotional and psychological injuries she had experienced. \n69.
