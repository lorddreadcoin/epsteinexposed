Mollo Building \nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza \nNew York, New lark 10007 \nAugust 12, 2020 \nVIA EMAIL \nJeffrey S. Pagliuca, Esq. \nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C. \n150 East 10th Avenue \nDenver, CO 80203 \nRe: United States v.  Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nDear Mr. Pagliuca: \nThe Government writes in response to your letter dated August 9, 2020 requesting to use \ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case bearing \nBates Nos. SDNY GM 00000834 through SDNY_ GM _ 00000962 (the \"Unsealing Materials\") to \nlitigate a civil lawsuit. \nAs an initial matter, the Government notes that it remains unclear whether you make this \nrequest in your capacity as defense counsel to Ms. Maxwell in the above-referenced criminal case, \nor in your capacity as her attorney in a  separate civil matter. If the former, the Government \nmaintains that the \"Confidential\" designation of the Unsealing Materials is appropriate because \nthey pertain to an ongoing grand jury investigation and because Chief Judge Colleen McMahon \nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn have ordered that the Unsealing Materials remain under seal. \nThe only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in Chief Judge \nMcMahon's April 9, 2019 Order (Bates Nos. SDNY_GM_00000904 through SDNY_GM_ \n00000905), namely that the Order itself may be provided to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, and, \npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery \nobligations, that the entirety of the Unsealing Materials may be provided to Ms. Maxwell as \ndiscovery in the above-referenced criminal case. Moreover, as noted above, the Unsealing \nMaterials relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation, and their public disclosure at this stage \nrisks interference with that investigation. Indeed, because those materials remain under seal, the \nGovernment has refrained, as it  must, from publicly responding to your baseless accusations of \nmalfeasance in the civil litigation—accusations you now know to be false. \nMoreover, the Protective Order issued by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the above-referenced \ncriminal case expressly provides that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by \nthe Government, regardless of designation, \"[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense \nCounsel solely for \npurposes of the defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding \nor any purpose other than the defense of this action.\" (Protective Order, ECF No. 36, dated July \nEFTA00021902\n\nPage 2 \n30, 2020, q¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added)). The Government notes that counsel for Ms. \nMaxwell consented to that limitation when negotiating the Protective Order in the criminal case. \nAccordingly, regardless of designation, the Protective Order expressly prohibits use of any \ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case in any \ncivil \ncase. \nTo the extent you make this request in your capacity as counsel to Ms. Maxwell in civil \nlitigation, the appropriate mechanism for obtaining these materials from the Government would \nbe a request for records through the Freedom of Information Act or through a  Toughy request, to \nthe extent such materials are obtainable through either process, in the same manner as any other \nlitigant seeking to use records from a federal criminal investigation in a civil case. If you wish to \nmake such a  request, the undersigned can refer you to the appropriate Assistant United States \nAttorney in our office's Civil Division, who will process your request. \nVery truly yours, \nAUDREY \nSTRAUSS \nActing United States \nAttorney \nBy: \n/ \nAssistant United States Attorneys \nSouthern District of New York \nTel: \nEFTA00021903",
