In response to this offer, Mr. \nBrown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither \na target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about \nwhich the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time. \n\"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the \nGovernor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed,\" said \nMr. Brown. \nFurthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor \nby any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so \nthat Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice \nthey deserve. \nJeffrey Brown \nDechert LLP \n1095 Avenue of the Americas \nNew York New York \n10036 \nDirect: \nFax: \nOn \nAug 21, 2019, at 1:12 PM, \n) < \n> wrote: \nEFTA00032920\n\nHey no attachment, please re-send?
