He assisted Jeffrey Epstein in \nsourcing and disposing of works of art and may very well have loaned items to him as well. I  understand that \nJeffrey Epstein owed him a substantial sum of money in consultation fees in relation to works of art and that I \nwould therefore have a claim on the estate in consideration of this. \nMy father did mention in passing the presence of young girls with Jeffrey Epstein and had he not sadly died I \nexpect my father would have reported his concerns to the relevant authorities \nI need to communicate with the US Attorney Geoffrey Berman in charge of the case against Jeffrey Epstein —  can \nyou therefore please pass this information on to him. My postal address is:-\nDavid Rowlands \nEmail:-\nTel H \nEFTA00024431\n\nI attach scans of my passport, birth certificate and my father's death certificate along with my most recent \nphonebill as proof of my address and identity / connection. \nYours faithfully, \nDavid Rowlands \nEFTA00024432",
