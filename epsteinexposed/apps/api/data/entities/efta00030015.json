Nathan \nUnited States District Judge \nUnited States Courthouse \n40 Foley Square \nNew York, NY 10007 \nDear Judge Nathan: \nNew York, New York 10011 \nMarch 31, 2021 \nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell \nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) \nThis week's filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating \nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to 10 years, the government has added \ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made \nthis move late in the game —  with trial set for July 12th—is obvious tactical gamesmanship. \nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in \nthe government's possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of power. More than \ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from 1994 to 2004 (previously \n1997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation; \nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed \nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to \nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required. \nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell's \nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests now clash with her right to effective assistance of \ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell's detention, its \ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be \nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial. \nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This \ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for \ntrial. However, the government's continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery —  names \nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the \nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented \ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested \nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of \nmoving the trial date. \nEFTA00030015\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 2 of 3 \nLAW OFFICES OF 13O13131 C. STERNHEIM \nTo be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay \nher trial but rests squarely on the government's late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution. \nAt the initial appearance on July 14, 2020, the defense agreed to the July 12ih trial date \nbased on the government's representation that is would not file a superseding indictment: \nThe trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of \ncourse subject to the court's \napproval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is \none, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I \nassume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial \nschedule but other schedule as well. \nJuly 14, 2020 Transcript at 16 -17 (emphasis added). \nIn response, the Court made the following inquiry: \nLet me go ahead and ask, Mss Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I \nwill ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments \nadding either defendants or additional charges? \nId. at 17. \nThe government confirmed: \nMS. \nYour Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we \ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment. \nId. \nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July 12, 2021 trial date and her \nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date. \nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government \nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The \ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial \nmotions and government concern about the now-apparent weakness of its case. The government \nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and \nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel's readiness for trial and \nMs. Maxwell's prolonged detention. \nThis is no longer the \"two-week\" trial as represented by the government. By adding \ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally \ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time allotted. The continual media \nattention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely \nrequire the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right \ncan be guaranteed. \n2 \nEFTA00030016\n\nCase 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 3 of 3 \nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM \nMs. Maxwell is entitled to a fair trial with effective assistance of counsel. If counsel feel \nthat additional time is required to guarantee those constitutional rights, Ms. Maxwell will suffer \nthe consequence by her continued detention. The Court has the power —  and, indeed, the \ndiscretion —  to accommodate this constitutional clash. Granting a continuance and releasing Ms. \nMaxwell on the most restrictive conditions of home detention. Surely, the Court can impose \nconditions that \"clip her wings\" and satisfy perceived flight concerns without keeping Ms. \nMaxwell locked in a BOP cage. \nAs counsel has notified the government, Ms. Maxwell is requesting an in-person \narraignment. She will not waive that right, most especially in light of media coverage and the \ndebacle that occurred during a remote proceeding in a related civil case before Judge Preska. \nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is requesting a bail hearing at which witnesses will testify regarding \nthe purported strength of the government's case. Further, we request that these proceedings be \nscheduled to coincide with an evidence review session at the U.S. Attorney's Office to be \nattended by Ms. Maxwell with counsel. \nYour consideration is greatly appreciated. \nVery truly yours, \ngag \nC. 544,\n14.:..n. \nBOBBI C.
