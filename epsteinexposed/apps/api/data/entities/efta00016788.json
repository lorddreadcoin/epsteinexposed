This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government's Memorandum \nin Opposition to the Defendant's Renewed Motion to Release dated 16 December \n2020, insofar as it pertains to matters of English extradition law and practice. \n2. The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2020 (`the Opinion') \nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and \nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it \nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances \nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United \nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information \ncurrently known, it is highly unlikely' that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able \nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the \nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2020. In addition to those conclusions, the \nfollowing three points may be made. \n3. First, as noted in the Opinion2,  Ms Maxwell's waiver of extradition would be \nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a \ndocument cannot compel a  requested person to consent to their extradition once in \nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any \ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular: \n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United \nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that \nThe Government observes, at p.16 of the Motion, that this leaves open a  \"possibility\" that extradition could be \nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is \nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently known, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances \nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a  virtual foregone \nconclusion. \n2  Opinion, para. 39. \nEFTA00016789\n\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be \nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings. \n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwells require \nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be \noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars \nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to \nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made \nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances \nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her \nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her \nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in \nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under \nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights \nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in \nthe Opinion4. \n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly \nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to \ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism. \n4. Second, it  is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2003 \n(`the \n2003 Act') \nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is \nsent to her by the extradition judges.  The ambit of the power in section 93 is \ndescribed at paragraph 8  of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse \nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable \nbar to extradition6  is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the \nrequest has been withdrawn7; (c) there is a  competing claim for extradition from \n3 Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition. \nOpinion, pares. 27-29 and 36.37. \ns \nAs appears to be submitted by the Government at p.19 of the Memorandum. \n6 The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality \n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the \nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A). \n7 Extradition Act 2003, s. 93(4Xa). \nEFTA00016790\n\nanother states; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian protection in \nthe United Kingdoms;  or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK \nnational security1s.  On the information currently known, none of these bars or \nexceptions would arise in the case of Ms Maxwell. \n5. The exceptional nature of the Secretary of State's power is illustrated by the fact that \nit has been exercised in the favour of a requested person on only one occasion since \nthe enactment of the 2003 Act, and that that single exercise of the power was based \non grounds on which reliance may not now be placed.\" \n6. Third, as to the timescales of extradition proceedings arising from requests for \nextradition made by the Government of the United States, it  is to be noted that the \npurpose of the 2003 Act to streamline extradition procedures\" and, in practice, the \nlegislation works to facilitate extradition. As noted in the Opinion13  the majority of \nextradition cases conclude within two years, or three months in cases where consent \nto extradition is given. \nDavid \nPerry QC \n6KBW College Hill \n17 December 2020 \nExtradition Act 2003, ss. 93(4Xb), 126(2) and 179(2). \n9  Extradition Act 2003, s. 93(4Xc) and (6A). \n1D Extradition Act 2003, s. 208. \n'' viz. in the case of Gary McKinnon, whose extradition was refused by the Secretary of State in 2012 on the \nbasis that he was seriously mentally ill and that there was a  high risk of suicide were he to be extradited; since \nthat decision, the Secretary of State has been barred from refusing extradition on the basis of human rights \ngrounds: Extradition Act 2003, s. 70(11) (as inserted by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 with effect from 29 July \n2013). \n12  IVelsh v United States [2007] 1  WLR 156 (Admin) para. 26. \nI9  Opinion, para. 13. \nEFTA00016791",
