This letter \nand the content herein is designated as \"Protected Materials\" pursuant to the Protective Order \nentered in this matter. \nThomas Request.  The Government refers to its prior response to this request, as stated at \nthe November 25, 2019 pretrial conference. \nNoel Requests No. 1-10, 12-13.   We note, at the outset, that many of these requests are \nextremely broad and pertain to information that does not appear to be relevant to the case. To the \nextent material called for by these requests is within the Government's possession and subject to \ndisclosure at this time, the Government has already disclosed such information to you, including \nby letter dated January 24, 2020. To the extent these requests call for information that is not \ncurrently in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no \nlegal basis or authority for these requests, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to \nobtain and/or disclose this information. \nNoel Request No. 11.  The name of the MCC technician referenced in the Government's \nprevious letter is \nNoel Request No. 16. The Government has already produced the available video \nsurveillance in its possession for July 23, 2019 for the Special Housing Unit. The Government \nattaches hereto two public filings in United States v.

These requests, in general terms, call for information about \nwhere particular evidence may be located within the discovery produced to date. As you note, you \nseek this information to \"assist in expediting the ability of the defense to be ready for trial.\" \nAccordingly, with respect to Noel Requests No. 14-15, 17-23, at your request and solely as a \ncourtesy to aid you in your review of discovery, the Government is providing the information that \nfollows. The Government's response to your requests should not be used for any other purpose, \nnor should it be construed as a representation that only these files or portions of the surveillance \nvideo are potentially relevant to the Government's case or any potential defense, or as a \nrepresentation that the identified portions are the only portions of surveillance video that would be \nresponsive to your requests. The Government expressly reserves the right to identify and/or offer \nat trial additional material as probative of any of the issues identified in these requests. \nNoel Request No. 14.
