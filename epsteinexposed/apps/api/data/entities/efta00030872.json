The drive will be \nready tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming \nweekend, but no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that \nMaxwell would not receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to \npick the drive up from our office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. \nWould that be permissible? \nThank you, \nAssistant United States Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nNew York, NY 10007 \nEFTA00030873",
