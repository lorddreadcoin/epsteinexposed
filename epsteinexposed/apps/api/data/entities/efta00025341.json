He should be able to \nanswer your questions regarding what he's processed. \nOn Sep 30, \n2019 1:57 PM, '1 \nM \nwrote: \nThe taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer \ndocuments than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, \ncomputers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact \nprocessed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. \nMy understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately \n38 computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs. \nthanks, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney \nSouthern District of New York \nEFTA00025341",
