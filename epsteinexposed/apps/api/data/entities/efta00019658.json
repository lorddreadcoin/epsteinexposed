It's not the lawsuit the victims filed against the government to \ninvalidate the NPA. And it's not one of the suits the victims filed against Epstein. It's a lawsuit that an attorney \nwho represented multiple victims filed against Epstein for malicious prosecution. Sort of a complicated \nbackground: previously Epstein sued the lawyer, claiming that the lawyer was involved in an unrelated fraud that \nthe lawyer's law partner was convicted of-- the fraud related to an Epstein business. The lawyer is now suing \nEpstein for malicious prosecution, claiming that he wrongfully filed the old lawsuit in retaliation for representing \nEpstein's victims. \n> Original Messa e \n> u \nject: pstein \n> The December 4 trial - is that the one against DOJ or against Epstein?
