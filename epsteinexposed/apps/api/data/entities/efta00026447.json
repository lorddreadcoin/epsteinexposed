The investigation arises from conduct alleged to have occurred from in or \nabout the 1990s through at least in or about 2007. \nEpstein is alleged to have engaged in a years-long pattern of enticing minor girls to \nengage in sex acts, starting with massages and escalating to acts including sexual intercourse, \noften in exchange for money. He has undertaken this conduct in at least New York, Florida, the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and certain cities abroad. Esptain was assisted by individuals, \nincluding employees, girlfriends and friends, in the recruitment and enticement of the minors, \nand he paid certain minors to recruit additional underage girls. \nWe estimate that there are at least 50 victims who were abused in New York, Florida and \nelsewhere, and who currently live throughout the United States and abroad. Significant \ninvestigative costs include frequent travel to interview victims and witnesses, and hiring a vendor \nto process voluminous paper records and media, among other costs. \nPage 2 of 2 \nExecutive ice for United States Attorneys \n600 E Street, NW Washington, DC 20530 \nEFTA00026448",
